 This is a great DVD,the extra documentary discusses the history and current use of QIGong, with actual footage of the Masters in China. I found the QiGong easy to follow and to work into my personal schedule. It breaks it up into several simple areas and if I don't have time for the complete session I can do the areas I need most. I am a Reiki Master and I wished to broaden my energy work, this was really useful. I am also struggling to learn accupressure and QiGong in a 100 hr introductory class, this helped learning several of the movements my instructor was also trying to teach. To observe QiGong practised well, reminds me of watching ballet, as it is very graceful, with rounded movements that are enjoyable to watch and practice. As a nurse I am interested in energy work and exercise that can maintain health, flexibility, balance and strength that complements western medicine. QiGong can be a powerful tool to acheive this. I really enjoy this DVD as it is very well presented. I highly reccomend it!
