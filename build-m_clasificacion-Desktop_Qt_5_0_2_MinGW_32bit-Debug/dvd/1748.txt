 This is one the greatest horror classics of all time. Ash (Bruce Campbell) pulls it off as the bumbling hero in this third entry of the Evil Dead Trilogy. I have seen the film many times, and yet never tire of viewing it. I must say I was delighted and pleased when I watched the film in the theatres, and laughed at the entire film's concept of humor that was put into it. Being catapulted back into 14th-century and having to battle the evil forces of the dead are just great. Moreover, you notice how Ash's attitude toward these evil creatures are very nonchanlant? It's as if there is nothing more that can scare him. And his demeanor towards everyone, including the people of the time are funny in the way he interacts with them. The part where he forgets the words that he is supposed to use when getting the necromicon are hilarious. Not only that, but the dialogue of the recently awakened dead are funny! This film is highly recommended. It is hilarious, funny, and a little bit of horror [a gentle horror]. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+
