 Spun is an absolute pleasure to watch. It doesn't wait around to get noticed, instead it sets it's own pace, like for example - No credits roll in the beginning, no apologetic character introductions, there is no STOP sign in this film, everything is unhooked and raw,YET nothing seems to be out of place. The direction is bizzare, camerawork is staggering at places, the sets are like gutters, the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level. There are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too. The reason I compare Spun with Run Lola Run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the German wonderflick was. Spun is possibly one of a kind. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Trainspotting. Now, that is saying a lot. Unfortunately, I haven't seen many movies like Spun in Hollywood. So I have no recommendations. This is an absolute must watch, if there ever was one
