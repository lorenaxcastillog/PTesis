 A superlatively fascinating and must-see film. I watched enthrallingly such an awesomely produced film; acting, scenes, affects, but above all the truth of "The Truth and the lie." "The Truth is the truth even if no one believes it, and a lie is a lie even if everyone believes it..." This film clearly shows the extreme and abysmal difference between Good and Evil or truth and lies. It clearly shows that Truth has already overcome evil. It has been vanquished. It is up to each and every one of us to work out our salvation in fear and trembling... This movie helps one come to terms with the seriousness of one's eternal salvation and the dangers which can lie in wait for us if we allow ourselves to be caught up in lies. We must pray for truth and discernment so as not to succumb to temptation that endangers our eternal soul
