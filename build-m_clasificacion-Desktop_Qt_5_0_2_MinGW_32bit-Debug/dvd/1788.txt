 When Hollywood discovers Anime a lot of writers, actors,directors and musicians are going to be looking for jobs. This story has it all, action, romance comedy and intrigue all wrapped together in eight exciting volumes.I'm in awe of the Japanese. Their sense of timing, the camera angles that they use, the sense of grandeur and majesty that they are able to pull off is nothing short of a miracle. Escaflowne represents the best this medium has. The powerful but mysterious Guymelefs, Van the dragonslayer, Hitomi the fortune-telling girl from the &quot;Mystic Moon&quot;, Allen the dashing white knight, and Dornkirk the alchemist and his fate-machine. Escaflowne is an epic in the true sense of the word and a sweet little fable where all the characters have pointy noses. If you're tired of waiting for the good Hollywood directors to come out with a decent movie (James Cameron, etc.) check into Escaflowne and Japanimation. You may forget about live-action movies altogether
