 I like this video. I love that you can customize your workout and do the segments you want to in the order you choose. I feel like the intensity doesn't come often enough up and stay there long enough. Some of the moves are really fun but the cueing is just ok and could be a bit better. I do not recommend this workout at all for someone new to exercise. There is absolutely no instruction as to proper form which could result in some serious injuries. Additionally, people with joint and knee problems should look elsewhere because this is definitely high impact. Suggestion for the next program your own workout would be to make a warm up and cool down (both a bit longer)seperate selections and allow people to choose them once so you're not bringing your heartrate back down every 10 minutes. As far as aerobic videos go, it's a pretty good one (compared to what's out there when you don't have an hour to exercise!) and I'll use it often because of the time I don't have to workout!
