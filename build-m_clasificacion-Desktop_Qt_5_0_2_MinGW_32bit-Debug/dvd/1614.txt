 I think it's a very watchable movie that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is...a well-crafted, commercial vehicle for two big stars. Gibson was entertaining doing paranoia and Julia Roberts was just fine. I thought both Patrick Stewart and his nose kept you watching. The scene where Gibson takes Roberts to his apartment was clever and funny. But I didn't care for the ending. (Maybe a spoiler ahead) I could see no reason why Hollywood couldn't find a way for Gibson and Roberts to get together. The movie reminds me in a way of another big, commercial movie with Julia Roberts, The Pelican Brief. Both are obviously made by professionals, both are great popcorn movies, both have interesting set pieces, and both -- for me -- have unsatisfying endings. For the Pelican Brief, I think she should have had, at minimum, a smooch or two with Denzel Washington
