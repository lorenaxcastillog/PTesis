 I truly do appreciate when the time is taken to make a worthwhile subject to a few, interesting and accessible to many. My background is in civil engineering and I am a history buff. When the subject came up one day with my kids and spouse about the Panama Canal (I know, not general conversation) I remembered seeing this documentary. Fortunately, it had just come out in DVD (June 2004). Not only does it explain the engineering aspects in 'real people' language and visuals, but it tells the story of the people who made this happen through endurance and great hardship. And I was pleasantly surprised it did not cover the truth regarding the U.S. acquisition of the rights to the land for the Canal. I know if more 'archaic' subjects could be given this treatment, more kids and adults would be enriched by the knowledge. I will purchase this DVD in the near future
