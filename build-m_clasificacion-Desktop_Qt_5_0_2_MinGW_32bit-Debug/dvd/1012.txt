 Many actors want to take a turn at directing and some do quite well. Witness Clint Eastwood and UNFORGIVEN. Then there is Billy Bob Thornton who wrote and directed SLING BLADE. Mr. Thornton plays a mentally retarded man who wacked his mother and her lover to death with a type of grass-cutting tool called a "sling blade". After serving his term in the "nervous hospital", Mr. Thornton's character is released to fend for himself. Back in his home town, he finds a job fixing small engines and winds up staying with a woman and her son. Dwight Yoakum does a fine acting job as the woman's abusive boyfriend. John Ritter is funny and sweet as a gay store owner in a small town. Look for Robert Duvall in a cameo role. This viewer was just awed by Mr. Thornton's excellent portrayal of the mentally challenged man. A bit of an emotional downer but five stars for an all-around good script, good acting and good directing
