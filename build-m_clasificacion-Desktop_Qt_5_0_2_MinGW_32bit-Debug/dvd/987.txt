 Awesome movie overall!!.. this is the kind of movie that relax your mind after a hard day at work and gets you in a trip; just imagine if you can do what Alice do!!. Anyway.. the picture quality is awesome, brilliant colors, organized settings (same as the book), good ol' songs (although i don't like musicals) and specially good acting. Back then i remember enjoing everything, but know as an adult and tech fan i would prefer a bit of CGI here and there, less songs and the kind of puppetry that Jim Henson created; not people with painted faces in costumes. That is why i can't wait when dreamworks do the remake with Dakota Fanning (hopefully mantaining the book sequence). And yes.. i know.. this is a classic and should stay this way, but a little tech doesn't hurt.. jeje. But all in all it doesn't matter cause this is an amazing fantasy movie... so.. you need to have it in your collection Ez.
