 Having had the experience of being one of the 1411 German U Boat Commanders in my previous life, and having died and been reborn into this life here in the U.S. all during the 1940s, this film depicts life aboard an unterseeboot (underseaboat) nearly as perfectly as was humanly possible for someone to accomplish three and half decades after the war ended and without the current phoniness of the current computer images which pervade the film industry and have for quite some time. This film even showed scenes which depicted that some of the Kreigsmarine (German Navy) were not at all impressed with how the Fuhrer (Guide) was running the country towards his imagined goals, which was a fact. The long running time of the film was neccessary so that everything that the director wanted to convey to his audience could be experienced. To miss this film is to miss out on reality..
