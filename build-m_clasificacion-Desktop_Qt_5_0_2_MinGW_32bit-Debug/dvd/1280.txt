 Amazing. What do you do when you're divorced, you just got fired from the only job you've ever had, and your only son is slipping further and further away from you? You build a house. Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen star in this drama about finding yourself, love, and friendship. Kristen Scott Thomas, Jena Malone, Mary Steenburgen, and Ian Somerhalder are the perfect supporting cast for this critically acclaimed film, they really help bring it to life. It's impossible to watch this movie and walk away without anything. Every time I watch it, I get something new. It could be perspective or just an idea. Hayden's character Sam is a true depiction of what teenagers are like today, he's not some overly happy teen that loves his parents and respects authority. A lot of recent movies have been trying to pass this for the truth and I'm glad someone finally decided to change it. Sam is reluctant to spend the summer with his father (portrayed be Kevin Kline), but is it too late? Can he learn that there are some things in life that can't be changed? Is all love lost?
