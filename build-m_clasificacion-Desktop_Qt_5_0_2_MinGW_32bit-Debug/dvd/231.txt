 This movie may be unfamiliar to American viewers, who watch american movies only. But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov. In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day. The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says "Chort Poberi" (which means something like "damn", or "hell", or "go to the devil" in russian language.) This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end... Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2
