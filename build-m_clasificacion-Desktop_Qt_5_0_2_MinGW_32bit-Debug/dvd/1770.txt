 All of you should know "Little Red Riding Hood", but in this movie, it shows what really happened on that crazy fairy tale. Ever since the Goody Bandit started to steal recipies from goody shops, all except one store shut down. In the movie, you have the four characters (Red, Wolf, Granny, and Woodsman) telling the police about what really happened. Positive: Unlike other movies (Shrek, Monster House, Ant Bully), Hoodwinked is very clean. It features jokes that are funny for kids, but also funny for adults and teens (Though teens would rather see Scary Movie 4). Negative: Nothing negative on Hoodwinked!!! Conclusion: Hoodwinked is a very funny movie. I highly recommend it for the whole family. Though this film is rated PG for Mild Violence and Thematic elements, you should realise that MPAA have been rather goofy and were thinking that a snowball fight is deadly. Ignore the PG rating and go to Wal-Mart or go on Netflix and go watch this movie
