 I gave the item five stars (although I haven't viewed it--it is a gift), but this review is about NEW unacceptable Amazon packaging for this item. I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. I received it in a brown box with a shipping label. When the box was turned over, there was a peek-a-boo hole in the box approiximately 2.5" x 3.5" exposing the invoice. The order number, content information and price were ALL visible through the hole. If you are concerned about privacy or if you are buying this as a gift and wish to keep the contents secret from another household member, you may want to purchase this item elsewhere or make plans to be the only one picking up the mail until after it arrives. I have purchased MANY things from Amazon and this is the first time I have received anything in this type of box. I hope it will be the last.
