 Having glanced at the other customer reviews, I'm surprised at the lukewarm ones. I'm in my mid-40s and my husband is in his late 50s. We're certainly no prudes, but at first I was hesitant to rent "Blow Dry" because of the title and cover photo (I thought it might fall into the popular crude-humor category geared toward teens and young adults). Nevertheless, I went ahead and rented it; after reading the plot synopsis, I thought the movie might be somewhat similar to other quirky comedies we've loved ("Waking Ned Devine", "Saving Grace", and of course, "The Full Monty"). I was right, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. OK, Hartnett's accent is neither perfect nor consistent, but so what? And we certainly didn't expect it to be a heavy, "important" movie, so finding it to be a delightfully fresh comedy more than satisfied us. Alan Rickman was super, as were the other actors. Just approach it in a spirit of lightheartedness and fun and you'll be pleased. P.S. Although "Blow Dry" isn't just about hair, we're planning to give our hairdresser the DVD for Christmas, and we feel sure she'll love it
