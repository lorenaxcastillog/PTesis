 Brett Fetzer needs to get a clue, you don't understand something, generally you shouldn't be doing reviews for it. Amazon's review is so off the mark you have to wonder if he actually watched the film. "Human Traffic" is so on the mark you'd have to be an idiot not to enjoy it. "HT" and "Trainspotting" have absolutely nothing in common, and in no way should they be compared. Just because they're both European films doesn't mean they're trying to be the same movie. That's like saying "Saving Private Ryan" wasn't funny compared to "Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot" becasue they're both American movies(Although "SOMMWS" was lame to begin with). Check out this movie, even if you're not familiar wtih the culture you should laugh your buns off. Also if you like this movie check out the directors new movie "It's All Gone Pete Tong" just as god of a movie, not as scary as "28 Days Later" though, cause that was british too
