 The Shawshank Redemption is a movie I never get tired of watching! Tim Robbins owns the screen and is superb as Andy, adept at showing who Andy is as each facet is slowly revealed. Andy . . . upstanding as the banker . . . vengeful as the drunken man who murders both his wife and her lover . . . stoic as the accused . . wary as the new prisoner . . . punished as the victim . . . silent as the watchful one . . . captive as the warden's bookkeeper . . . demeaned as the shoeshine man . . . refined as the classical music lover . . . clever as the master of deception . . . brilliant as the embezzler . . . crafty as the escapee . . . devious as the whistleblower . . . loyal as a friend . . . safe as a free man. Bob Gunton gives an excellent performance as the corrupt warden undone by greed! The brilliant Morgan Freeman shines as Red, giving a superlative performance as narrator, prisoner, observer and friend! The Shawshank Redemption is sure to be listed among the classics!
