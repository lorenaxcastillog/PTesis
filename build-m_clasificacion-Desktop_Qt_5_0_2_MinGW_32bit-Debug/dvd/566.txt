 I suppose because I wasn't game for another film about the terrible, awful, mean-spirited decade of the 80s which I managed to survive. 'American Psycho', great as it was, had done me in and satisfied my anger. I don't think Mike Nichols hits one false note in this epic, and I was taken in by almost all of the performances. Streep, Pacino and Wilson are stellar in hitting peak moments with grace; Parker is comical and endearing. While so many films out there are as false as advertising on prime time TV, and exist as nothing but wallpaper to pass time and pacify the hoi polloi, I was so pleased to rent something with something valuable on its mind. And no, it's not just another film about the Immune Deficiency years. It's about so much more. So much. Mainly the rewards of forgiveness and reaching past one's grievances to see the reality of another person as oneself staring back at you. And that's not a minor thing regardless of how jaded, postmodern, drowning-in-irony one may be. True, the talking-to-the-camera approach at the conclusion could have been scratched, but for a 4 - hour epic... small complaint.
