 Natural Born Killers is one of the most controversial films ever made and why would't it? a film about seriel killers? thats got to push some buttons there. not only that but several real life murders were copied of this film and even dialouge was reportedly said during the killings. so why see such a film? when it hits the right marks and pulls it off. Stone combines such wild, lush, and crazy film editing to depict the minds of Vickey and Mallory, crazy dialogue, unique story telling, and all the while poking fun at how we as the people and the media go crazy for it. the film tells of the two sociopaths in love, Vickey and Mallory, as they cut a blood soaked path across america while the public goes crazy, making them into pop culture icons. for some, they will love the movie but for others they may be turned of at the violence in the film and some of the scenes shown so just a little forwarding. but still, if your an Oliver Stone fan then this movie is a must for your collection
