 someone thought this movie wasn't believable, that I don't understand. For me 99% of movies are not believable, unless theya re documentaries. Does that make sense? Maybe, maybe not...really, curious. That aside...this movie is simple about "who can you trust". That goes a long way without saying it when you watch it. There's this girl, who may seem materialistic and shallow, actually looks past that when it comes to people. She gives trust even when she has been betrayed...maybe a part of the character she plays. It is as though she says, punch me in the face and then let me shake your hand...all is forgotten. It seems as though she lives by that code, because of her "condition", she doesn't really have that chance, so she gives to others...hoping to only be rewarded. Eventually though, someone sees what she does...and why she does it, and it changes them. Urband legends and myths aside, it's about enduring trust. Not many can give it, but it can change a person when it's offered. Great acting from a lovely actress
