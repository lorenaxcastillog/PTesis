 Though there is a little weak material on this DVD, the whole is an item absolutely essential to the Broadway lover's collection. You will replay many of the sequences over and over, like Jeter and Barrett's smashing scene from Grand Hotel (even my musical-disliking friends liked this one), Gregory Hines and his peerless company in Jelly's Last Jam, and Jerry Orbach's turn as Billy Flynn in Chicago. On the other hand, the Coco sequence is long, dull, and forgettable; the girl playing next to Hepburn is incredibly bad, and it's a surprise that someone like her would be on the Broadway stage. I thought the Me and My Girl sequence was also long, dull, and forgettable, with a repetitive song and a dance that seemed less than brilliantly choreographed. I just wish they would ultimately release all the Tony performances; in most cases, these are the only surviving snippets of much classic theatre, and whether they're "treasures" or not they're always worth seeing and preserving
