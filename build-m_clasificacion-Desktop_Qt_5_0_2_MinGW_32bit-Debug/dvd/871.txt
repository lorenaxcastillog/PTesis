 Ignore all those Harry Potter nerds who say that it wasn't like the book, I mean who cares if it wasn't exactly the same as the book the film still turned out to be good and is a great follow up in the series. The missing scene involved that house elf from the book but it is not important, its great seeing all the characters grow up onscreen as they grow older the films become more serious but are still fun to watch. This film concentrates more on the Tri-wizard Tournement as Harry tries to prove that hes the most qualified and experienced wizard even though the senior wizards are giving him a hard time, you also get to see harry, Ron and Harmione prepare for the ballroom dance so there is alot of humor in it as well as some dark scenes when Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes finaly makes an appearence (in person and not as something else) and has a confrontation with Harry Potter. Overall I would say that this film was great but not my favorite I still prefer Prisoner of Azkaban
