 Buffy the Vampire Slayer is without question, television at its greatest. With 144 episodes of pure genius, there is never a dull moment while watching the series. It is one of the few shows that I am able to watch the same episode over and over and over without ever getting sick of it. As for this box set, I highly recommend it to ANY Buffy fan! The packaging on the set is outstanding! Each season is divided into seperate books (that is the best way to describe them). The 40th extra DVD is also really REALLY good! Its filled with interviews from various members of the cast and crew. There is also a group discussion type thing that includes people such as Joss Whedon (the creator), Nicholas Brendon (Xander), Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia), Emma Caulfield (Anya), and a few others. I can't tell you how pleased I am with this set, and I think that the price is quite a bargain considering the great packaging and contents! I would have paid WAY more money for something this great!
