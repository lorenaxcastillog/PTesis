 I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now. Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie. Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the "holy lands" of rock. If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it. Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland. Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written. By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career. Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage. Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride. It's only rock'n'roll
