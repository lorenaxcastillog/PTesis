 Okay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing.Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used
