 Coming, as I do, from `across the pond,' I must confess that I am not a fan of American humour, but this film is absolutely hilarious. It seems to me that HBO have used comedy to tell a frighteningly true story that differs, only in detail, from the `expert' reviewer's opinions. We all know that Holywood has never let the facts interfere with the telling of a story. As a keen amateur medieval historian I frequently cringe in disbelief, and often get irate, with their interpretation of historical fact. I have yet to see an historical interpretation that is concerned solely with the facts, and does not contain some (or even a great deal of) `poetic licence.' However such licence does not necessarily make a film `bad', after all we are talking about entertainment, aren't we? Pentagon Wars is funny, even hilarious, entertaining and thought-provoking, and despite what anybody else may say, it is well worth the 5 stars I award it.
