 I have to qualify this review in that I viewed this DVD that a friend had purchased for themselves; they wanted something that wasn't immensely detailed, and they felt it was a good reference tool for their needs. I had purchased Martha's "Complete Weddings" DVD, so it was an interesting comparison of the two. If you are looking for a brief overview of wedding planning, then this would be a very well-done general reference guide. It will give you an overview of wedding day idea's and will be most helpful. You get a little bit of flowers, dresses, cakes, atmosphere, etc. so this is an informative, but basic, tool to help you in your plans. The quality of film, sound, and color is superb, as always. She gives her lessons slow enough to take notes, but still with enough information that you feel you have a good hold of the subject. This is a wonderful choice for the basics of wedding planning, or even for a fancy party. Congratulations on one of the happiest days of your lives!!
