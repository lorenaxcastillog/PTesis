 These workouts are so good in the respect that they don't allow you any excuses. EVERYONE can find 10 minutes - and more often than not, after the first 10 minutes you find the energy to turn that into 20 or 30 minutes. This workout is a little more fast paced than other Pilates dvds I've done, but it still uses the classic moves. As usual, each 10 minute routine focuses on a specific body part (first is buns/thighs, second is arms/shoulders, third abs, fourth a total toning and lastly a stretch). The instructor Lara Hudson, is a good cuer and so you know what's coming up next and are always prepared. They do use weights so you should have some nearby. I love this dvd. I've only done it once through once, because I just got it, but I intend to use it about twice a week along with the other workouts of theirs. It's easy to get through because of the time and it's fun and different. I recommend it for sure
