 Wildland fire air-attack pilot dies in an airplane explosion and is dispatched back to earth by an angel to mentor a rookie pilot. Pete (Richard Dreyfuss)is the spiritual coach and he is not entirely confident about his mission, but he gives it a try and soon gets more than he bargained for when the girlfriend (Holly Hunter) he left behind begins to fall in love with his student. Pete tries to derail the affair with his angelic power, but instead learns about true love when his girlfriend contemplates death in a suicidal air mission to rescue smokejumpers trapped by a massive wildland fire. This is one of Steven Spielbergs's more humble movies, a contemporary remake of "A Guy Named Joe," and it is a charming and humorous story. John Goodman is Pete's lovable best friend as the air-attack school commander, and Audrey Hepburn has a very nice role as Pete's supervisory angel. The movie features a beautiful backdrop of forest wilderness with wildland fires combatted by smokejumpers and World War II-era attack bombers
