 The redemption sometimes implies to clean up the mess of a dark past. An abnegate father of family will receive the unexpected visit of some guys of the underworld who identify with another name. The story is clearly exposed in three movements; in the first we will witnesses the existential parallelism between his violent response to the first sudden incursion in his grocery and the way his own son reacts against the violence of a teenager who really disturbs him twice before the hidden rage; the second movement is the unmasking fact about his real identity before his wife and his son and finally the conclusion, the final solution. The progressive psychological deconstruction and psychological reconstruction obeys to a necessity of self redemption. Original treatment of David Cronenberg, whose stylistic approaches respect the dark corners of the human behavior, makes of him the closest filmmaker to David Lynch. A solid script supported by excellent performances, although I must admit William Hurt (this unexplainably underestimated actor) stole the show in the last fifteen minutes of the story. Totally recommended
