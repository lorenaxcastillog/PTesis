 Whenever someone asks me what the weirdest movie I've ever seen is, I always mention Eraserhead. I'm proud to say that Eraserhead is one of my all time favorite movies. Everything about it is dream like, nightmarish, and surreal, making it one of the most unique experiences one will ever encounter in cinema. Eraserhead's content and story can't be explained with words. You must see it to really understand it. Basically it revolves around a paranoid man in a decaying industrial world who discovers he is the father to a hideous mutant baby. Like David Lynch's other films, there is no official explanation to Eraserhead. It is up to the audience to figure out what all of the symbolism means. Eraserhead isn't for everyone. It is easily the weirdest movie ever made, and it can be disturbing to certain viewers. However, the artistic quality is great, and the surrealism makes it unlike any other movie. Bottom line, whether you love it or hate it, Eraserhead is definately worth viewing. The meaning behind it is up to the viewer to decide.
