 I was into the concept, the idea that memories which you no longer wish to keep can be permanently erased from your mind. Unfortunately, by the time these scenes were shown I was sick and tired of the various characters. They were whiney, boring, combative, and very profane.(The R rating is well deserved). At times I felt I would have very pleased if the entire cast(almost) had been rolled by a beer truck--at least then the misery I was feeling at having to watch these neurotic n'er-do-wells would be over. It didn't happen and some masochistic urge forced me to watch to the end. To be fair, there was one enjoyable area. The tenacity and will of the Jim Carrey character in refusing to let go of the memory of the Kate Winslet character, along with some nice special effects as this played out. Also, the ending would have been very compelling--if only I could have cared! I didn't. This should have been an excellent movie, but wasn't. Pity
