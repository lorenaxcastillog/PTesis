 In the 1960's, there was Bond, James Bond. Then there was the Man from U.N.C.L.E, Wild Wild West and Our Man Flint...and the biggest Poke in the eye to Bond, Matt Helm. Dean Martin did four Matt Helm films. These films were all tongue and cheek, all done for laughes..always poking the spy genre in the eye. These four films in this collection have action with so much comedy twists. If you want humor with a 60's bent, this is it. Martin slick Helm is fun to watch. He essays the Helm role with a girl in his bed, a martini and satire humor (One film the girl is listening to Frank Sinatra-Martin deadpans "You like Perry Como?"). These are cute thrillers will no real substance, but you dont go to an Austin Powers movies for a real mystery either. This is spy fluff that is funny and filling. Worth ten stars, but they only allow me five Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
