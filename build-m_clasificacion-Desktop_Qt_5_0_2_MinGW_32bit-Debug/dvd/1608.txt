 With a name like "Tokyo Godfathers" I didn't know what to expect from this movie (for all I knew this was an adaptation of the american movie "The Godfather" hehehe). But I decided to give it a chance and see why this movie had gotten 3 stars (when it was out in the movie theaters). By the end, I felt like I had to watch it again, it was great. The visuals were fine, the story was intriguing, and overall I highly enjoyed it. The mix of comedy, seriousness, and touching emotions were put at just the right moments in the story that it just blended so well and helped to draw you into what was going on. You won't find the big-eyed, super power, or robo tech type of animation here, which is popular with anime. This movie is done in a more realistic style. So if you are looking for that other style, I don't know how much you'll enjoy this movie. But if you are not bothered by more realistic drawings/stories, or willing to keep an open mind, I think you'll find a winner here
