 I am so excited to now own this fabulous movie on DVD!! I remember watching it on tv when I was a little girl and my mom taped it. We would watch that movie all the time! My brother and I would recite lines to each other from our favorite parts. My absolute favorite part is when Carrol Channing enters as the White Queen and sings her "Jam Tomorrow, Jam Yesterday, But never ever jam today" song! Then when she pricks her finger and says she's better, much better, beeetttter and turns into a goat! We would crack up every single time. Unfortunately the VHS was taped over so we only had our memories of it, until now! I've already watched the DVD once and I am going to bring it to my parent's house to watch it with my mom! This is definitely the best version out there and a must see! You'll fall in love with it!
