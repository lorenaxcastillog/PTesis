 I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed. This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint. If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it. And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him. He is a very good actor and an underated one at that. So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure. And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!
