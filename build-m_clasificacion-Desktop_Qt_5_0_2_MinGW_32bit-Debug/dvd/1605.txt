 Neil Peart is tired. He gave us great music and influential drumming for decades. This DVD is boring and looks more like what a kid does in his bedroom when he is just screwing around after school. Peart deserves the credit he gets for performances on albums like Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Exit Stage Left..., Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and those tours. But in my personal opinion the man has nothing left in the tank. I have seen this solo done in various presentations since the Hold Your Fire tour. Nothing changes tour to tour with the exception of the same parts being rearranged. So if you want to spend an afternoon watching a guy warm up and going out of his way to do nothing then this is your dream package. If you want to be inspired by drummers who go out of their way to bring something exciting, new, fresh, and truly goes to the max with his playing...then I suggest you look elsewhere
