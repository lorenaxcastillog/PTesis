 I have to say that Memento is the best movie I've ever seen. I decided to watch this because it's by the same director and I was wondering what else he could come up with. And I wasn't dissapointed. The movie is in black and white and jumps around the timeline in an interesting way, which keeps you focused and trying to figure out what's going on. I thought the general idea of the movie, about a guy who follows and watches random people, trying to figure out who they are and what they do, is quite original but at the same time common to everybody -- who hasn't wondered about the random person on the street (I sure have). The way the movie is presented is involving and at times humorous. The way the camera is positioned you really get a feel for being right there, next to the characters and involved in the storyline. The movie is just as good on the second or third viewing (like Memento), and that's definitely evidence to the fact it's good. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who liked Memento; you won't be dissapointed with it.
