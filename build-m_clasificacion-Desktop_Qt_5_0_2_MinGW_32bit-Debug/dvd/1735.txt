 Carole Lombard and John Barrymore are at their best in this screwball comedy. Broadway producer Barrymore "discovers" Lombard working in a department store and makes her a star actress (and his mistress). But they bicker all the time and Lombard decides to go to Hollywood: she wants to be in pictures. Later when the two coincidentally occupy the same Twentieth Century Limited train from Chicago to New York, well, it becomes the wackiest train ride until Preston Sturges put Claudette Colbert and the Ale & Quail Club aboard a similar train to Florida in THE PALM BEACH STORY. The pace of the movie is lightning fast, and the yelling back and forth combined with the moments of fleeting tenderness is hilarious. The train is also filled with other weird characters, including a religious fanatic with delusions of wealth and two bearded guys who hope to get into one of Barrymore's plays. But Barrymore has his ways, and when the train rolls into Grand Central, Lombard has inked the contract he wanted from her. Great fun to watch - a classic
