 Why do "reviewers" of Woody Allen always have to qualify their praise with something lame like "not his best, but...". It sucks! This move is as good as any Woody Allen movie I've ever seen, and that's saying a hell of a lot, and I've seen a hell of a lot of them. Own a lot too. This movie was colorful, funny, filled with fascinating characters, had more plot twists that a dog's hind leg, and the perfect ending. It was as original as anything could possibly be. I won't give away any of the plot, I'll leave that to the clods who have nothing else to say about the picture. Woody Allen is not in this movie, that disappointed me the first time I saw it, but now that I've seen it again, I don't mind. It was great. Though as a rule I prefer his movies with him in them. Also the movie had substance and structure. It was well-constructed and moved fast. I liked it a lot. Note: pay attention to the background music (songs actually) at significant events in the flick. I highly recommend it.
