 Robin Williams is one of those rare super successful comedians who can take a barebones script and fill it with all sorts of fun-ness, hilarity, and jovialocularity that soon, the barebones script transforms into a morbidly obese, oddly smelling dude who rings your doorbell at dinnertime on a weeknight and offers to cut your grass "for $10 less than the guy who's doing it now." Patch Adams is almost the perfect Robin Williams vehicle. A more perfect vehicle for Robin would be some sort of school bus with him way in the back and a bunch of fabulous guys (pharmacuetical sales, commercial real estate or possibly children talent agents) talking on their cell phones and admiring their platinum bracelets that look so good with their slicked back hair. You know what I'm talking about. Well, that vehicle is driven by some sort of small monkey on a mountainous highway. And instead of paying attention to the road, the monkey is distracted by the glare of all the platinum bracelets and plunges into the Caspian Sea and all are lost. To me, that is the perfect vehicle for Robin Williams.
