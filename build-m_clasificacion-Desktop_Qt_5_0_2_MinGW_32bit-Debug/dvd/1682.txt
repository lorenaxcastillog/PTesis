 Wow! Just wow! I am impressed with this one. I was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when I first heard about this one, seeing how I normally associate Tim Meadows, with flat, not very funny, comedies, when he stars, and very vague cameo and side roles in other Adam Sandler and Will Ferrel main Headliner movies! But this one, wow! He is really a talented individual! I shouldn't be so quick to judge though. His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark. I also like how this movie, once again paired up Nick Nolte and Mr. Meadows, for the first time since 48 Hours! Nothing short of brilliance, I say! While Mr. Meadow's role was much more dramatic in Hotel Rwanda, keep in mind, he did show a sufficient amount of that "angry black" character he is famous for in 48 Hours. Definitely pick up this movie! You won't be sorry! MC White said: You'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up, and memorize all of the Main Character's names! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!
