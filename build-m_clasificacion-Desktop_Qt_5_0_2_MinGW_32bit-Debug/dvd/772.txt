 As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, I really wanted to like this film. I enjoyed them in Kiss The Girls, and I expected another interesting film. Their performances were the only bright spot, but they couldn't rescue this movie. This film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream. There was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible. As many other reviewers noted (I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces), it was so very predictable. I rented 2 films yesterday, and I had trouble watching both of them, for very different reasons. The other film was "Monster", starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci. I almost couldn't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and I forgot that it was a movie. It absolutely is a gripping story, and Ms. Theron richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she received for it. Conversely, I almost couldn't watch High Crimes because it was so ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
