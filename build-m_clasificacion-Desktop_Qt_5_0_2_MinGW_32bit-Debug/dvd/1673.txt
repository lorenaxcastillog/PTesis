 Usually you look back at old programs like the Lone Ranger and think how hokey they were. Then you realize that you, being a kid at the time could enjoy them as they were. Then there is "Topper" the TV show. It was one big smoking commercial. Well I sort of counted on this happening with "My Little Margie" (Gale Storm.) Boy was I surprised. The plots are complex for the small period of time they have to execute in. Hokey or not they had me laughing. And Price per pound, you get so many episodes. I am working my way through them all and find some how they are comforting like an old friend. It is fun t spot the different actors in movies and say I saw that person on "My Little Margie." After viewing, I will put them on the shelf and they look good as a collection.
