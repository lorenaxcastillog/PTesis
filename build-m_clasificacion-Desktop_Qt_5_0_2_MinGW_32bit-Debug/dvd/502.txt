 Keli Roberts is quickly surpassing Kathy Smith for me as my favorite video aerobics instructor. I do her 10 Minute Solution Kickbox regularly; and now this one is also going to be a steady routine in my workouts. This is a great mix of cardio and weights. It is similar to Kathy Smith's Fat Burning Breakthrough, except that there is more emphasis on strength training than step cardio. Since I am working on building up muscle and metabolism, that makes this video more suited for my needs. My back, arms and thighs were very sore after this, which was a good thing because I am not as challenged these days as I would like to be. The step combinations are probably challenging. I've taken my share of step/dance classes, so these weren't a big deal for me, but I could see how someone less experienced would be thrown for a loop. My advice is keep at it and you'll get it. I suspect the overall combo of cardio and weights will pay off in the end
