 When I'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should, the temperature is near 100, and the U. S. casualties from the War In Iraq now have reached over 2,500-- the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else--STRICTLY BALLROOM is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile. Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys. In addition to the fine performances by Mercurio and Morice, the other actors are quite wonderful, particularly the Hasting parents. Golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound, as does delicious humor. Leave it to the Aussies to do everything right in a movie.
