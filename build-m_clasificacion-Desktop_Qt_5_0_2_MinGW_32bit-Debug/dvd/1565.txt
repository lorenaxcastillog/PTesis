 This was a story which I had read as a child, and, unfortunately, forgotten about. Someone recently mentioned it, and I could only recall something about a Toad and a motor-car. I also remembered that I had very much enjoyed reading about the Toad and the motor-car when I was younger, so I decided to re-read it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I not only still enjoyed the Toad and and the motor-car, but also his friends, Rat, Mole, and Badger, which I had previosly forgotten. Grahame strangely mixes animal life with human life, but he pulls it off very well, and produces an extraordinary land where animals and humans co-exist as (mostly) equals, almost like in C.S. Lewis' Narnian Chronicles , but not quite, since the animals wear clothes. It actually very much reminded me of C. S. Lewis' very obscure work, Boxen, which he created as a child. A land where animals wore suits and lived as humans. Grahame's is, of course, far better, and is a joy to read for both young and old. I highly recommend this book
