 It gets harder and harder to watch this movie, especially the young Paul Newman's final screed on the death of Karen (relax, Butch! Jill Haworth's only pretending to the dead!). As a document of the transition from Gandhi's hunger strike, intended to embarass the British into behaving decently, to the Irgun's ruthless bombing of the King David Hotel, intended to bloody the British into leaving Israel alone and unprotected in the exact middle of her traditional blood enemies (Arabs? what Arabs?), it's informative. The movie barely scratches the surface of hatreds that have festered in the Middle East for millenia, and the glossy Hollywood overcoat has peeled away from the history over the years, but as a faithful reflection of a naivete we Americans will have to overcome to have any hope of surviving nuclear armageddon on Ariel Sharon's cattle ranch, it's pretty good. In today's hip-hop world, Sal Mineo's deep dark secret that he was raped by Nazis in Dachau seems laughable -- these days, you can hear that kind of gangsta rap from the Toyota next to you at a red light. As a call to menschlichkeit in a harsh world, 4 stars
