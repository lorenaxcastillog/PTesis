 For those or you who are griping that this DVD is not Cesar Millan, you should learn something. Paul Owens is the ORIGINAL dog whisperer. He wrote the book, The Dog Whisperer, long before Cesar was in business! Paul Owens is a highly-educated animal behaviorist who knows how to correctly communicate with a dog - without techniques like hanging, rolling, choking, e-collars, leash pops, choke chains, hand bites or foot corrections. If you purchased this DVD thinking it was Cesar, you should have looked at the name of the author! Someone should explain copyright infringement to Cesar and National Geographic for using the name The Dog Whisperer when it properly belonged to Paul Owens. This is an EXCELLENT DVD and shows you how to work with your dog with respectful techniques - no need for force, fear or intimidation techniques. These techniques work - I use them with my own dogs as well as the dogs I instruct. Paul Owens' techniques work as fast as people think that Cesar's techniques work ... they last longer ... they work with the dog's natural state ... and they are pleasant for the owners to use
