 Whether you're drawn to suave action heroes tossing out wry quips while emptying machine-guns into charging hoards, or of nearly wordless, hours-long existential explorations of meaningfulness and nothingness, "I'm Not Scared" will likely find in you a delighted new fan. For the subtitle-phobic: take a risk! "I'm Not Scared" is refreshingly original, quietly chilling, and continually surprising to the end. The cast, led by 10 year-old Guiseppe Cristiano, is uniformly solid, and the Oscar-caliber photography is nothing short of brilliant. The smart, effective score never gets overly dramatic nor does it tip the audience as to how it's "supposed" to feel. Its quiet beauty merely serves to support and bind the elements of the story, while standing humbly in the background. I discovered this film quite by accident, having read no reviews, and now consider it to be my "find" of the year. I recommend "I'm Not Scared" without reserve or hesitation to anyone who ever wondered what his or her parents really did to make their money
