 STRANGERS WITH CANDY is one of my favorite shows. Why have they stopped making it? Although good, SEASON TWO is the weakest link out of the three seasons. This is mainly due to a two part episode that involved Jerry joining an annoying cult. I could have done without those two episodes, but thats just me, I have to say out of 30 episodes in all those two were the only ones I didn't care for. With a running time of 4 hours and 33 minutes, SEASON 2 has 10 episodes: 1. Yes You Can't, 2. Behind Blank Eyes, 3. The Virgin Jerri, 4. The Goodbye Guy, 5. Hit And Run, 6. The Blank Page, 7. To Love, Honor, And Pretend, 8. The Blank Stare part 1, 9. The Blank Stare part 2, 10. (season finale) A Price To High For Riches. "Strangers With Candy" is very original and features one of the finest and funniest cast of characters ever. The cast features: Amy Sadaris, Paul Dinello, and Stephen Colbert. The show may have been short lived on ~Comedy Central~ but it will always live on in the hearts of a legion of devoted fans.
