 This is the most horrible documentary I've ever watched. The narrator's tone is dreadful (sounds as if the DVD were made for children) and the re-enactments are torturous. There are some high points, snips of interviews from Johnny and others, but there is very little performance, beyond what I assume would be "fair use." Further, this DVD really doesn't add anything, nor does it shed any new light on Johnny Cash. The A&E Biography DVD is far more enriching. Edit: I feel I really need to protect people from this product. First, many of the interviews are found on other products. Second, the packaging is painfully misleading. It suggests it has never-released concert footage of the Nixon concert. I couldn't find it apart from a few seconds of footage. Third, it's just plain boring. I've read the biographies, I'm not looking for a feel-good documentary, but I'm also not looking for a get-bored documentary. If you're just going to repeat what others have said, what's the point. If I could give it zero stars, I would
