 This is a perfect western and also one of the last of that genre for a long time. "Once Upon a Time in the West" has cinematography that is brilliant. The environmental shots add to the plot and there is a slow build up until the unnervingly ultraviolent climax. Each scene fits in a post modern apocolyptic take on law and justice in the western genre. Auteurs had always had a fascination with westerns (such as Jean Luc Godard with Johnny Guitar) but "Once Upon a Time in the West" obviously was mined for great effect by Quentin Tarantino (consider both Kill Bill movies) and other aficenados. Without elaborate special effects or hip irony, a story about corruption and murder is revealed scene by scene in this cinematic masterpiece. And with Dario Argento credited for the "screen story" you could tell great minds were at work in putting this together
