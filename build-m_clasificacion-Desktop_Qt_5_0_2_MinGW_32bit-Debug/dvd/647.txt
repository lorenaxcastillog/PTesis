 They say that art reflects society and it is no wonder that Bush is president and the whole world has gone mad killing each other over religion when movies like Two Days are made. The film is the worst i have ever seen by far, a motiveless paul rudd who gives a terrible performance tries to convince us that he wants to kill himself cause he cant get work as an actor in sunny LA and afford a BMW, this in itself is a flawed idea but trust me when i tell you it sinks lower than dolly partons [...] as the story, or lack there off, unfolds. No real characters, just cliche's, absolutely no direction whatsoever, nothing is achieved visually just a bunch of talking heads that fail to convince us of anything else except what fools we were for watching this film. By the end of it i wanted to kill myself in couldnt wait two days!!! Who made this film????
