 What happened in the 2000 election was a travesty of momumental proportions. It is the stuff that usually is found in fiction novels but it happened right here in the USA; the country that proportedly sets the standard for Liberty and Democracy in the world. Unfortunately, our election process has been corrupted and this film shows how it happened. It is a shame that some people I have talked to admit that although it is most possible and probable that the fix was in, we are still better off with the person who won the presidency, so, no harm, no foul; nevermind there was wrongdoing and illegal practices. If we don't demand a paper trail in the next election I think it will cause so much disinfrancisement that the percentage of voters showing up at the polls will fall even more. After the last two elections I have no faith and believe we need to call in election observers from foreign countries. This film is a must see and will open some eyes as it is backed up by a lot of compelling evidence
