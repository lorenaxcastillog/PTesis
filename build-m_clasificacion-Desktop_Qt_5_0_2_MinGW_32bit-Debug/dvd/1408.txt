 I may have once considered this movie to be somehow romantic, like so many other reviewers. But, that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that I thought were happy and stable. However, after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter. Now I have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost. I was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger, happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters - can they ever really be content with their spouses? It's a sad reflection on the human condition. Yes, bitter sweet indeed
