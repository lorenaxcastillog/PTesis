 Of all of the Baby Einstein's my grandson loves Galileo the best, and has not tired of since first enjoying it at around 8 months. When he watches he looks back and forth from the video to me with a huge smile and look of wonder, giving us a great opportunity to bond and learn. The little kangaroo kid is so funny and makes little noises rather than words to express himself and his mommy is so loving, always there for a hug or reassurance! The 'plot' is well played out, moving through different areas of sky explorations. The photography is absolutely stunning and the music is perfect for a young child. I can't recommend this video enough. To this day, my grandson is thrilled when he hears "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" (making a star twinkle with his hands) and can even pick this song out when it is revised or used with different words.
