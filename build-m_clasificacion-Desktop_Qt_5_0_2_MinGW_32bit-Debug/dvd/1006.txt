 Batman, like the Phoenix, has risen from the ashes and has returned with 'Batman Begins'. This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time. Christian Bale has taken Batman and made it his own. I didn't think anyone could top Michael Keaton's performance as the dark knight, but I was wrong. The entire film in itself is truly unbelievable. I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie. Let's not forget the locations that we see in this movie. All truly breath taking. Batman fans rejoice! This is a movie that is not something you should miss. Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie. One of the best movies of last year.
