 After spending his entire life focused on his theological studies, Dietrich Bonhoeffer met and (and much to his surprise) fell in love Maria von Wedemeyer, the grand-daughter of one of his greatest supporters in the Confessing Church. They became engaged just prior to his arrest and imprisonment. For the two years that Bonhoeffer was in prison prior to his execution, he and Maria carried on a fascinating and beautiful correspondence. These letters were published a few years ago by Maria's sister, Ruth-Alice von Wedemeyer and Ulrich Kabitz, as "Love Letters from Cell 92". I cannot recommend this book enough to those interested in seeing a very different side (yet really not that different) of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. I had always been fascinated and deeply moved by Bonhoeffer the theologian, but it was wonderful to see this other side to him as well, that of a complex man of God sincerely in love with a complex young woman
