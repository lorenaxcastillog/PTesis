 I used to love this Peter Weir movie and now sadly it seems far too idealistic and implausible to me. I wish it didn't. I've probably seen Dead Poet's Society a dozen times and while I still think it is a beautiful motion picture in its message about how the power of the written word as a tool for free thought is a life-changing force, I can't seem to find it in me to think it's possible that a teacher could have reached teenaged boys in quite that way. Well, I guess that's why we have films, so we can see things we wouldn't in life. All this said, I do believe Dead Poet's Society is a classic. If you haven't seen it, you probably should. It is an uplifting, often gloriously beautiful, always embraceable film with a solid cast that includes Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and living theatrical legend, Norman Lloyd.
