 Get Real is a story of young love and accepting who you are. Steve (Ben Silverstone)is gay and comfortable with it, even though he is only out to his neighbor, Linda (Charlotte Brittain). Because he is afraid that the boys at school will abuse him even more if they know he's gay, Steve's relationships consist of one-night stands with guys he meets in the park. This is how he meets the local big-man-on-campus, John (Brad Gorton). This film portrays high school 'society' very realistically and the interactions between the characters is very genuine. Get Real includes the awkward silences, the social fumblings, the excitement of a first love, and the heartbreak that everyone, gay or straight, went through in high school. All of the actors deserve high marks for their performances, especially Silverstone and Gorton. The scenes after the dance and after the awards ceremony are so honest and raw that they break my heart every time. Their frank portrayals are what make this unassuming little film one that everyone needs in their collection
