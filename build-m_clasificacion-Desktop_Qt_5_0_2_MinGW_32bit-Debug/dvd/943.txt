 This can by no means claim to be a perfect depiction of the biblical story of King David but it is by no means a lost cause either. It is a pretty fair little drama. Some license has been taken with the scriptural story but it is more faithful than most film adaptations. It is also a pretty good movie. This film tells the story of King David, the successor to King Saul and the founder of the Davidic line. It begins by showing Saul's disobedience and goes from there to David's anointing as king. Even so, David will not lift his hand against Saul who is also an anointed king. The film demonstrates David's strengths as well as his weaknesses. He was a good man after God' own heart but he was by no means perfect. He pays for that imperfection. This film is NOT the place to learn scripture but it does communicate the fundamentals of the story rather well and does so in a very viewable manner. It was enjoyable.
