 For Keeps where shall I start. For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network. Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film). The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant. They struggle to stay together. I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture. It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times. The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up. Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection
