 Season 3 of Arrested Development is an excellent end to an underappreciated series. While having fewer episodes in this season than the previous two, it is made up for by packing the episodes with even more jokes. There are the callbacks to previous seasons, little story lines are completed, new story lines are made and ended in humorous ways, and the over all story about Michael helping his family is finally concluded. In general, the style of an intricate story line and callbacks that were established the first two seasons are continued, and perhaps taken to the next level. An example would be the episode titled "Family Ties." To fully understand the little jokes, it helps to know who is in the cast for that episode. This is a must for any one who is a fan of the show, and for those who are not fans, they should check out the previous seasons to see what they are missing
