 In this scary movie. Mark's mum dies when he is about 10 years old and he goes to stay with his uncle, aunt and cousins for a fortnight while his dad goes on a business trip. He is also under psychiatric treatment because of the trauma of his mother's death. Mark innocently gets involved in Henry's evil plans to kill and maim for fun!! Henry gives the impression of being a little angel to his parents and uncle and only shows his darker side to Mark. He even tries to convince everyone that his evil ideas have come from Mark because of the traumatic loss of his mum. Mark fails to convince his father, his uncle, his aunt or his psychiatrist of the evil doings of Henry right up to the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you by telling you the outcome. A very enjoyable film that had me on the edge of my seat almost all through
