 John Mayer is an unassuming performer and awesome entertainer. I have viewed this DVD several times and realize he is totally engrossed in what he does best and that is making music. His guitar solos are reminiscent of great guitarists of the past and he shamelessly honors his favorites with notable riffs or complete cover songs. He is a likeable fellow in his commentaries and his sense of humor on this collection lets the listener know he hasn't let any of his popularity go to his head. He has the ability to poke fun at himself and in my opinion, he is living life right, by not taking things too seriously. He makes a point to shed light on his band mate's abilities, when it would be really easy to keep the focus on himself. He is not that way at all. I'd be surprised if you do not emerge a huge John Mayer fan by giving your eyes and ears this musical treat any given Thursday or for that matter any day that ends in "Y"
