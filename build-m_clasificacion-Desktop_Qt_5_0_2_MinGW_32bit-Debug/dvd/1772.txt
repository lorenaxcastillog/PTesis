 I copied and pasted the bottom of this from another reviewer here. I have not seen this DVD, but thanks to this person for not wasting my money. For some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do NOT GET IT! we fans do NOT want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd!! WHO, pray tell, when they are at a concert in person spends a bunch of time looking around the fans and not the show??? GET IT YET?? DOH! simple! Keep the cameras on the SHOW! and DONT change from one camera to another every 5 SECONDS! that pisses me off too to no end. learn this, watch Roger Waters DVD in the flesh, learn learn LEARN!!!!!!!!!! The concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although Ned O'Hanlon said in an @U2.com interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the Boston show. The spirit of the entire show is captured very well, shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm
