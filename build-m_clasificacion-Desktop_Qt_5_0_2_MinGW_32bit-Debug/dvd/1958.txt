 I was knocked over by this DVD! Some of the facts presented, especially about how the vast number of stars in our entire universe being necessary for our survival, nearly brought me to tears. God reveals himself to be more awesome with each year of scientific discovery, and I do not see any way in which the Bible is contradicted by it. The Hebrew word for day (yom), as I look in my concordance, has many meanings, including "a period of time", "time", "days", "lifetime", "course of time", etc. The seven "yom" creation, therefore, makes perfect sense in light of this. Jesus said the Kingdom of God was like a seed that grew to be a small shoot, and then a mature plant. It takes time. We can look at the singularity from which God grew the universe the same way - as a seed. Interestingly, as we learn in "Journey", the first thing emitted from the seed after the explosion was light. "Let there be light". Science merely explains what God gave to us in His Word, that up until now, had to be trusted on faith.
