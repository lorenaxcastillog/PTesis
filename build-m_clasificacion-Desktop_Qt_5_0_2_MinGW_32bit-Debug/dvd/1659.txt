 I have to say that I am a fan of Bill Murray's acting (over and beyond his comedic work), and I think that Rushmore and Lost in Translation were efforts that should secure him in the canon of great actors, but this film felt very misguided and took an awful turn at some point. Murray's soulful, silent stare was way too overused here, cheapening the times he used it quite well in other movies, and after he parts from his neighbor, who is a wonderful character and helped balance out Murray's doleful depression, the film just seems to bottom out and never seems to rise again. Jarmusch has had much success in the past in following very quiet, interior characters (_Dead Man_, _Ghost Dog_), but here he either overplayed his hand or forgot that what really made those other films work was counterbalance. Nobody and the French ice cream man are excellent counterweights in the other films to keep things from getting too dragged down, but in this movie, the counterweight is cut away from way too early, and this film suffers for that mistake.
