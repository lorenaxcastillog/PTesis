 because I had read the reviews about the poor-used quality some buyers had experienced. This dvd EXCEEDED my expectations. At 39yrs, I've lost 25 pounds and have been maintaining for the past 4 months. During the winter months I work-out with Leslie's 3-4mile walk videos. Summer is too busy and I enjoy the outside walking. BUT, I like to kick off my morning with her 30 minute walk/kick. Bgt walk/jog for variety. It's a more intense work-out than the walk/kick and I appreciate the elevated heart-rate. The time flew-by. Mary-Kay has gotten a bad rap in some of the reviews- she is fine and does the low impact correctly. Just b/c she kicks higher does not mean she is overshadowing Leslie. Personally, I like it when Leslie does not interact w/her assistants and just sticks to business. Much less chatter about sweat, mistakes, noses, and all that jazz vs her other dvds...but that's just personal preference. Workout is fantastic- dvd is worth every penny- so purchase and decide for yourself. Anything that motivates us to get our body moving is worth it
