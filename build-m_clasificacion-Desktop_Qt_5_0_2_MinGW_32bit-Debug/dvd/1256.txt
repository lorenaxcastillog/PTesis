 I worked out to Kathy Smith tapes regularly for a long time. That was before I let myself go 5 years ago and gained 35 awful pounds. Now, just starting out all over again at the age of 42, I could not keep up with the different types of steps being changed in this DVD and would have preferred it if she had stuck to a fewer number of moves a little longer, rather than having so many to learn/change so rapidly. I began cheating and just doing my favorties over and over before becoming too frustrated and stopping altogether. I would recommend the Sansone "Walking Away the Pounds" DVD's for those (like me) who are very out of shape and just starting out again. It has a lot of basic steps repeated, with varying arm movements to get your heart pumping and body conditioned for the more moderate DVD's like this one. However - I gave it 4 stars because of the menopausal informative sections and the great yoga section. Also, because I WILL someday again be able to keep up with her. But for the time being, this DVD is just too much
