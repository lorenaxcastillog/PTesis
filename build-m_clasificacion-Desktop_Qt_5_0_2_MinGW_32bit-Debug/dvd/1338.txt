 I've seen 4 Kylie Shows. This one makes the other 3 seem like nap time. This show is the best tour I have ever seen. It's flashy, but in an effortless way. Almost like this tour was more about ideas based on what Kylie wants more than what the audience would want. She starts out with a Moulin Rouge theme that is super flashy and glamorous. Next was the Disco Dive section. After that she has a Homo erotic men-together-in-the-locker-room theme that is perfect for preserving her gay appeal, (not to mention that the dancers are almost naked). She also has some Chicago influence and then comes the Space Age Kylie. Her singing is stronger than any of the actual tracks she has recorded. Then there is the set itself, it's amazing. There are many beautiful colors and pieces that go every which way. It is very nice. I would pick up this DVD as soon as you can
