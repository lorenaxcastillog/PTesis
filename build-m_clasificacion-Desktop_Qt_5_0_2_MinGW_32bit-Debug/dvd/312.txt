 The movie's plot is simplistic. Jack Crews (Swayze) and Earl (Randy Travis) must deliver a load of illegal weapons or the terrorists kill Jack's family. In addition, they must fend off Red (Meat Loaf), a fanatical, Bible verse- yelling madman, and his redneck thugs, who are attempting to steal the cargo. Anyone who enjoys explosions and big rigs will like this movie. Red's men try to hijack the guns several times, and each time their attempts fail, usually with some impressive crash. In fact, all of Red's crew are either blown up, splattered all over the pavement, or crushed within a truck cab. There are some good lines about how juice causes gas and what ATF really stands for. It's not the most intellectual movie out there, and Swayze's facial expression never does change, but with the number of explosions and huge trucks, who cares? In any event, you'll find out how deadly trucking really can be
