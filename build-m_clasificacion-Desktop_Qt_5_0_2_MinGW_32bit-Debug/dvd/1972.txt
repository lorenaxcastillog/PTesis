 It's a shame that "Homegrown" was but a brief blip on the box office radar screen, but it hardly ranks as the greatest injustice to befall a Hollywood product. This movie isn't a masterpiece. Still, it is thrilling, intriguing, funny, and provides a fascinating look at the subculture of marijuana growers. The performances seem spot-on, and the movie's creators have admirably avoided some common pitfalls: the growers aren't presented in a "Robin Hood" light, but neither are they demonized; the violence in the film is neither overstated nor glossed-over; and the ending, thankfully, isn't stock Hollywood. The film has a lot of creative integrity going for it. I do agree with another reviewer: this look into the growers' world whets the appetite for a look at the history of marijuana growing, and it would have been nice if the creative team behind the DVD had included such, even if only as a bonus feature
