 This 2000 release stars Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. As much as I enjoyed Pretty Woman, that performance doesn't compare to the excellent work Julia did portraying Erin Brockovich. Years ago, Albert Finney gave an excellent Tom Jones (classic movie, not the singer) portrayal. I'm a paralegal and relate strongly to this movie - all the research and paper processing, the concern for clients, the knuckle-biting waits hoping verdicts are delivered favorably. It's a true story making it even more interesting. Erin is a down-on-her-luck divorced mother of 3, just trying to make ends meet. She has a personal injury case after a vehicular accident, and is represented by the attorney who, after her case is lost at trial, becomes her boss (she kinda forces herself into his payroll). While working at the attorney's office, Erin happens upon the beginnings of a major class action suit against a water company that has been knowingly poisoning the residents of a town with chromium, a rust inhibitor. Nasty stuff, that chromium, when ingested. Will Erin and her boss persevere for their clients? The real-life Erin Brockovich plays a bit part in the movie - she's a waitress at a diner
