 This is the first of two Hardy Boys serials that originally appeared in "The Mickey Mouse Club". You will not get "The Mickey Mouse Club" on this DVD, just The Hardy Boys segments. In the mid 1990's the Disney Channel (cable tv) removed some of the MMC serials from the shows and created new half-hour shows of just those stories. New opening & closing titles were created for these new mini-series. The then-famous song "Gold Doubloons & Pieces of Eight" introduces you to "The Mystery Of Applegate's Treasure". A serialized story loosely based on the first Hardy Boys book "The Tower Treasure". Starring: Tim Considine (of Spin & Marty fame) as Frank Hardy. Tommy Kirk (Old Yeller & The Shaggy Dog) as Joe Hardy. Purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete, unedited, hour-long "Mickey Mouse Club" shows that these ran in, but fans will still enjoy these re-edited episodes
