 If you love your dog, and wish to truly earn his respect and trust, please resist the pull of the glamour and glitz of Mr. Milan's t.v. shows, and don't bother buying this book. His very basic premise of exercise, training and love remain the only idea I agree with as a trainer and behaviorist, myself. Mr. Milan ignores prevailing research by using his forceful "choke and drag" methods; these methods can create different problems ultimately. Compare this book to POSITIVE PERSPECTIVES: Love Your Dog, Train Your Dog, by Pat Miller. You will create well-behaved pets through a form of benign leadership, clear communication, love, and trust to form a willing relationship using Ms. Miller's methods. Patricia McConnell, PhD., and Karen London, PhD. have written many fabulous and informative books on training and behavioral issues such as THE CAUTIOUS CANINE, FEISTY FIDO, I'LL BE HOME SOON, WAY TO GO! and FEELING OUTNUMBERED? These books are short, easy to read and packed with lots of useful, realistic tips. If you truly love your dog--please stay away from this book
