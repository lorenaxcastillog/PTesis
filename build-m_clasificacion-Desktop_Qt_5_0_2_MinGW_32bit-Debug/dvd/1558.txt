 I recently saw a television preview of snippets from the "Marlon Brando screen test" included in the bonus features of this upcoming new DVD of Streetcar, and it looks to be fantastic. Apparently this is rediscovered footage not seen before. It includes Brando auditioning for "Rebel Without A Cause"(!) (- which of course eventually went to James Dean.) We see the talented and strikingly handsome young Brando, fresh faced and bright eyed, exuding charisma and presence, not yet famous (he gets quizzed about what stuff he has been in so far) but on the cusp of screen legend immortality. Nothing more needs be said about the film that has not been said already by previous reviewers. Suffice it that this is one of those definitively made films that it would be pointless folly for anyone to attempt to remake, as so indelibly is the role of Stanley Kowalski identified with Brando in a tour-de-force of acting, along with a great co-star and supporting cast. It is pleasing that this film is finally getting the handsome DVD treatment it deserves
