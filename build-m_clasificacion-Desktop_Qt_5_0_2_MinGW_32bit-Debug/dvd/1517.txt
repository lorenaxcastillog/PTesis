 It's rare in some of these action films for the lead actor to have also written the script, and it's even rarer when it comes out this well. Thomas Ian Griffith who plays the lead role of Terry McCain also wrote the script and served as the film's producer. He plays a sort of loose cannon cop who uses "excessive force" in trying to get the goods on mafia leader Burt Young (Rocky). When his partners Dylan (Tom Hodges) and Frankie (Candyman's Tony Todd) are killed in retribution, McCain finds himself a target. There's the usual dirty cop syndrome, but Griffith's script is tight and has some pretty good surprises along the way. Lance Henriksen plays soon to be police chief and Griffith's boss, and gives his usual sturdy performance. Charlotte Lewis appears as Anna, Griffith's estranged love interest, and James Earl Jones (Great White Hope) steps out of his Darth Vader shoes to play quite nicely Griffith's mentor and buddy. Director Jon Hess keeps the action moving nicely and there are some good kickboxing/fight sequences. All in all, a well done actioner, and probably should have been more noticed during its theatrical release
