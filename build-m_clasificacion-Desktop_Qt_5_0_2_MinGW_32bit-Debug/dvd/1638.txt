 Richard Donner's "Maverick" probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since Mel Brooks's "Blazin' Saddles". Based on the atypical 1960s television western starring James Garner, Mel Gibson does a great job taking over from Garner as the suave, debonair gambler Brett Maverick, en route to the World Series of Poker in Saint Louis, Missouri. He joins forces with a younger, ambitious gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), who is as sly as a fox, older U. S. marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and a sympathetic Indian pal (Graham Greene). Both Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are hysterically funny, giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers. Along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler (Alfred Molina) and a whole colorful assortment of other ill-mannered Wild West bad guys (Many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great Hollywood westerns, like James Coburn and Denver Pyle.). Donner does a fine job directing his cast, which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst Gibson, Foster and Garner is absolutely superb
