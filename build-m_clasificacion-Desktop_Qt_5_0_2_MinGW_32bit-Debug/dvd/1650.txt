 Gene Hackman and Mary Mastrantonio are great in this class action case involving Argo, a automobile manufacturer. In this case a car manufacturer tries to hide a defective wiring circuit that can cause a car to explode. Interesting that here Hackman is fighting for the little guy, while in "Runaway Jury" he was the corporate lawyer. I am glad they are finally releasing Class Action on DVD February 1, 2005. Why they didn't before that is beyond all of us familiar with the movie. Hackman and Mastrantonio play father and daughter. This accident case threatens to split them even further than they were because of her fathers devotion to his cause. Mastrantonio is remarkable as a daughter who can't forgive her father for hurting her mother. Great drama and some good court scenes make this well worth buying. Lawrence Fishburne is excellent as always. His performance as an attorney is superb. I picked this up for under seven dollars at the local brick and mortar. I highly recommend it
