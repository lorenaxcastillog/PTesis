 Firstly, I have admired Lisa Kudrow's work in everything I have ever seen her do in film and television, and this comical gem is no exception. In The Comeback I was always on Valarie's side, even though I dont think the vewier is supposed too. I assume it was written to make you feel embarassed for the character, and you are, but sometimes you feel sorry for her and wind up rooting for her in her quest to regain her sit com legend status I was really suprised by the quality of writing on the show and thought the the premature cancellation was unfair. However, how would they have been able to keep coming up with ideas for that kind of documentary style concept. But within the 13 episodes they were able to create and complete the character arcs and maintain through-line and pathos for Valarie. Overall I think the show was great while it lasted, and the emmy nominations should have cushioned the blow for being axed so early on.
