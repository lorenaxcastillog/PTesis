 This is good if you want something different. I enjoy this DVD though I find it more of a taxing than a challenging workout- it's more strength than cardio. The music, setting, and dancers are all great. One of the female ballet dancers is so incredibly flexible that it's motivating. It isn't an intimidating routine either. I have no real knowledge of ballet- I didn't buy Volume 1 because the reviews for Volume 2 seemed better, and I haven't done ballet since I was about 5 years old. I'm also not particularly coorinated but this didn't seem to be too much of a problem. There are moments where detailed instruction wouldn't have hurt and I definitely rewind it to try to figure out some movements. However, that just goes with the territory of ballet- it takes practice. Granted, the elegance of ballet comes with time so mostly I started out quite clumsily but it's coming together. Overall, a very good DVD. I would particularly recommend this to pilates/yoga types who want something new
