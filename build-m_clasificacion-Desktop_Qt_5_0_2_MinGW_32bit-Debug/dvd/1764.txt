 To begin with, this movie is not for the dim witted. it's not for the shallow people who go through life just scratching the surface of things. There is a deeper meaning to this movie than the majority of the population can catch on to. Every word, every movement, every scene has an underlying meaning and message. thats why it's a cult classic, and why it was so hard to find for so many years (until MGM picked it up on dvd thank you!!!!!). This is one of my fav. movies, i've seen it a hundred times, and each time i find something new in it. But as i said this movie is not for the dim witted, if you can't read between the lines, your gonna be lost. Also the only reason anyone below would compare this movie to pulp fiction is because in the beginning of the movie you learn the broad picture. But they use flashbacks and cut scenes to tell the story of the hostage situation, by showing specific scenes, while cutting in and out of the present and the past.
