 The episodes continue Samurai Jack's quest to return to the past and defeat evil super demon Aku, but what makes the series enjoyable is the different styles and how each story is told. Each of the characters has their own dynamic personalities that liven up each episode. One episode is told in a bug's life/ Alice in Wonderland Theme (excellent use of music to pace the story), another describes what goes into hagas, and the finale has biker go-bots as bullies with a Ned Fanders? type character helping Jack. There is also an episode that honors the 300 Spartans. Jack being the learning hero, learns new skills from different characters and goes out of his way to help those in need. He makes friends and comes to their assistance for it is the honorable way of the Samurai. Once the action starts flowing, the scenes move in the artist's own unique style. Each episode of the series seems to pull the view more and more into watching the series. The two disc set is very fun to watch and is presented as a quality product for the fans to enjoy.
