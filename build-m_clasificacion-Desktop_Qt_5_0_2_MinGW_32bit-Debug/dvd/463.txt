 I'm amazed at how many people actually think the movie is better than the series. This is by far the best representation of Ghost In The Shell. Its feel and content match then go deeper into the characters and plotlines in the TRUEST form of the original manga. Anyone who thinks that the move is the best version never read the manga. The movie is a personal take on things from its director instead of following the style and characterisations from the manga , which in a way was a shame but it creates its own style. This always happens when something is adapted from its original form to andother, except in S.A.C. where they actually captured the feel of the manga, much to my surprise. Read the manga, watch GITS SAC and 2nd Gig and ignore the movie and yu'll have a better experience with Ghost In The Shell than the movie alone can provide. Real GITS pureists have read the manga and will make th conection the the new material matches Shirow's vision. KM
