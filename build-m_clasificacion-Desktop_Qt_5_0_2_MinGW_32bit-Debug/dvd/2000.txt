 The whole family enjoyed this charming and funny 2000 mockumentary about the dog show world, culminating in the Mayflower Kennel Club show in Philadelphia (modeled after the Westminster Dog Show in New York). I watched it again with the commentary on and then watched the extra scenes, which I almost never sit still for on a DVD. The most remarkable part is that the dialogue is improvised by the actors--director (and star) Christopher Guest and co-writer (and star) Eugene Levy wrote the story. During the shooting, each scene was explained to the actors who then improvised the dialogue. The technique gives the "mockumentary" a very realistic feel. Comedian Fred Willard has an amazing part as the "dumb as a hammer" TV commentator, who in one scene quizzes the dog show's director on the relationship between Mayflower and Philadelphia (a no brainer, he calls it, but then goes on to report that Columbus didn't actually pilot the Mayflower into Philadelphia, but to somewhere in the West Indies). Catherine O'Hara and many other actors from improvisational troupes also do a great job. Highly recommended to dog lovers and others.
