 Although the show ran on TV 40-50 years ago, it is still one of the greatest Western TV-movie ever made. Not only because of great performances of Eric Flemming, Clint Eastwood, Paul Brenegar,... and guest stars; but also because of the theme and content of the incidents, where the morals, principles, humanly views of life are in focus. In some incidents the popular concept and understanding of the term "hero" is masterly challenged. Heroes are human beings too, and they can be wrong og make mistakes. We all do what we have to do; have to live with our mistakes and learn lessons from them to become a better human being. There is not a single episode in this box set collection, where one could not draw a useful conclusion out of the events and the way of handling them through the story. Some of the stories are actually based on real life events in the second half of 19th century in the US.
