 This is a good 114 minute DVD - the copy I have is Region Free and it is in the PAL picture format I would guess , judging by the sharpness of the picture . The lighting is good and the musicians all share the spotlight , musically and visually . I was lucky enough to see Robben and his band live in Melbourne and the line up was completely different , but he only seems to play with the best musicians , so anyone backing him will be more than good . This disc is for guitar fans , but it is also for those who like groovy , soulful and funky music . There are plenty of shots of his hands , if you want that . You can sit down and watch it or have it on in the background at a party perhaps . It would make a great CD too . Here's hoping he puts out an electric live album soon . If you are a fan , buy it . If you don't know much about Robben , this is a great sampler or introduction for you
