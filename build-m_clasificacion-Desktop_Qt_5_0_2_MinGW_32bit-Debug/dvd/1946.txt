 One word, cedar pole. oh shoot..that's too!!!!11 LOLz. Me and my buddies saw this on his sixteenth birthday party, it was the best movie for a sixteenth birthday party. We didn't get our lisence yet, so we watched it a bunch because there's cool car scenes. This movie was real good because it has one of the best actors, duane johnson aka THE ROCK. Even better than the acting, was the screenplay. THE ROCK WROTE THE WHOLE MOVIE HIMSELF!!! That just blows me away. In the special features DVD when I bought a few there was a scene about the making of the movie, he said he wanted to get naked guys in teh forest, lol~~. Anyway I recomend this movie to anyone who likes movies and action in movies and funny guy Johnny Knoxvilll! I like the seen when he pulls the guy over I hope the Rock doesn't break my taillight too when I get my Porsh. *don't watch this movie if you like ice cream, because after you see the climax of the movie, you'll never want ice cream again!
