 I remember the first time I saw the preview for this series and not being able to wait in anticipation for it to reach the stores. Well it's now beyond the half-way point of Samurai Champloo and I can safely say that series lived up to all the anticipation. Case in point? Well the episode about graffiti tagging mentioned in the Amazon review is absolutely perfect when it comes to exemplifying what this show has to offer its viewers in terms of adventure, humour, and a sense of play when it comes to historical fact. The music is incredible and it amazingly seems to fit right into the setting of the show despite the centuries of time difference. Bottom line: we are getting closer to finding out about Fuu's quarry and coming to a conclusion to this story. That's a pity because it's not that often a series comes along that succeeds in so many aspects
