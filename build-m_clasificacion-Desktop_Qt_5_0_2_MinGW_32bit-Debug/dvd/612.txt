 Season 3 of this show is even better than the first two seasons. This is a show about a community -- the kids, the parents, and how everyone interact. The actors playing the various people in this show do a great job of making you either love them or hate them, and that is the mark of good acting. This is an addictive show that really plays on your emotions. It's not some overly dramatic soap-opera, but it's not a bubble-gum weekly like 90210 either. It's just the right amount of drama stirred up with a healthy dose of emotional impact. I genuinely recommend this show to anyone who enjoys beautiful people in dramatic situations, and this disc set comes with some fun bonus features as well: The Bonus Features are * Making of The Subways music video * What's In a Name? * From Script to Screen - The Party Favor * Gag Reel * Pass The Remote - Scene surfing commentar
