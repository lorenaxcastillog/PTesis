 I bought this DVD because I remember liking this new version beter than any episode of the last 3 seasons, and they don't air reruns on Boomerang. Let me tell ya, it's worth the money. The costumes of both the villians and the heroes look way better than they did in those older episodes. The episodes are way more actiony, and that's a good thing for an action lover, like myself. Plus, there's one crossover episode called "Girl's Night Out", where Super Girl and Batgirl team up to defeat Livewire, Poison Ivy & Harly Quin. Some of the best episodes are: -Sins of the Father -Double Talk -Never Fear -Joker's Millions -Old Wounds -Legends of the Dark Knight -Beware the Creeper -Judgement Day Special features include: -Commentary -Interactive Arkham Asylum -Languages & subtitles On the downside, there's too many episodes with Batgirl. That's the only downside I can think of. This product gets a 4/5. Kudos to WB.
