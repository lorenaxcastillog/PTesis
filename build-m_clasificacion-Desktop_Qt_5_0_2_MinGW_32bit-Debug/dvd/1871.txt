 Most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but I wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is. I am a long time U2 fan and had seen Rattle and Hum, but didn't get around to purchasing the DVD until late 2005. The fact that the music is wonderful is a given, but the cinematography is just astounding. I love how you get to see everything from every point of view. You get to see what the band sees on and around the stage, including the breathtaking sea of fans. You get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes. You get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on. And of course you get the passionate music. The film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to. I couldn't ask for more
