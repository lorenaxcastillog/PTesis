 I don't know how italians do it, but atmosphere in their movies is totally different from all others. Only an italian could do such a masterpiece as "The Church". If you remember the last minutes if Soavi's "Stage fright" when the murderer is sitting on stage and feathers are flying all around, if you liked those dreamy-like sequences in "The Sect", you'll get the understanding what "The Church" is like. It's beautifully shot, it's mysterious and gory, it's majestic. Definately pertain to the top 10 of the best italian horror films. If you liked previous works of Soavi, you'll love "The Church" 'cos it's much better and mature. I think it's the first movie of Michele Soavi where he truly demonstrated all his talent. Later he'd create "Dellamorte Dellamore" - a real jewel among all the world's greatest films. Dario Argento, Franco Ferrini, Lamberto Bava, Mario and Vittorio Cecchi Gori had their hands in "The Church". I guess their opinion is rather convincing. "The Church" is a true milestone on the not-so-long road of horror.
