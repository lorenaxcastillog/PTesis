 This a very interesting and clear insight into personal achievement as a true team player. This video is a wonderful gift for a child to give them inspiration and motiviation to do whatever they want to do. The narration really tells the story... &quot;We're not special people, what we do is special.&quot; ... &quot;If on the first try you don't succeed it's not a failure, just a set back.&quot; All of the Blue Angels are volunteers and make tremedous personal sacrifices by being &quot;on the road&quot; almost 200 days a year, for 2 year stint! All of the Blue Angels must agree together before any changes or decisions effecting the team are made. The Blue Angel pilots are the only pilots who do not perform a pre-flight inspection of their airplanes before flying, a very necessary and critical task for all pilots... the Blue's jump in and go, they have total trust in their airplane captains and ground crews, the absolute epitomy of team-work. An absolutely wonderful message for everyone, especially for those youngsters in your life
