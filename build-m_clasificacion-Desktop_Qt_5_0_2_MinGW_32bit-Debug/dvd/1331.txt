 Finding a film that achieves warmth, sweetness, tenderness, and child-like wonder while eschewing nostalgia, cuteness, and other heart-tugging manipulations is a rare treat. I can't think of a movie that walks this thin line better than The Children of Heaven. Losing a pair of shoes is the parti for a gentle and humorous adventure in which siblings act out of uncomplicated love for each other. Seeing them running through the streets of Tehran I felt privvy to a view of children that I might get if I were invisible, so spontaneous is their acting. I'm left supposing that director Majidi set the scenes and waited patiently for the kids to just PLAY. The pacing is natural and unhurried, the storyline is believable but tinted with a slight forgivable haze of allegory, and all is suffused with a heavenly sense of the lightness of being a child. Moments of adult anxiety enter here and there, and are central to the broad view of the plot, but mostly the movie is a series of intimate vignettes that culminate in a surprisingly tense footrace. I enthusiastically recommend this for the whole family.
