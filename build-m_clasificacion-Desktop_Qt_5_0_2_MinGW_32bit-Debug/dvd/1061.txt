 It's only docked a star for it's lack of an outside perspective. It's important to have a grasp of what else was happening in music during the 60's to fully comprehend the Beatles impact. That's missing here. Quibbles aside, there's a wealth of vintage clips that put all those bootleg videos and DVD's to shame. Worth it for THIS alone. The McCartney Grudge: To the reviewer below who believed that McCartney ordered the press conference and interview clips edited in such a way as to take the focus off John...well...you're wrong. 60's era press conferences were fairly tedious (most of the questions about how much money the band is making) and rock journalism did'nt come into vogue until the late 60's. I have hundreds of unedited 63-66 era interviews with the Beatles and Paul is almost ALWAYS the focus because John really did'nt have any interest in press conferences. Lennon himself gleefully admits this in a number of later interviews calling Paul " a great PR man...probably the best in the world."
