 This movie will send chills down your spine.... the music... especially the hauntingly superb ballad "questions in a world of blue" ... will both terrify and delight you simultaneously... there will be numerous scenes that actually haunt you.. though you will crave to see them again and again... a movie to watch with someone beside you.... a movie that will frighten you and make you unbelievably grief stricken at the same time...I cannot recall a movie that stays with you like this ... satisfy your curiosity... though there are a couple of negative reviews,,,.. the overwhelming number of comments are pretty much exactly like this one.... the soundtracks from FWWM and the series are also hauntingly beautiful.... if you are a DJ by chance..... play "questions in a world of blue" as a ballad at your club.... I guarantee you will be questioned as to "what was that" more than any other song you have recently played....enjoy......I think..
