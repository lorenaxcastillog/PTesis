 Another reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film. I'll second that opinion. If you have seen the remake with Michael Douglas, pretend you haven't and watch the way it SHOULD be done. If you've seen neither version of the film, get this one and get ready for anything. This is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together. Both Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are marvelous craftsmen, and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost non-stop pace from beginning to end. Again (as I've said in other of my reviews), minor characters are important. Ed Begley as the CIA boss adds weight and color to that aspect of the plot, and Richard Libertini as the South American dictator (I've never seen him play a sane character) adds another kind of raucous fun. This is a comedy for anyone who appreciates true comedy. And if you meet anybody who has seen the film, just scream, "Surpentine! Surpentine!" and watch them fall apart
