 For a lot of time I' ve checked the amazon website to find a new release of Mike Stern's dvd. One of my first dvd's collection was step a head with the Mike's participation. Well, this year my dream became in reality, and now I can enjoy all I could hope all these years. I have the opportunity ten years ago to saw Mike in Buenos Aires Argentina, and with this dvd I can relive this moment and more. I've hear Bonna's interpretation in dvds with The Pat Metheny Group and Boby Mc Ferrin, he has been excellent but Mike was capable to extract his best face of Richard, both in his improvisation both in his melodies. Always I like when the musician play at unison, well in this concert this is amazing, first the unison , after that the improvisations, and finally the unison, slow, quickly and creative. Of course I recommend this dvd, ...you must sit in you sofa and enjoy like if you stay in New Morning , Paris.
