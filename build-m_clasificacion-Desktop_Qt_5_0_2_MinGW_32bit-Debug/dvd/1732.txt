 I was enthralled with the this DVD and learned many things I did not know, especially the history of Superman on film...at the movies as well as on television. My Uncle had the original comic books, and I was lucky enough to have read all the original Superman episodes up to around 1962 when I started high school. I remember paying 10 cents a copy and the triple sized copy which came out in June just when school was over for the summer and rushing out to get my copy so I could see what adventures Superman was involved in this time and what and how he would save the world from this time! I remember George Reeves, Phyllis Coates, Noel Neill, Perry White's "Great Caesar's Ghost", Inspector Henderson....the whole shot. This DVD brings all that out, plus more. I highly recommend it for "Dyed in the Wool" Superman fans of all ages as well as just interested movie goers....it is interesting, fast-moving, entertaining as well as educational....it's good to see and hear what others have to say about what triggered their interest in Superman and what Superman is all about
