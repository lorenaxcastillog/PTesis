 This much awaited Family Guy film is really very similar to the TV series, and if you like that, you'll also like this. It feels however, not so much a film as three episodes following the same story put together. The same humour is used, but cleverly avoids falling into the trap of being the same joke repeated over and over again. As with any Family Guy show, the humour is a little risque, sometimes offensive, but always very funny. Many of the small bit-part characters (some of whom only make one appearance in the TV show,) are also given small bit parts in the film. As with the TV show, there are often little random scenes to explain jokes, and in this film, they are more frequent, and much more random, but still work all the same. The bulk of the film revolves around Brian and Stewie, which is never a bad thing. In short, if you like Family Guy, or can appreciate a childish sense of humour with many adult themes, then you will love this film.
