 This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle. I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary. It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park. When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened. Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle. These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows. As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class. When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time. Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie. Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie. Kyle Prat
