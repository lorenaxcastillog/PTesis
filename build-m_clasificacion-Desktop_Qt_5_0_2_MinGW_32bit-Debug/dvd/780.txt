 I really liked this work-out. I am so entertained by Julz Arney and I find her easy to follow. (I have one more of her work outs "Dancing off the Inches" and it is also great). You don't even realize after you are done that you have been working out for about 43 minutes (if you do the Bonus) because you have been busy dancing and having fun! I am 40 years old...refuse to grow old and I love dancing hi-hop! I have danced and worked out for 35 years and I am a certified instructor, but some of the moves were a little confusing at first. Do not be discouraged. When you get the moves (it will just click) you will have so much fun. I do this work out at least 2-3 times a week together with a weight lifting program. I find it works really well together. If I had to say one bad thing it would be that I miss a cool down at the end of the work out.
