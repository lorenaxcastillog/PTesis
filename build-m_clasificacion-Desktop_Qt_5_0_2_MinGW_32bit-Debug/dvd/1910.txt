 I am a ballet dancer and I want to clarify what one reviewer said about how this DVD is not worth it because it does not teach true barre work (since none of us have a barre in our homes). While ballet is often associated with having one hand on the barre at all times, the barre is actually supposed to be used for balance checks only, with your hand lightly resting on the barre. In fact, ideally none of us would use the barre because we all have great balance. I encourage anyone interested in this DVD to try it out and know that you do not need a barre to do plis or anything else. You will actually have better balance and quicker results by not using a barre. Oh, and the best studio I've been taught at asked us to hardly use the barre at all (except when on pointe)
