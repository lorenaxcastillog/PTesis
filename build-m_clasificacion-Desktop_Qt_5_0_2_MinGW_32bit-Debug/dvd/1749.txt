 Through a series of interviews and lectures, this movie provides a coherent framework for interpreting historical and contemporary events related to use of power and fear of terror by states. While the U.S. is used as a "case study", the analysis provided here remains sufficiently general and applicable to other powerful nations. The DvD commences with the basic and unambigiously clear definition of terrorism as stated in the U.S. army manual and works its way up to vague interpretations employed by powerful governments and news-hungry media. Chomsky's contribution in this DvD is to examine what happens if this unambigious definition of terrorism offered by the U.S. army manual was applied to the action of the U.S. government; or if the rationale used by the U.S. to justify a particular action were actually applied by less powerful nations. The Chomsky framework for exploring this topic goes well beyond a single nation or government, or a particular time period in history. Much of the ideas in this DvD have already been discussed in other Chomsky books; but this DvD weaves them well together. Highly recommended. Gabriel Katul
