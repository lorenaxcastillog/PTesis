 I've always found Martin Short to be hysterical, but you know who really surprised me here was Kurt Russell who played against type (in a role I would have seen Martin Short playing) and stole every minute of the show. The film follows a family as they hire a boat captain to help them sail their inherited boat from a Caribbean Island (something like Potato) to Miami so they can sell it. They plan on spending a family bonding 45-day adventure at sea and end up spending 45 days of hell on the water. What's great about this film is that it's far from predictable, it's humorous and witty and completely unexpected and will keep you entertained until the very end. Martin Short and Mary Kay Place are great as the loving parents who are a bit conflicted with their unconventional new captain, and Kurt, as I already mentioned, is superb as Captain Ron. Great fun for the whole family and well worth every minute of laughs, this one goes down as a classic comedy great for those rainy days (like my 4th of July)
