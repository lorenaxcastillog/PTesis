 I cannot believe how wonderful this collection is. There are six movies in this set. All of which I already have in my collection. However, the quality on 3 of 6 moview far surpasses anything that I have been able to find previously. "True Confession", "Love Before Breakfast" and "Man of the World" all have excellent picture and sound. It was my understanding that there were no surviving master prints of "True Confession". So I congragulate the person who found this high quality copy sitting somewhere in the back of some studio vault. The other three titles, "We're Not Dressing", "Hands Across the Table" and " The Princess Comes Across" are dark prints in comparison to the previous versions issued on video cassette in 1995 by MCA/Universal, but otherwise are highly watchable. The sound quality on these movies is also excellent. By this collection while you can, for the price it is a steal. It is well worth $100 or more
