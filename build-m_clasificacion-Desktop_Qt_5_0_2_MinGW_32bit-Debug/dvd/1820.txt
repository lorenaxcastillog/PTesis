 Regardless of how disenchanted one might become with its politics, its politicians, or its policies, a film like this restores one's faith in what our country has to offer its young people. Even if you happen to think the sort of ruthless competition that goes on in this film is another strike against us as a country, there's still something very moving about a child being nationally recognized and celebrated for the size of her vocabulary rather than her socio-economic background, social skills, or appearance. In a place saturated by the influence of beautiful people (valued often for nothing else), its refreshing to see the child with the braces and the bad haircut hold up a trophy that comes up to his chest, and walk away with enough money to see him through his first year of college. Beyond that, this movie is delightfully nerve-wracking! Suspenseful and full of surprises, its as entertaining as it is important.
