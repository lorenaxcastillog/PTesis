 Let me start by saying I saw this the first time it air on TV and I could not stop watching. I think that Stephen Kings movies are either superb or terrible and this movie is definately superb! I think the acting is excellent (especial Tim Daly and Colm Feore), and the plot is one that will keep you guessing. All I can say is that I couldn't figure out for the life of me what Feore wanted and when I found out at the end my mouth dropped! I would have never guessed it in 1000 years! This movie is excellent and is a must for Stephen King fans even though there was no official novel preceding this movie. If you liked the Stand and the Langoliers and you don't mind watching a 5 or 6 hour movie then check this one out, I think you will find it worth your time
