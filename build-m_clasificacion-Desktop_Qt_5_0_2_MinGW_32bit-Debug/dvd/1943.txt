 To watch the "Haunted Castle" in all of its 3-D glory is simply an awesome experience! I love watching the "Haunted Castle" in my basement, with lights off & Dolby 5.1 surround sound pumping out of every speaker. Everyone I have shown this movie to loves it and has commented on how cool it is. The combination of the fantastic 3D effects plus surround sound give this little flick something truly special! I'd give the "Haunted Castle" 100 stars if I could.....just because it is so cool. This movie would not be nearly as entertaining in 2D or with average sound. If your lucky enough to own a pair of LCD shutter glasses and have a semi decent surround system --and you have not seen the "Haunted Castle"-- I would seriously recommend you stop what your doing and purchase it immediately. For all you other suckers out there- get yourselves some shutter glasses, get that TV cranked up and check out the "Haunted Castle". It is sure to cast it's spell on you
