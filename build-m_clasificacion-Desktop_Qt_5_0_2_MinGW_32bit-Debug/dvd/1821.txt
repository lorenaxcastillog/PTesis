 "You have brought music back into my home". This is a story about a man, who lost his wife, suffered loneliness, realized the value of his family and embraces his family once again in music and drama, and falls in love with a woman of great culture and life. Tensions are high between Germany and Austria. Nazi Germany threats to occuppy Austria, raping the country of his sovereignty and independance. The Van Trap family represents the Austrian culture, naval might, and defiance of their conquerors. The Sound of Music withstands the test of time: scenery, key landmarks, picture quality alp mountains, and religous moral ideals. Julie Andrews represents the spirit of independant woman, the virtueous ideals of Mary, the zest for experience and excitement and life, and the moral courage to stand up against evil. I saluate this great movie and recommend it to all viewers that follow my reviews
