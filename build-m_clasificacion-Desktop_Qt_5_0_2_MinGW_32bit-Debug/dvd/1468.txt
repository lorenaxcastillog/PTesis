 "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is such an incredible movie! The animation is flawless, the music is heart-pounding, and the actors are superior! Forget all those nasty comments about this movie; those people are probably just trying to give Disney a hard time. I own this movie, and I can honestly tell you that it's worth watching. It ranks among my all-time favorites! Clopin is my absolute favorite animated Disney character, and Frollo is my absolute favorite Disney villain. Aside from being a terrific movie, this film also teaches important life lessons, such as how you shouldn't judge people by their outward appearance, and how you should learn to rely on God in difficult times. People complain that this movie is too dark for little kids. My youngest sister is a little kid, and she loves this movie almost as much as I do. So if you haven't seen the video yet, you don't know what you're missing
