 I very happily give this movie 5 stars. It is wonderful. Barbara Stanwyck steals the show with her wit and her charm. She's amazing. The supporting cast is great too, and I include Henry Fonda in the supporting cast, because it is Barbara's film and Henry is just the foil she plays on. One of my favorite scenes comes early when Barbara takes Henry's head in her hands and toys with him, driving him crazy. Another wonderful scene is just before she meets him, when she is analyzing all the other women who are ogling him on the boat. But I can name pretty much every scene in this film as a special one. So many of the old time movies are overrated. This one isn't. This one doesn't miss a beat through all the intervening years, and if it was released today just as it is, it would deserve the Oscar for Best Picture of 2005, while Barbara Stanwyck would easily win Best Actress of 2005. There is no one today who could touch her in this performance
