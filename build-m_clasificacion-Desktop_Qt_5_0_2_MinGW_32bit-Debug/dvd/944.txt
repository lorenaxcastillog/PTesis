 I was stationed overseas at Incirlk AFB, Turkey in 1988 when I rented this film from the very limited selection of the Base Video Rental Store. I had started to read the Bible seriously at that time and I rented this film to give me some idea of "Bible Times". I thought the film to be not that bad. Edward Woodword is outstanding as Saul. In my book...he steals the show from the deadpan Gere. You can tell he is a classicaly trained English actor and very professional. There is one scene when Saul is describing his relationship with God "He [God] struggles with man during his life....but when you look for him He is gone". Woodword gives a intense portrayal of a mentally overcome Saul struggling with his own sin and guilt. It is worth buying the film just for Woodwords performance if you ask me. If you can get over Mical's (Saul's Daughter) boobs and Bathsheba's nude bathing scene...then this is not that bad of a film. Compared with the Passion of the Christ it is downright campy.
