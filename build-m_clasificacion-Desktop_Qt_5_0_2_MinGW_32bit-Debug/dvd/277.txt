 An excellent DVD for someone to begin practicing qigong. Easy to learn and beautiful to look at, these exercises are the most effective and popular qigong movements for the last 1,000 years. This DVD also has a lot of information on it for someone interested in learning more and going deeper, with a long instructional section with Master Yang, where he explains exactly how and why these qigong exercises work. He goes into great detail explaining the breathing and qi energy, with specific instruction on many skills, such as generating 'guardian qi' to protect your health. His teaching style is very clear and, balanced with evidence from Western medical society and a lot of historical knowledge, this is the most complete qigong video out there. He shows how to do each move in various ways, depending if you are flexible already or not. Clearly, he is experienced with teaching students of all ages and health levels. The subtitles are great, the Glossary of Chinese terms pertaining to Chinese qigong is amazing, and the half hour of trailers for other YMAA Tai Chi and Kung Fu videos is inspiring
