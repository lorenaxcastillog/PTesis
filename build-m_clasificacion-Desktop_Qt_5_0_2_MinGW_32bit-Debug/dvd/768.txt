 "Bruce Almighty" is, without a doubt, Jim Carrey's best film to date! As Bruce Nolan, Carrey delivers yet another brilliantly-wacky performance, while also bringing some more to the role as a man who learns what it really means to be God. Morgan Freeman is actually very believable as God, giving Him both a mystique, as well as a sense of humor. And, even though I'm not the biggest fan of Jennifer Aniston, she does a good job as Grace. While the film is very funny, it is also very insightful. We question God's plans for us, but in the end, He knows the best for every single one of us. And even if we think we could do a better job than Him, think again. And finally, we should start thinking of others, instead of ourselves all the time. These are poignant messages, even today. "Bruce Almighty" is a very good film. It's a comedy, and so much more as well! Movie/DVD Grade:
