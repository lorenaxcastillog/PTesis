 This DVD's 40-minute program covers the very basics of newborn care. Please note that the content is on caring for a newborn; if your baby is already a few weeks old, you most likely won't need this as you won't be able to learn anything new. The DVD is divided into over a dozen chapters. Each cheapter is very short, with a nurse (or is she a midwife?) demonstrating newborn care techniques, such as feeding, swadding, dressing, etc. She never explains in detail some of the intricacies in caring for a baby. For example, if a baby cries her heart out during diaper change, what should a parent do? In the end, this title feels incomplete and unsatisfactory. The "bonus" chapter on baby gear is a complete joke, with the model quickly running through a list of things while pointing her right hand at each in the same way. Really annoying. I would not recommend this video at all unless you are (like I was) completely clueless. Even then, you can find this at your local library or on Netflix
