 This movie, based on an excellent novel by Richard Matheson, is almost as good as its written counterpart. The book is a horror classic, and one of those books you can't put down until its over. The movie captures the essence of the book. Its plot is flawless (thanks to Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay), and the movie is very well done. Supposedly it's based on some other haunted-house movies like "The Haunting". I didn't think so (in fact i didn't like "the haunting" very much, i think it's extremely slow and boring), as the only thing this two movies have in common is the fact they take place in haunted houses.I really liked this movie, and i think its groundbreaking. I've seen some modern documentaries (1990s) on ghosts and hauntings, and they found relation between electromagnetic fields and supernatural ocurrences. This movie is the first one (at least the first one i've ever seen) that incorporates this ideas, and very early on (1970s). You really have to watch it! Oh, and if i didn't mention it early, its very SCARY!
