 I hadn't seen this one since it first came out, though I had seen it several times back then. What a delight to revisit something of this quality and style. Newman and Redford were at the very top of their form. But perhaps that's saying too little of them since they've continued to produce superb performances since. What delighted even more is that there isn't a single performance flaw anywhere in the film. Each actor turns in a bravura performance IN THAT ROLE. It's what I've come to expect in the British films where even four year olds shine through like masters. It's not generally been the case with American films. The relationship between the two stars is very different than that they showed us in Butch Cassidy. But they both seem to relax and find the intricacies of their parts tending to make you lose track of the fact that it's two major stars. You believe them, just as they are. Robert Shaw, Henry VIII in Man For All Seasons, turns in one of his more chilling performances as the mobster target of the sting operation. A great DVD to own and return to every couple of years.
