 Like others sitcoms, Good Times was better in its earlier seasons, especially when John Amos was still on the show as James Evans, Jr. In fact, Amos did some of the best acting on the show. Good Times was a look at a family in the ghetto who managed to navigate through poverty, the sexual revolution, racial changes and so much more during a volatile time in our nation's history. The interplay between Esther Rolle (Florida) and the children is hilarious, bombastic, but always loving. It showed a family pull together with love, honor, and dignity. I wish amidst all the new reality shows, trash talk shows, and MTV, that there could be just ONE show like Good Times. But since those days look pretty much gone, get this set of DVD's and enjoy what was a much funnier and more sane time in American television history. (P.S. One of my favorite characters on the show, but one who was not on very often was "Sweet Daddy Williams", a neighborhood loan shark and hustler. His run-ins with Florida were priceless!
