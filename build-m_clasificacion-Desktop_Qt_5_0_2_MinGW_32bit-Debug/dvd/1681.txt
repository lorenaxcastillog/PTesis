 This is a great movie, there is no doubt about it. Don Cheadle turns out his best performance ever and its great to see that a lot of research obviously went into this film from the actors, the writers and the director. The movie stays very true to detail, and it is so inspiring to witness the courage of one man, who is almost like a modern day jesus christ. This will definitely leave an effect on everyone who watches it and make you appreciate everything you have in your life. The special features are very good too, featuring a 30min documentary of the making of the movie which is entertaining and informative and the commentary is very interesting indeed. I strongly recomend this movie to not only fans of war and history movies but to anyone who likes a good drama. Another highlight is the performance of sophie onokedo, who is actually British, but is exceptional as the female lead, the wife of the hotel manager. Buy this movie even if you haven't already seen it, you won't regret it..
