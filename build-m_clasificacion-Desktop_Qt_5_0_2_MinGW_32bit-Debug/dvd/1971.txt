 Years ago, when we bought our very first dvd player, this was the first dvd we bought to go with it. We thought our young children, then 1 and 6, would get a kick out of it. I have to say that this is our family's very favorite dvd that we own. We still put it in several times a week, and many years and many dvds have passed since we bought this, but it remains our favorite. The kids love to put it in for a quiet time, or at bedtime, or when one of them is not feeling well. They all call it "the cozy dvd." I love the animated shorts on this set. Our favorite is Wynken, Blynken and Nod, followed closely by The Grasshopper and the Ants. My son loves The Skeleton Dance and Lullabye Land. Actually, they are ALL good, and we even enjoy the commentary. This is a wonderful set to own and I am sure it will remain our favorite.
