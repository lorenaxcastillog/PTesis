 What a great movie. And it's still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors. The panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying. The print that was used has stood up very well. This is the movie that got me interested in programming computers when I first saw it. Before there even was a Microsoft, I had dreams of one day building my very own super computer under a mountain somewhere. The damn things can now fall deep inside your ear canal and lodge inside your brain if you're not careful. I wish the movie had more story to it instead of just being a rather quick build-up to an even quicker ending. But this is a movie I can watch over again and again. Wow. This isn't just any movie about a mainframe and its keypunch operator. This one's the real McCoy
