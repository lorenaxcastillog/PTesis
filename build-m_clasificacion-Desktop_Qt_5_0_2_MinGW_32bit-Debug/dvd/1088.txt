 Forget "Seinfeld." I was much more excited about the playhouse coming out. Paul Ruebens is a comic genius and I'mm sorry that his career was cut short because of one incident at an adult movie theater. What was the big deal really, I mean what else does one do with your hands in that type of place? I mean he wasn't at the local moviehouse doing that so lets ALL get over it. Pee Wee was a masterfully created character. The show itself was well ahead of its time, and gave careers to Laurence Fishburne and others. Pee Wee made learning fun, he always taught us right from wrong, the importance of manners and generally always try to do the right thing and think of others. Its great to see them again, and there are new episodes that have never been seen. The secret word today is: ENJOY. Every time you play a DVD you will enjoy it so scream real loud. HA, HA!!
