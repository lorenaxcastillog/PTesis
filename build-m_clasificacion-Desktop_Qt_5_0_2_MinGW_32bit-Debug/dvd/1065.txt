 I am a teacher that has taught for twelve years both in preschool and grade school. I bought this dvd for my son who is 17 months. He was born premature and is considered speech delayed and I was thinking that this dvd might help. I was very disappointed. This dvd is nothing other than moving flash cards. The screen shows several items and repeats the item's names over and over. I understand the concept, but it failed to keep my son's attention even when I sat and watched it with him trying to redirect him toward the t.v. The second and third time viewing he wouldn't watch it at all. This dvd is going up for sale on e-bay! Save your money and just use real objects in your house in which your child shows interest. Point to those objects, play with them, and name them. This will be a much more meaningful experience for your child. If you are looking for entertaining dvds that hold a young child's attention try the Baby Einstein series or the Sesame Street sing-along dvds
