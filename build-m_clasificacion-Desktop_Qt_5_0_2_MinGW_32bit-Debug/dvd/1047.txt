 My pet peeve is people that think "things happen for a reason," which they don't. It's all random, folks! So when I saw this at the Toronto Film Festival in 2003, I was all excited. People come together randomly, and sometimes they stay together, and sometimes they don't, just like real life! Most are little vignettes, but you care about all the people. The story gets off the ground, so to speak, when an Austrian girl travels to Brazil on holiday; then her plane crashes on the return flight. This sets into motion a variety of consequences. Incredibly, the director, an attractive young woman, did not see the young Austrian girl as the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil and setting off unintended consequences elsewhere. This despite a shot of a Brazilian butterfly! Oh well. Great artists are not required to see all interpretations of their work--but this was so obvious! Anyway, a refreshing antidote to the usual "it's inevitable" school of film making
