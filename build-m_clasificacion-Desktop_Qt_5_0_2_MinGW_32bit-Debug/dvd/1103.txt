 I have had the pleasure of teaching my hearing grandchildren to sign and I was looking forward to adding this video to our signing library. I was disappointed with both the format and the word selection. The format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and the words are of marginal interest to them - market, bakery, florist, etc. My grandchildren are more interested in signs for words such as milk, eat, more, all done, mommy, daddy, baby, etc. Perhaps this video is more appropriate for older children? My grandchildren have learned more than forty signs from the My Baby Can Talk videos - they are simply enchanted by these videos. Even my older grandchildren continue to watch these videos with their younger siblings and they all interact with the videos while they watch. I would recommend this series for preverbal babies and babies who are beginning to speak.
