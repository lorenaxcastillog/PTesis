 I won't mention any names, but one of the reviewers obviously didn't watch this film because they were too busy nitpicking the film technique to even get the message. No, this film is not as action-packed as say Mission Impossible 3 or have all the Noir element intact like Brick, but if you really want to learn about how our government works, put down your civics book and watch this film. And if you watch it, I mean really watch it, it should piss you off. While we're busy writing film reviews, politicians like Tom Delay are stealing our Congress and undoing the very fabric of our country by promoting corporate greed and the neo-con agenda. And I don't care which side of the political fence you straddle, it's time to get informed, ask questions and have a voice in our government. This film is entertaining, informative and one of a few films finally zeroing in on what's going wrong with America. If all you care about is film technique, go to film school; and if you really care about what's happening in our country, then watch this film
