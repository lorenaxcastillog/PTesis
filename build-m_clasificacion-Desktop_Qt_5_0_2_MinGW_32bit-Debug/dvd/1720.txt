 I bought this video to help my body recover from my second pregnancy. As a busy mother of two I needed something that I could squeeze into whatever time I can find. The short segments allow you to do what you can, when you can. I figure 10 minutes of exercise is better than no exercise because I doubt I'll get a whole uninterrupted hour for exercise anytime soon. The best part of this video is the mama & me special feature. It's so great to feel like you are doing something for yourself and your baby at the same time. I wish there was a video with several different workouts like this! I would caution you to avoid doing this in front of your two year old new siblings. My son got jealous and I ended up trying to do it with him. 34 pounds of resistance is a little too much! The other segments are easy to follow- but I don't have the special equipment so I just improvise.
