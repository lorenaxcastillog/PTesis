 At first glance it seems like the movie isn't worth what little money you paid for it. The characters (on the back of the box) looks like something out of the 80s and the beginning is just so unfocused and slow. You literally have no idea what's going on. I had thought I wasted my money on this and wouldn't even bother to buy the second volume. But my mind change when suddenly the story line began to pick up and broken ends were tied together. Things started to make sense. The fight scenes in this are too short, but there are quite a few fight scenes to pass around and are to die for. The end of the movie leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. So, if you're looking for a good anime series that's even balanced with a good story plot and animation, but don't want to spend a hundred dollars, or more, trying to keep track of all the episodes this mini series is perfect
