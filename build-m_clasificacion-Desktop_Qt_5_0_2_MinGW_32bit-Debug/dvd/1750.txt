 The information is outstanding and should be required viewing by ALL military personnel, especially the young and ignorant who sincerely sacrifice their lives for a trumped up war that has NOTHING to do with 9/11, Osam Ben Ladin, or Saddam Hussein, but instead it has to do with one thing: oil, oil, and then more oil and the Anglo-American need to dominate that oil. The production is poor! It reminded me of the first attempts at recording that a highschool audiovisual club would make. The editing is worse. (And what is with the Japanese folk songs in the background????) Please!!!! (No, I am not xenophobic; I love the study of foreign languages and have an interesting collection of Asian folk music, but such music has no place in this film. I would write the same if it were Arlo Guthrie playing in the background.) Get by the hideous production and editing goofs and pay close attention to the MESSAGE. If you are an instructor, you MUST show this to your students. If your institution bans it, tell your students to watch it through the library system
