 I first became aware of Howard Zinn when a client left a copy of his "A People's History of the United States" as a reference for a paper I was helping him write: I was astounded and moved. I got my own copy of the history and "The Zinn Papers." I saw that last few minutes of "Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train" on the Sundance Network and getting it became paramount. The video made me remember Zinn: this white guy that was part of the Civil Rights and Anti Vietnam War movements. The pieces of the puzzle were placed. Howard Zinn is more important to America than has been acknowledged. His history is essential. To me he equals Franz Fanon in explaining how people really make history, and how badly history has been taught in U.S. schools, and how badly we have been led. Zinn qualifies as a philosopher. Zinn's history will scare many who have bought into white supremacy history. Serious history buffs should have his video and his history. It's a wonderful reference and a truth that must be told
