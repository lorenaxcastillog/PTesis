 A lot of really neat chinese philosophy was curiously spilled out during the course of this movie that remains unforgettable, as Tony Randall's bravura performance. In fact, it is Tony Randall that is the cornerstone of the movies success. The special effects manage to help tell the story in visual performance, making it utilitarian rather than incredibly special. The costumes and atmosphere are the secret performers of this hollywood classic. But it's Tony Randall that puts the genius behind the make-up that could have faltered if done less to par. His Dr. Lao characterization was the red carpet for the many zany characters to follow, all done equally well. It's funny, I saw this movie in the big sceen theater many times which entertained audiences, and when it appeared on television back in my high school days, teenagers were talking and laughing about it the next day. An added bonus feature to this movie is the colorful unique soundtrack backdropped with chinese notes that plays throughout.
