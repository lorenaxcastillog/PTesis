 I am afraid that some of the reviewers have gotten their facts wrong. My daughter is 3 and sometimes we watch it twice in the same day. In this movie, Madeline is an orphan, but the other girls are not. This is made evident in several scenes. Also it must be a school, not an orphanage, since only Madeline is an orphan. Lord Covington is not the principal, he is the owner. I have not read the books or seen the cartoons, but I am told that some of the storyline is the basis for several of the books. If that is the case, it has been interwoven wonderfully. Since I haven't read the books, I can't tell exactly where one book stops and the next one begins. As a matter of fact, I can't tell how much time elapses from the beginning to the end, other than I don't remember seeing snow, and I am guessing that it snows in Paris in the winter. I am guessing 3 months max and probably in the spring
