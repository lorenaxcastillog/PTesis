 I like this installment better than either 2nd GIG Vol.1 or the last installment of the first season. The potential of this series can be best illustrated by the use of Hideo Kuze in the "Inductance" episode. Strangely, the scope of the entire season seems to be apparent by the 8th episode ( Fake Food ). This is reminiscent of the appearance of Aoi in the 11th episode of the first season. It makes me wonder: is the series going to meander in "stand-alone" type episodes for three installments or so, before finishing with the inevitable conclusion? There are the usual bumps in the road... I don't know if it's the subtitle translation or what, but I sometimes feel like the script is contradicting itself. For example: a bunch of groups calling themselves the Individual Eleven, who never identified themselves as the Individual Eleven. Huh?! One more thing: the huge amount of audio "hiss" during the character design features. I don't recall this from earlier chapters. Oh well
