 I guess with all the news recently that Universal wants to buy Dreamworks, their DVD marketing has started to go down the toilet, as two film packs like this one useually show little effort in both making a good DVD,adding any good bones features, and then just rushing it to stores. The two movies on this gift set are rushed DVDs that were fast put together and were ment to rob you of your money. Jurassic Park III; Perhaps the worst movie that Universal has done in ten years. All special effects and no story. Sam Neill deserves better films then this, and they still want to do a Jurassic Park IV......?! Hulk; Good Movie, bad DVD release and transfer. Marvel did not like it either, nor Universal's less then promotion of the movie when it was about to be released to theaters. There's talk of Marvel taking the Hulk Movie franchise to another movie company once the righst with Universal expire. I say "Yes, Take it to a movie company that will do it right
