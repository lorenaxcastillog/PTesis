 There's one thing you will learn at the end of this movie (and it isn't even the title); that Mel Gibson is a good looking man. That's pretty much it. So, Mel can read women's minds. So cue LOTS of scenes of women checking him out, forming clear, straight sentences in their minds (does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie? If anyone could read anyone's mind, wouldn't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish, half sentences, words, songs and ideas?) But I digress. I can buy any premise if it's well thought out and, for a comedy - funny. And this isn't any of those things. Instead we get to see Mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel, Psycho II style. "Are you sure you won't have any tea, Mel? CLANNNNNNNG". Now THAT I would watch. So, is this DVD What Women Want? Maybe, but only the really stupid ones. The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u
