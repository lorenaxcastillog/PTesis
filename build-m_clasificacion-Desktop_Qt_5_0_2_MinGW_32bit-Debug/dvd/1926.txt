 Despite facing homophobia, heightism, and anti-effeminacy, Truman Capote became a star. Unfortunately, like so many others, drugs and alcohol did him in. Many viewers will relate or be fascinated by the subject's extreme highs and lows. For those who loved the film "Capote," this will give them a longitudinal look at his life, not just his Kansas days. For those who read Gerald Clarke's biography, you actually get to see Mr. Clarke speak. Unlike most men with clefts that look like the dot of an I, Mr. Clarke's cleft is shaped like an upper-case T: it is soooooo adorable. As many say comparing fictional books with movies, the biographical book was better than this A&E special, though the special is laudable too. This A&E work doesn't talk about Capote's intense rivalry with Gore Vidal. It doesn't mention the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird" who got exceptional coverage in the "Capote" film. Also, it is not mentioned that one of Truman's photos was the cover of a record by Morrissey's ex-band, The Smiths
