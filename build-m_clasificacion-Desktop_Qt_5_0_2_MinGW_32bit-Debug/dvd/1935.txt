 I wasn't going to write a review until I started to read the reviews already posted. I can't believe how many people are giving this wonderful collection fewer stars because of an annoying introduction that can easily be skipped by the press of a single button. I personally can't stand W.G. and think the introduction is politically correct hogwash. However, nobody is "forcing" me to watch it. Remember, we're reviewing CARTOONS here! All of you people who feel the need to go into a right-wing tirade and whine about liberals and communists need to get over yourselves and just enjoy the cartoons! That is why we're here, right? And so with that, I give this collection FIVE stars. I agree there isn't enough Foghorn or Yosemite, but that just gives me more to look forward to. This collection does have some of my all-time favorites, especially An Itch In Time. So let's all hit "menu" when Whoopie comes up and enjoy the show
