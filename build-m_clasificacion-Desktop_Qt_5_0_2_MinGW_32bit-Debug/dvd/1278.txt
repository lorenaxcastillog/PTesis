 Although one could dismiss this film as an extended commercial for the ketogenic diet, one also can't help but admit to the power the film contains. Buoyed by the incredible performance of Meryl Streep, FIRST DO NO HARM looks at our medical system and how it sometimes disregards the needs and desires of the patients and their families. Epilepsy is portrayed as a truly horrible disease, and when it attacks someone so young as little Robbie in this film, it only increases its destruction. How this affects a normal family and how they manage to cope with its repercussions is poignantly captured in this movie. Streep is brilliant as always and she is given good support from Fred Ward in one of his best performances and Allison Janney as the seemingly heartless doctor who negates the diet itself. Interspersed are "real" people who have benefitted from the diet in small roles. Little Seth Adkins is remarkable as Robbie, he truly makes us believe he has epilepsy. While it may be considered manipulative and one-sided, FIRST DO NO HARM is undeniably a powerful film
