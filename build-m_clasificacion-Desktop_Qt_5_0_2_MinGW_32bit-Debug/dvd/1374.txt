 The film is five stars. Mr. Brodsky plays the part of Fanta deftly, and the part itself is a most engaging and layered character. That is not to say that any of the other acting was less wonderful. The pull between wife and best friend can't end without loss, but as each person sacrifices for the wellbeing of the other, hope is born, and a happy, but not cheesy, ending comes about. Comedy because it ends well, not because it's ha ha funny all along the way (it does have its laughing moments too). That said, the DVD couldn't be read by my DVD player, and although I've had the player for a few years, it has never refused to read a Region 1 disc before. I had to watch this on my laptop where I watch discs from Europe. Disappointing, but not so much that the film is any less worth buying
