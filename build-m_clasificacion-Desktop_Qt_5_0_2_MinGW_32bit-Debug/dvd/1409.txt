 This is my favorite DVD out of all the bellydancing DVDs I own. The music is all one person on bongos, which I like very much. The dvd is broken down in 3 sections, beg, int and advanced. The menu lets you choose different levels of instructional breakdowns. You can choose a slower easier breakdowns, or faster breakdowns. You can also choose a practice performance breakdown, or just performance. This is great when you need to just refresh your memory for the routines. Jenna is the most professional bellydancer I've ever seen. You can tell she is a very well trained professional dancer buy the way she moves. The 3rd routine (the advanced level) is such a fabulous routine. It really has a "WOW!" impression. It's more of what the audience would like to see. I'm at the Intermediate level, and although very challenging, the advanced level is not impossible to master with a lot of practice.
