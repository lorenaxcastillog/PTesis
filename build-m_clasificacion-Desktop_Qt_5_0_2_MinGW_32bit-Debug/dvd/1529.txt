 In the wake of the successful remake of The Fly came this retread of the 1958 B-picture classic. A meteor crashes to the ground just outside the town of Arborville. An old man pokes at it, releasing a crimson blob that goes on the rampage, growing ever larger as it consumes every living thing in its path. Can the courageous high school kids, led by rebel biker Kevin Dillon, save the day? In this day and age when mono films are being remixed into 5.1 Stereo, it is rather surprising to encounter a relatively recent film in mere 2-channel. Other than trailers, there isn't really anything by way of extras. There are, however a surprising number of subtitle language options (seven!). Other than the (always important) widescreen presentation, there isn't a lot here, beyond the usual DVD picture and sound benefits, to distinguish this from a VHS release. Fans of the film (who know who they are) should have some fun, and the movie itself is worth a rental
