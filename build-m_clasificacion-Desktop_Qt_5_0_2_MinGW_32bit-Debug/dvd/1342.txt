 This video was so much fun. Whether you "master" the moves are not is irrelvant. You are moving and dancing and sweating the whole time! Ive never taken dance, and i got all of the movements pretty easily. Also, there is an instructional section that breaks down all the moves for you. I recommend you do this part one or two times before doing the video if youve never done any dancing before. The music is fun and the instructor is enjoyable. My roomate did the video with me and he loved it as well. He liked it so much, he suggested we do it every morning to wake up before classes. I havent worked out much before this, i just do a little pilates, so i was not surprised that i was sweating, but my roomate runs 3-5 miles daily and he was sweating too! Absolutely wonderful exercise video! The movements are far too fast for me to reccomend this video to my mother, but for me and my roomate, an excellent find!
