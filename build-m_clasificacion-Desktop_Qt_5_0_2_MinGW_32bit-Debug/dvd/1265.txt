 Wonderful trigger-happy, off-the-wall comedy by Preston Sturges about a girl (Betty Hutton) who goes to a USO pary one night and learns later that sometime during the night she got married - and pregnant - but doesn't know who the husband/father is. Town schmo Eddie Bracken wants to marry her, despite the mess she's in, and she agrees - only that would be bigamy. They have a plan, of course, which backfires in a thousand hilarious ways. All members of the Sturges Stable are present, and everyone is superb - especially William Demerest as Hutton's father. The "miracle" turns out to be sextuplets, which, in its way, solves the problems. Crude at times in the typical Sturges manner, but top-notch all the way. [Perhaps hard to believe today, but the picture was withheld for a year for censorship problems. Some consider it a miracle it made it to the screen at all; the Hays Office must have been out to lunch when this came up for review.
