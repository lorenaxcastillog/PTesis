 I had only read "Emma" once several years ago so I don't remember all the details that one finds lacking in film adaptations. But I must say that I am very pleased with this adaptation of the book. I bought this movie on a whim last week---really knowing nothing about it. I really enjoyed the enitre movie from start to finish and have watched it several times since. I think it is a "cute" story and Paltrow/Northam play a very likeable Emma/Knightley. Seeing this movie has motivated me to reread the book and although I'm not yet halfway through the book, I do find that quite a bit of the dialogue from the book is found in the movie and in general it follows the book pretty well. This is an easy to watch, feel good, romantic movie. I liked all the characters, esp Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates. Certainly a great movie to watch on dreary days to lift your spirits. I would highly recommend this to any romantics at heart.
