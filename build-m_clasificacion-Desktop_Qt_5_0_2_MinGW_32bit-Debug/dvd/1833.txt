 Rebecca Miller spins three tales of woman who decide to take their lives into their own hands. In brief vignettes featuring three contemporary actresses (Kyra Sedgwick, Parker Posey and Fairuza Balk) escaping situations of largely their own making. I have never been particularly impressed with Kyra Sedgwick, but I felt that her role and performance was the standout among the three here. As an abused woman who finally had enough abuse, she decides to leave and take the lessons she learned in dealing with her abusive life to move forward, and she is excellent as much as she is convincing. Parker Posey plays an editor who is given a plum opportunity, which in the end will alienate her from her husband and most of the middle-class trappings she has come to detest in her own life (she has chosen this path in life it seems to combat her feelings against her family). Although I generally appreciate Posey's roles, this one did not seem particularly a stretch. Fairuza Balk was good as usual.
