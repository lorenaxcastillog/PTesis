 To affirm this film ha meant that blessing moment for every actor, was far to be an exaggeration. Landau found in this challenging script, the golden opportunity to display all his immense powers as actor to shine as he did it with this extremely complex and difficult role. Perfection is perhaps a term that nearly would describe that overwhelming performance. But to be honest Landau became by himself the 95% of the film, more than to represent Lugosi he was a model, far beyond an actor. He achieved with the role of his lifetime that coveted "State of art." In what concerns to Depp we will have to remind how he grew up under this underground filmmaker; I don' t think it may sound the artistic couple Depp-Burton be reminded in the future at the same level that De Niro- Scorsesse or Wayne-Ford, for instance. And kudos too for the most artistic achievement made by Tim Burton.
