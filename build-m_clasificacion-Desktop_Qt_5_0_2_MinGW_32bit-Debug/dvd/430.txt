 I was really excited to get this DVD set. Upon arrival I quickly popped it in my DVD player and watched attentively as I became very bored and very disenchanted. The DVDs are organized in to various chapters which sound interesting, however, the selection of artists seemingly do not fit in to the themes of the chapters. I felt like the directors of the show were really stretching to make a connection within the topic of each chapter. To the lesser-informed this DVD might give you some background of the world of contemporary art but it will most likely confuse you as it does. To make a long story short, I was looking for a DVD that would key me in on the artist's M.O. but really this set only shows you a general overview of their art while focusing on the artist's neuroses and not explaining the relevance of their works in recent history. My suggestion is to forego this DVD set, pick up a concise book on modern art and draw your own conclusions as you will
