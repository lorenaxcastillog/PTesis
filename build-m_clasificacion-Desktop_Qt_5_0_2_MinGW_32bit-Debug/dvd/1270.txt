 The pretentious film goer has never had a greater ally than Lynne Ramsay's Morvern Callar. What is little more than a bland stew of typically successful indy film techniques (hand-held shot, character-based, amoral, unique, hip, naked) becomes an immenitely defensible, but truly awful film. To merely skim the surface: Why Morvern is touted as a study of progress, liberation, or self-discovery is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film; indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack. Although other indy film goers may crucify the non-believers, this sort of movie is equally disgusting as the bloated star-powered behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision. That sort, however, is only after our money. Morvern Caller is after something much more dangerous: our admiration.
