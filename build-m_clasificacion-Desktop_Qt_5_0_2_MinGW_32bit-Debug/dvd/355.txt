 X3's action was bland at best. The choreography was horrible and Ratner didn't shoot it well at all (the entire movie included). The pacing / editing was horrible, characters were killed off and not given justice (nor onscreen deaths in one instance...a real sin), and the story was rediculous. The 1st two movies would be the only reason to buy this box set, the 3rd was a disappointing P.O.S. that was rushed just so Fox could make their money. Had they waited and let Bryan Singer direct and gotten good writers such as David Hayter (who wrote the screenplay for the previous 2 X-Men movies), then X3 had plenty of potential to end on a solid note and conclude what was IMO the best superhero movies. The worst part of X3 was the fact that they couldn't follow simple continuity set up by the 1st two, it was honestly rediculous to see onscreen. You're better off just buying the 1st two dvds in their 2 pack, X3 is barely worth the disappointing view
