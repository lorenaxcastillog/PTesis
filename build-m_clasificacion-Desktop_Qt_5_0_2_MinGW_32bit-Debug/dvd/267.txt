 Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy. The middle of the film is miserable. Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending. The comedy bits are OK but few and far between. If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem. The story line has some great life lessons. Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1. put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane. For driving home those lessons, Click has some value. It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role. He has more range than you might imagine. But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film
