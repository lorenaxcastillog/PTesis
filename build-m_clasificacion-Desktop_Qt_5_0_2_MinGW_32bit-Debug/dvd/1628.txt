 This is REAL. It accurately shows the unique blend of hard work, attention to detail, and dare devil spirit embodied in every Navy pilot. This DVD goes behind and into the scenes and experiences that have caused Navy Aircraft Carrier pilots to be ranked as the absolute BEST in the World. The BLUE ANGLES are the very BEST of the BEST. Where is the recruiter? I am ready to start a new career as a Navy Pilot with a goal of becoming a Blue Angel. More Stars are needed to rate this DVD. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it 100. Reality just set in. It is too late for me to start a new career as a Navy pilot. I'll just have to watch this again and again. I hope that you enjoy this as much as I am enjoying it.
