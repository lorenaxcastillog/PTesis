 This is unquestionably the best live U2 on DVD, though "U2 Go Home -- Live from Sloane Castle" is also essential. The Zoo TV extravaganza was unprecedented in its scale and complexity, but what's amazing about this show is that the staging always complements the music, and never overwhelms it. The media-overload setup is absolutely dazzling, and it's imaginatively deployed throughout, but the emphasis is always on the four men at the heart of this great band. I bought this concert on VHS, found it later on a pirate VCD in Mexico, and am delighted to see it finally on DVD. Highlights include a "Mysterious Ways" for the ages (featuring fantastically passionate singing by Bono, and Morleigh Steinberg in a belly-dancer cameo -- she's the woman who would later become Edge's wife); a titanic "Until the End of the World" (aggressive and dangerous-seeming, in a way that U2 music rarely is); "Stay," "Bullet the Blue Sky," "Daddy's Gonna Pay ..." The rapturous Sydney crowd laps it all up and screams for more, and who wouldn't? This is an unmissable document of perhaps the most mind-bending rock-'n'-roll tour of all time
