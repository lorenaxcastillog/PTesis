 This is a really interesting film. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding it (because of certain scenes) which I'm hoping won't scare people off (somehow I don't think it will) but it really is one of those rare movies that gets you talking on so many different levels. Carlos Reygadas (the director) has a very unique style, which you cannot help but appreciate. Some of the shots in the film are just amazing! Also, I really thought the lead actress, for someone who had never acted before, did a wonderful job! I still cannot decide on the lead male (who had also never acted professionally before) but honestly his performance did not hurt the film any. What it's about: Basically a chauffeur and his wife kidnap a baby that dies in their care. The chafer confesses his secret to Ana, the daughter of a rich general, who works as a prostitute on the side, and who he drives to her "job." Carlos tries to find redemption through Ana, and ultimately falls in love with her. It is a very intense film, but absolutely worth seeing, despite the graphic scenes and controversy.
