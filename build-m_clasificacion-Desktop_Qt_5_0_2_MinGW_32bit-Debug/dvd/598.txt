 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh? But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company
