 Yes, After School Specials. This is probably one of the shows that is better on VHS because the worn tapes because so much funnier given their low production look and feel. Given that, it's one of the funniest shows ever because, like all sketch comedy, it goes too far, but it's satiric aim is dead on. The only reason this series didn't take off is that it's dramatic effect is so arcane that many who see it for the first time will be shocked, or disgusted by what they see and not watch it again. Well, even those who like the show are sometimes shocked and disgusted, but the show more than makes up for it by being absolutely hysterical and featuring performers who can improvise on a dime and have wits like razors. The same can be said of the writers. When you combine these two elements you get a timeless show and this is the beginning. Enjo
