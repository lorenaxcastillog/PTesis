 Shinichiro Watanabe's latest installment in the Samurai Champloo series delivers more of the same. Is that a good thing? Definately. The creator of the popular Cowboy Bepop, where jazz was blended in with the series, continues on blending hip-hop elements into a very adult storyline. The best part of this series, and indeed Cowboy Bepop, is it's fresh and humorous storylines. No other anime series has made me laugh out loud like Samurai Champloo and Bepop. It's not a total comedy series, but there are a lot of funny elements. Typically there will be some serious episodes followed by some funny ones mixing it up delivering a great series. If you are into anime that involves storytelling that caters to the adult more than the teen audience then you will want to check this out. I'd also recommend the Cowboy Bepop series as well as Paranoia Agent if you want anime along the same lines as this excellent series
