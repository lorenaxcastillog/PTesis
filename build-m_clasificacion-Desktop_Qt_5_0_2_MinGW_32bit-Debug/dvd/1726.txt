 Another movie with sniffling and Kleenex. Tom Hanks, as I foresaw in "Big", is absolutely superb. Another comic, like Robin Williams and Bill Murray, with marvelous depths. And yet the movie is not really about a man with AIDS, as all the critics say it should be, and then berate it because it isn't; it's about society's reaction to gays and AIDS, a much broader subject. On that scale, it delivers well. We don't need detail scenes of Tom Hanks and his lover, or his facing the disease, or any other of the nitty-gritty the critics said was lacking. I think they missed the point entirely. Washington was society, and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what Demme is trying to say to the audience. And, increasingly, I am thinking, we should be out there, living life, helping people, instead of watching them on a two-dimensional screen. Maybe movies really distance us from life, instead of imparting more knowledge.
