 Sometimes I thought that Saw and Hostel were the the best creepy-horror movies of this time!! But now here is Slither!!! On this decade there has been a huge explotation of horror movies but most of them SUCK'S!!!!!!!!!!! I mean: There has been a lot of remakes and most of those remakes are garbage!, the Rob Zombies films are copies of Texas Chaisaw Massacre and Grunge and Ring were using the scary ideas from the Exorcist. Slither is cool and overall CREEPY!!! Is not a rip-off of other films and is SOOO GROSS!!!!! YOU SEE A WOMAN THAT IS SO FAT THAT EXPLODED A BUNCH OF DISGUSTING WORMS FROM INSIDE HER, AND THEN THE WORMS GET INSIDE IN THE PEOPLE'S MOUTH AND TURN THEM INTO SOME KIND OF ZOMBIES!!!!!! MAN THIS MOVIE IS COOOOOL!!!!!!!!!! P.S: What makes horror movies scary are the creeps! not the realism!! Try other creepy movies like Creepshow 1 and 2, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hostel, Exorcist and all those horror movies that makes people look like monsters!!!!!! Adios.
