 There are many who will say that this movie is a mini-KING KONG. Certainly, they will not be wide of the mark in saying this. There are plenty of parallels between the films, no question. However, being as-such, it is not a good reason to see MJY or not see MJY. Rather, MJY is quite simply a good movie, period. Whether you compare / contrast it with KK or not, this fact remains the same. It's a much more family-friendly movie than KK and also has a lot more humor than its "big brother." The biggest reason to watch it, however, is the wonderful Charlize Theron. She is quite simply terrific as the beauty who tries to protect the ape (an ironic twist here) from the outside world. Unlike so many pretty faces in Hollywood, Charlize can actually ACT! If you're home with the family on a Friday night & you want something that will please everyone, MJY is highly recommended. Can't see anyone NOT liking this movie - period
