 This DVD takes you at a rapid speed through the basics of grammar. There are three more DVDs in this series that deal with grammar and punctuation. The DVD may be best used perhaps for a review of grammar - to brush up on what you know. If you're starting from scratch, it may also been a solid introduction - getting acquainted with the elements of grammar. If words like "adverbs" or "adjectives" sound like mystical language to you - they will be demystified here. On the other hand, if you're struggling with conjugating irregular verbs, you'll still have to pick a good grammar book and to memorize the verbs you don't know. And, as a matter of fact, this DVD is best used in conjunction with a good grammar book. DVD only helps to learn and memorize areas of grammar faster, but it does not replace the need to work separately on the areas that may be challenging for you.
