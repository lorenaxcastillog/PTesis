 This is one of a handful of films where you just watch the images unfold before you. It is impossible to really make literal sense of the story, as that is not important here. The imagery is truly stunning, a 129 minute film of moving paintings. I had an argument with a teacher over this film when he asked me what is it about? And I said "nothing". He replied (missing my point entirely) "Tell me about it!". This film reminds me of Peter Greenaway's Prospero Books, and, to a lesser extent, Dario Argento's Inferno, where the films themselves are just one astonishing image after another. This is such a great film if you allow yourself to absorb it. That's really all you can do. For those who wonder why it's called "Fellini Satyricon" and not just Satyricon...the original novel, Satyricon, is in public domain. So anyone can make a film version of it. When Fellini announced this film, there were several knock offs before Fellini's film came out. That's why it's called Fellini Satyricon. It's not just a tribute to Fellini's ego. It's a fantastic parade for your eyes..
