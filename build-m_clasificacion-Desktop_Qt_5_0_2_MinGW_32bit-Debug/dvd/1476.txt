 The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain is a lengthy last name, far more lengthy than many. The story revolves around two gentleman who after serving in Her Magesty's in the first world war are sent to Wales to survey as cartographers. Well the story takes a twist when they arrive in a small town to take the height of what to the town is a mountain and more than that the town's pride. According to the the first calculations it would seem that the mountain is not actually a mountain at all, but a hill. No big deal, right? Wrong! The town has always been sure that it has sat in view of a Welsh mountain. I won't ruin the film and give more about the plot than that, but the film is a good one. Hugh Grant gives a nice performance in this lesser known production and the enchanting Tara Fitzgerald supports gracefully. The film develops the characters in a story that most anyone can relate to. The real twist is that it's a true story explained in the end if you watch throught the credits
