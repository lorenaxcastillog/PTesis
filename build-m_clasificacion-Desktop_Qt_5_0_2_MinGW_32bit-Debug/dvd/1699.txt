 As noted in the Amazon review, the plot of this movie is somewhat trite. But in one of the rare rich uses of Robin Williams's talents, this movie really communicates the spirit of the Christ story. Most tellings of the Christ story portray him as a somber, almost morbid figure, frowning and "heavy," totally lacking in charisma -- a total downer. Such a figure would not have inspired people with the sense of love, wonder, and possibilities and would not have threatened the power structure. Robin Williams, here, embodies the spirit of Jesus, moving the children who came unto him with a sense of life. More importantly, this story shows how fragile that sense of grace is. How, even as we are touched by this immense love, we resist and wind up letting the source of that spirit be crucified. By the way, I am Jewish and an atheist. But that does not mean I don't appreciate the notion of the joy, love, and grace that visits most of us. As Ferlinghetti put it, we all await a rebirth of wonder. If only we are prepared to accept it
