 It is great to see Dylan put into perspective of the folk movement that occurred in the late 50's and early 60's that includes so many great names like Pete Seeger, Liam Clancy, Dave Van Ronk and Arlo Guthrie. Whereas Scorsese built the story of The Band around The Last Waltz concert, here he takes his time, exploring the ins and outs of Dylan's storied early years, showing how this kid from Minnesota exploded onto the folk music scene, able to absorb and assimilate both the music and the social events of the time. Seeger quickly picked up on this young talent, who like Dylan's obvious musical and social reference, Woody Guthrie, was able to capture the mood of the time. Scorsese intersperses the documentary with a number of amusing anecdotes, the best delivered by Liam Clancy. Concert footage is edited, but then there are a number of concert DVD's available of Bob through the years. You won't be disappointed.
