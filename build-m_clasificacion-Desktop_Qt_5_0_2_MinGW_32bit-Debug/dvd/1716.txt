 Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great. I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left. Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had. It was much better than I expected it would be. As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s "Alias" touches all over the place. There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool. Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish. If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film
