 I have worked out with Denise Austin in front of my television at 6:30 in the morning for quite some time. When my schedule did not allow me that time I bought two of her DVDs, allowing me to continue to work out ANYWHERE and ANYTIME! We are going to be in Florida for six weeks this winter and now I don't have to worry whether I'll have to miss my workouts. I can take my workout programs and portable DVD player with me. The DVD is divided into body sections so you can workout whichever section you choose and there are three levels of exercise so it works for everyone. I recently had foot surgery and it was nice to know I didn't have to give up my workout - I simply went back to the low impact and will gradually work my way back up as my foot heals. I LOVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND VARIETY OF HER DVDS!
