 The first time I did this workout, I made it through, maybe 30 minutes before I was DYING! It kicks your butt big time. I've always had good upper body strength, so that part was tough, but I made it through, but seriously, I could not walk down my stairs after the lower body portion, and I did not do all of it. I drink more water working out to my Firm DVD's than I do when I run four miles on my treadmill, 12 ,minute miles. Great Value. It's like having a personal trainer. ALso recommend Cardio Scultp. These Firm dvd's use circuit training to get you in shape. Non stop going, no rest in between except when you have to change your fanny lifter or get a new set of weights. Worth all the pain you feel day after, cause your body will show your hard work. Big Firm believer
