 I've read the other reviews and I don't know what version they got but the DVD I received has more than a brief scene of David with his wife (breasts CLEARLY exposed)in bed. That scene alone would not be allowed in a PG-13 movie. There is another scene where David is viewing Bathsheba bathing. She is standing, completely nude and you can see everything. Then the camera pans in close for a "waist up" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body. This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut
