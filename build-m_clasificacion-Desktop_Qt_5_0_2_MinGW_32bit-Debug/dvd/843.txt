 I have been reading the many good and bad reviews and thought I should add something. I am an expert on Bob Fosse and his work. This particular production was pulled together by Kathryn Doby (Bobby's assistant for years). It was rather hasty in putting together as it was meant for a television broadcast. In the process of setting the time format for television many cuts were made to the original script, which unfortunetly are now not available. What is important about this version is it allows the closest view of Bobby's original work that we may ever have. Bob worked on this show while at great odds of the composer (Schwartz), to the point of having him barred from rehersals. It is amazing the show ever made it to where it got. The fact that we can still see the original art that was the choreography of Bobby, is the ONLY reason that this video should be in your collection. He won the Tony award for his work on this show (he also won the oscar for Cabaret and the Emmy for Liza with a Z this same year, the ONLY director to EVER do that) Enjoy
