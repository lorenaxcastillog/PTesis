 My criticisms are there are form corrections missing in some exercises and there is really no proper breathing instruction. Their outfits are dated (which is amusing) but the exercises are very challenging and some of the moves were awkward for me and could be really dangerous to a "nubie". I didn't really groove on the warm-up portion at all - it was okay. However, I thought the upper body work-out was effective and I thought her cool downs and stretching portions were great. Again, not for the uninitiated - should you buy this DVD I would recommend doing a run through with no weights (or if you must use 1-3 lb wrist weights) so you can concentrate on getting the moves/form correct. There are no fancy foot moves which I like. I've done many home video workouts and this one was really long and super tough. I'm really traditional so I will stick to my Tammy & Minna videos. Note: the DVD is set up so you can break the workout into segments
