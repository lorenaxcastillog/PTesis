 I was curious when I saw an actor in this movie, that I watched in another movie, and rented this one. It is a nostalgic look at the 50's--the southern version. I found it interesting to see this group of "Prim and Proper" Southern White girls sneaking off to the beach with Southern White boys to dance and have a good time--I did enjoy the music, and the fact that they featured a Black Band doing the music. That was the best part of this film--the music, which was the only thing not hindered by race at that time. I also enjoyed watching sons and daughters or grand daughters even, of Hollywood legends, who I learn to all like by the end of the movie. The guys were all handsome, but to me, the so-called "geek-glasses-wearing" girl, Luanne, got the BEST guy. I can only be referring ,,,,,who is just as handsome as his father. I liked that, because HE IS the type of guy that a lot of US "Southern Girls" would go for
