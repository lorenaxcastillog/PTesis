 "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" brings together two threads of this moviegoer's interest, in that it pairs lead actor Romain Duris (from "L'Auberge Espagnole") with director Jacques Audiard (fresh off the amazing, unsurpassable "Read My Lips"). For admirers of Duris' winsome performance in 'Espagnole,' prepare for an altogether different viewing experience, as his portrayal as the manic, self-loathing, roiling Tom is about as different as you could possibly imagine. Like in "Read My Lips," Audiard's depiction of a seedy, nocturnal urban underbelly rules here. Thankfully, Audiard gets 'Lips' protagonist Emanuelle Devos (surely one of the most compellingly unique actresses ever to grace a screen) to appear to a relatively minor role. The movie belongs to the combination of Audiard and Duris though, with the director providing a storyline, setting and energy that propels Duris to rip through 107 minutes of searing, believeable intensity. Still, given the option, this reviewer recommends you see "Read My Lips" first, followed afterwards by this one
