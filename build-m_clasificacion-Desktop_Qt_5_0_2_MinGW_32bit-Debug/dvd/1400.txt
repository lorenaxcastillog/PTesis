 I'll admit it up front. I do not enjoy or appreciate slapstick comedy. But since L&H are legendary, I thought I should see something they've done. Well I think I made a good choice because these short films (about an hour each) are very entertaining, even for non-slapstick appreciators. I especially liked a scene in 'Way Out West' in which Stan & Ollie perform a dance routine in front of a saloon while cowboys sing a song on the porch. It's almost surreal and a little out of place with the rest of the movie, which is as expected, mostly slapstick. 'Block-Heads' is also very good, especially when Ollie thinks Stan has only one leg (he doesn't), and he proceeds to carry him everywhere. Naturally, Stan just thinks Ollie is being nice, so he lets him. I can see no reason why this DVD would not have any slapstick fan falling down laughing
