 Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it. No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next. If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal. Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases. I have to wonder what they could be: "Damned Melon!" or "I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!"??? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether. In sum, don't waste your time
