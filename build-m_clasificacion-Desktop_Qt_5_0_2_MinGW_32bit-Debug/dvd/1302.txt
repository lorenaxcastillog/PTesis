 kris Kristoferson delivers the performance of his career in the flashbacks-only portrayal of crooked Rio County, TX Sheriff Charlie Wade. When his shot-up corpse is found, 40 years later, Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper) must confront his own past and the shadow of his father, the late, legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds. A lot of still-hot embers are dug up as the modern-day lawman rakes through the ashes of a sordid local past. The plot twists keep coming right up until the end. Yet, the murder mystery, interesting though it is, is not the great strength of Lone Star. Director John Sayles, a New Yorker, must have has some local Texas assistance because STAR is one of the most accurate slice-of-life films ever. As a resident of a place with nearly the same cultural, ethnic, and linguistic tensions and taboos, I vouch for the keen dialogue, sharp eye for detail, and dead-on accurate portrayals of the people and opinions of the region. The human drama and social issues add as much to LONE STAR as the murder mystery. By all means get this DVD and prepare to enjoy STAR multiple times
