 This is one of the first Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's I purchased, and I have come to appreciate it even more over time. The first set is a Basic Spinal Series which has done wonders for my back. I'm an IT professional who sits at a desk all day and tend to accumlate a lot of tension in that area. After doing the first set of exercises on this DVD, I feel an immediate release of tension and my back feels relaxed and wonderful for hours. The second set of exercises is the Five Tibetans. These are at more of an intermediate level and I am still working my way toward being able to do all of the repititions of each exercise. I had read elsewhere about the youth-restoring effects of the Five Tibetans and am looking forward to deriving their full benefits. All in all, a great DVD and I highly recommend it
