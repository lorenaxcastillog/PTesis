 I Love, Love, LOVE The L Word! This is the best series about women BY FAR! A lot of people have compared it to QAF (Queer As Folk), but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, as both are amazing series. I own the 1st and 2nd L Word seasons (and have watched them over and over), and the 3rd is on it's way to my home as I type. I cannot wait! This (3rd) season is pretty heavy. It is also shorter than the other two (I think). But, I have to say I still loved it so much! I cried like a baby towards the end of the season (those who watched it should know why). If you are a lesbian, and want to see a series that you can relate to, I would definately reccommend this series!!! It's great because it takes away stereotypes and lets people see that we are all just normal gals, who happen to love other normal gals
