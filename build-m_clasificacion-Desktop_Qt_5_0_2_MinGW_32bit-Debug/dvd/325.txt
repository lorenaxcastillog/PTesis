 This is a great pixar movie. This is my personal favorite pixar film. It is extremely good graphics. The director went on tracks to see how the track would look, and asked real nascar narraters to do the narrating for the race scenes. The plot is very good. Its about a car named Lightning MC Queen. His life was racing, and he was rude to people. Then he gets... Well you better find the rest out yourself. The jokes are funny, and the cast is so good. This is a great movie for every one. The bonus features are good to. Theres the bloopers but without the credits, and then the inspiration for cars. The sneak peaks are not to good though. There is 5.1 sound and there scene selections are good. There is allot so you can find where you left off. I cant wait untill the 2 disc special edition comes out! This is good movie for everyone from 5 to as old as you get. So I recommend this movie cars. You will have a long road ahead of you!
