 I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one.
