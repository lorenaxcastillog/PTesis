 Although this is really a serious movie, it is very funny at the same time. Having been in a british-style brass band here in the United States that went to the "nationals" (NABBA), this was a very enjoyable movie to watch. Ewen McGregor is listed as a supporting actor in the movie, but it is really an ensemble cast. Pete Postlethwaite runs amuck going from highs to absolute lows throughout the picture. The brass band is a real band from England and this is a true story that is being told. The William Tell Overture would never be used as the "test" piece for a brass band championship, but it is very recognizeable to a wider audience and makes for a great finale piece as it is used in the movie. It is fun to hear a brass band perform the piece. I highly recommend this movie. It is a real sleeper and deserves to be seen
