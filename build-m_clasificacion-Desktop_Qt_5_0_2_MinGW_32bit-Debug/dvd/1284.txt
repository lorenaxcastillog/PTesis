 All three of these movies were among the greatest social commentaries of 1970s. They were quintessential in showing us how America lost its innocence; from the corruption in our government to the bastardization of the media to our adoration of scandal. I suppose Sidney Lumet's "Serpico" should have been included in this set too, as that film was the first to record the depth of corruption in the police force, but I have to admit, "Dog Day Afternoon" is a lot more entertaining! All three of these movies are scintillating entertainment on an intellectual scale that Hollywood rarely measures up to anymore. But these films are also great and important in how they foretold the pathetic state that our media is in now (including the lack of investigative journalism in our current printed press). In fact, "All The President's Men" is as politically relevant as ever - the similarities with this administration are very interesting! And WOW! -- all the extras on these discs look phenomenal!! I'm glad I hadn't bought the earlier 'no extras' releases of these films. If you've already bought them buy this set anyway - you know you're gonna watch them hundreds of times!
