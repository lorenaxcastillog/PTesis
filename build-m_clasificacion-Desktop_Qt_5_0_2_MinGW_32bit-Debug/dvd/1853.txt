 Marc Singer is a bloke from England who moved to New York City, saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets, and became friends with them. They in turn trusted him, accepted him as one of their own, and showed him their secret living quarters. Deep underground in abandoned train tunnels, the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets. Intelligent and resourceful, they had hooked up to free electricity and had working TV's and stoves. What makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary. Only there do you learn that the movie crew WERE the tunnel folks. Only there do you learn how Singer made this movie with no money, equipment, or knowledge of filmmaking. This movie took six years from start to finish. Unfortunately, it was not the financial success its producers hoped for. But it resonates unbelievably. The deleted scenes are not to be missed, although some are much better than others. The one where a man talks about how his cousin killed a cat for food, and the scene where two young men talk in X-rated detail about recent sexual activities lent nothing to the film
