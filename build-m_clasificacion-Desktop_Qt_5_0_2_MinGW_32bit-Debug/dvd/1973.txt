 This is definately my favorite movie from Deepa Mehta, the female director who also wrote Heat and Fire, with 'Water' being the last film of this trilogy. The movie takes an intimate story, of the little girl-widow and the people around her, to become a microcosm of the reality of India at the time Ghandi and independance from the British. The whole movie then acts as a metaphor of India as a new independant nation (in the western sense of the world); a confrontation of tradition vs the modernity that the country is confronting, and how that battle will affect the lives of its inhabitants, to the smallest of them. The end scene is one of the most moving i have seen in any other pictures before. One of those rare films that reafirms the realization that the reality of a nation is reflected in the everyday reality of its people. HIghly recommended
