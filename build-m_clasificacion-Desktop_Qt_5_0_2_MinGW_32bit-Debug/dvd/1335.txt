 This is a 30 minute lower body sculpting workout led by Lisa Kay, one of my favorite Firm instructors. To do this workout, you need a range of dumbbells such as 5 and 8 pounds. You also need the Firm's FannyLifter, which is 14" step made up of 6" and 8" segments. If you don't have the FannyLifter, you will need a sturdy step of some kind. The workout consists of a variety of classic lower body strengthening moves. You will do many leg presses, the Firm's signature move, some with tempo variations. Lunges, dips and squats are combined with an emphasis on the calf. There are two aerobic "break" segments. In other Firm sculpting videos, such as Total Sculpt with Abs, the aerobic segments are welcome breaks that give you a little rest while keeping your heart rate up there. Not so in Lower Body Sculpt I. The aerobic segments target the same muscles you were just working with weights, so it intensifies the sculpting effect. This is definitely a worthwhile purchase if you want to focus on sculpting your lower body. I recommend purchasing Upper Body Sculpt as well so you can tone your entire body.
