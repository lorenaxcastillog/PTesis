 I'm a writer and my goal in this career i have chosen is to tell stories about people and emotions and the things we go through in life. having watched all the ghibli films released in america, i can say that this is probably my favorite next to spirited away. words can't describe the sheer nakedness of the story and how the company has captured the innocent nature of "young adults". i have noticed that all ghibli films touch on the human aspect of development and the coming of age story. the characters act like real people and the movements and gestures make it seem more full than most anime. i won't describe the plot since many below me have already done that. i just wanted to tell my experience with this film. i purchased it the day it came out. along with howls moving castle. i went home and watched it first. it totally captivated me and embraced me with it's honest feelings and truthfullness. i highly recommend seeing this movie. here's hope that ghibli and disney will release the other "lost" gems from their collection. "only yesterday" and "ocean waves" cheers
