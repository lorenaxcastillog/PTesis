 Right off, this endearing indie about a train-watching dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who unexpectedly inherits an isolated train station in the boonies of New Jersey deserves every single award it won at Sundance and every morsel of praise I can heap on it. Peter Dinklage is a marvel in this, his first big lead role, as his character Fin McBride slowly comes to terms with life, death, loneliness, and the true meaning of friendship. Director Thomas McCarthy lets his story unfold in due time, and allows each actor live and breathe their characters. The supporting cast, led by Bobby Cannavale as the super-chatty hot-dog/coffee cart jockey Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the depressed artist Olivia, is absolutely top-notch. Without sounding pretentious - The Station Agent is great cinema. Off the subject: say what you will about Miramax and producer Harvey Weinstein - the 'independent' studio has given filmmakers an amazing outlet to create some very, very good movies. I wish the rest of Hollywood was as innovative and creative..
