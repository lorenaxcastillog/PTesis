 Even if you are aware of what the Panic Room in the movie is all about, (you already know that when you watch the trailer) the screenplay and story are good enough to keep you hooked till the end. There are a number of nicely-handled tense moments. Wait towards the end for the macabre things to happen in the story though in the beginning one is lead to believe that it is going to be a "Home Alone" kind of a thing where the intruders are simply going to be outsmarted all the time and that no murders or killings would take place. Brilliant piece of acting by Jody Foster particularly in the scene when the cops come home to check if anything is wrong in the household and when she is forced to prove them that everything is alright. The conclusion of the story was also a fair one. Not a boring movie. Four stars
