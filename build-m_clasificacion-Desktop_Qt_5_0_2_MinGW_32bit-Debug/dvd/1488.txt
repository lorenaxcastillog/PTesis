 In fact, I'd like to rate it as 4 and a half stars for this DVDs set. The reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me is because the game 7 (1988 semi-final) I got was not really completely, it didn't included the first minute of the game, and in the end of the game, it also missed about 10 seconds. However, it didn't really missed the famous duel between Bird and Wilkins. But still, it would be really nice if I can get a "completely" game. And from some of the previous reviews, it looks like I was just unlucky to get the incomplete one (or the faulty one). But it's really a great DVDs set for all the basketball fan, since it doesn't really matter you love/like Larry Bird (or Celtics) or not, he is a ture legend, and you should own one if you really enjoy the basketball game
