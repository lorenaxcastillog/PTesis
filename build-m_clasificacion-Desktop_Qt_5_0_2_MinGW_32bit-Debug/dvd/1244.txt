 Patriot Games is a good thriller based on the very famous Tom Clancy novel. This movie has good suspense, good action and a good conclusion. At times, the movie is slow moving and a little unrealisitc but hey.. The movie's about an ex CIA guy, Jack Ryan played by Harrison Ford who goes on vacation with his wife and daughter. But, of course, something goes wrong. They go to London and Jack becomes a hero when he saves a higly ranked Englishman's life. But, in the process, he kills one of the terrorists that attacked him. And the brother of the guy he killed isn't pleased. And that terrorist and his pals go to the U.S to get revenge, mainly by targeting Ryan's wife and kid. So Ryan is on the most important case of his life where he has to save his family. The movie includes one very suspensful scene where the terrorists are in a van on the highway shooting machine guns at Ryan's wife's Porsche. That should make you want to watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good thriller, Tom Clancy style.
