 If you've ever wondered what MSNBC's Keith Olbermann would be like if he was not such an extremist left-wing [insert appropriate expletive here], here is your chance. Good Night, and Good Luck tells the story of Edward R. Murrow, the original hard-hitting reporter, and his news campaign against Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy's attempts at fear-mongering by falsely accusing government employees of being Commies (or at least Communist sympathizers) are quelled by Murrow's excellent investigative journalism and fearless ambition (as Jon Stewart once noted, the film IS a period piece). As for the movie itself, David Strathairn nails the look, voice, and attitude of Murrow, and is backed by a superb supporting cast including Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr., and George Clooney, who also directs the film. The black and white film style accentuates the feeling of authenticity, plunging us into 1950s America. This is a modern cinematic masterpiece that should not be missed
