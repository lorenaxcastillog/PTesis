 Successful in describing what Cuba is all about, this film is also about life. It made me think that, not only in this writer's case, but great writings or other creative works were made in prison. There is something about prison that can force us grasp the nature of life. Or perhaps it can also be said that nothing can kill truly liberal mind. In the movie, English was spoken among Cubans in Cuba, whereas suddenly they start speaking Spanish without translation. I find it very annoying. It makes a perfect sense if they spoke Spanish in Cuban prison and start speaking English after he left Cuba. I live in Miami and am surrounded by thousands of Cubans, so I know that Cubans in Cuba do not typically speak English to have conversations among themselves. I don't mind subtitles while the scene was in Cuba, and I wish what was what they did. Unfortunately this language mix-up is the reason why I cannot give 5 stars.
