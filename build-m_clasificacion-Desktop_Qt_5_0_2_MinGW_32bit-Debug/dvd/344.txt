 I know Gary Moore Is not the greatest on this dvd. I bought it was not very happy.Then I seen another dvd by Gary Moore called Ballads & Blues 1982 -1994.Also on the dvd was live Blues with BB King. Since I love blues Gary Moore & BB King.It was a Import only a few sellers were selling it.I bought one when It came I put it in my dvd player.This dvd of Gary Moore with BB King blew me away.I went back on amazon to see if there were any more left.They were all gone for about 2 or 3 months.Was told the dvd Is rare & hard to find.After keeping my eyes open for a while.It was for sale on amazon again bought 2 more.I did not know if the dvd would be available again.Its a piece of history to own for Gary Moore & BB King fans
