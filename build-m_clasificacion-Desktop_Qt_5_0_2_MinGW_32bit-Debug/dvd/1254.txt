 When you are a serious science fiction fan, you can not watch a new show going off the prior works of writers, actors, directors, etc. You have to have an open mind. JMS did a great job with &quot;B5&quot; (except for the 5th season) and while &quot;Jeremiah&quot; is nothing like &quot;B5&quot; it is still a good show to watch. It takes place a couple of years after a plague wipes out everyone on the planet over the age of puberty and leave the young to survive alone without adults. I watched the pilot of &quot;Jeremiah&quot; when I got a free copy after I purchased a &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; boxed set. I enjoyed it and bought the first season set. If you watch sci-fi shows soley because you like certain areas of the sci-fi universe, ie. space battles, aliens, etc. then this is not for you. But if you just like to get your fix of sci-fi no matter what, then try watching the show. Sci-fi is not always about warping, gating, or transporting you across the galaxy, some things can happen right here.
