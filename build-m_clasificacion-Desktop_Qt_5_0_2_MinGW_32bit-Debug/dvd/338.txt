 As many reviewers note, New Orleans police drama "The Big Easy" exudes Cajun charm and Big Easy atmosphere enough to make you taste the Oyster Po'Boys and Chicory Coffee! But the fabulous capture of local ambience is not in and of itself what makes this opus a tip-top choice for every DVD library. Big Easy is a fine police drama/romance/morality play in and of itself. Dennis Quaid is a sexy young police Lieutenant named Remy McSwain. he's been a good guy but the toll of little gratuities and favors is adding up. Can he redeem himself to help equally sexy Assistant DA Ellen Barkin solve a police corruption case. A top-notch supporting cast includes Ned Beatty, John Goodman and the absolutely magnificent little role for Charles Ludlam as attorney Lamar Parmentel. Remy oozes oleaginous charm as part of a huge family of cops and firemen. That, his gator obsession (note the props and decor carefully!) just fit so well with the catchy Xydeco soundtrack. Don't miss this film. An overlooked classic of the 80's!
