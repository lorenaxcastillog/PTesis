 I am very impressed with the Brainy Baby videos we have tried so far (Shapes & Colors; English; Animals). My 16-mo-old is captivated by this Shapes & Colors video and I've been amazed by all the shapes she can identify (triangle, circle, square, rectangle, oval, heart, star, crescent). I'm not saying she learned all of this from this video; she's also learning from books, puzzles and our conversations in "everyday life." But what I like most about these Brainy Baby videos -- as compared to Baby Einstein -- is that they name the objects clearly as they show them. The BE videos we have tend to show objects along with nice music (and my daughter enjoys naming the objects as she sees them), but as she is quite interested in learning names for objects right now, I like the fact that these videos name everything. If your child likes you to read word/picture books or identify every object they see, these videos will probably be a great hit
