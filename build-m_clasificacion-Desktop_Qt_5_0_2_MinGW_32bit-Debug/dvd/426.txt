 Y'know - I don't care what anyone else says 'bout this film. I liked it so there... :g: It was a good bit of childish fun at times, as well as a lot of drama. I cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war. It's got funny stuff with the cousin and "It", which Eddie voices ever so brilliantly... and I loved the aunt.. I knew she was something special, siding with the children and helping them. I loved her! Kenneth Brannagh was hilarious as well. I don't know - I just loved it. I think you should give it a dry. I think it's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like CS Lewis or even Tolkien at times. the moral of the story... wishes can't last forever... but you'll just have to see the movie to see what I'm talking about, now won't you? :
