 I've always loved this film. I remember watching it at Christmas time every year since I was a little kid. You would think I would get sick of it. Far from it. The scenery, the settings, the charaters, but most of all the MUSIC. Watch this and you'll be humming certain songs for days. The casting here is spot-on. Julie Andrews will forevermore be remembered as Maria, the troublesome nun who attempts to be a nanny to seven children. Christopher Plummer is great as Captain VonTrapp, the aristocratic ex-navy captain, who rediscovers the importance of music and love in life. The children are wonderful. Each of them does just the right job with their roles, and of course they sing beautifully. The cinematography is beautiful here, as the background setting of Austria is so vividly captured on film. This film transferred beautifully to DVD, with wonderful clarity and sharpness, and the film has never sounded better. I've reviewed many classic films, and I've enjoyed them all, but this one has a special place in my heart. Get this for your collection, it's truly worth it
