 This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative. I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis. Just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character, and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges. The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions. He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact. Jim Hellwig declined, & used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit. This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world, but it was too shortlived. Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory, but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair, Piper, Hogan, and the most respected of all The Undertaker
