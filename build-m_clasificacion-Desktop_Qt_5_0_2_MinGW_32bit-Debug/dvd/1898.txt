 This is the best comedy of all time. I have watched hundreds of comedies, but this is the only one that I am able to watch over and over again. Every time I watch this movie, I notice something funny that I did not see before. This is well worth your time and money. The acting is superb and the script is full of originality and classic one liners. Look for a young kevin bacon in his first major role. Also observe that John vernon is playing in a comedy role. John vernon plays the college dean, but he also plays the mayor in the movie "dirty harry" and if you see both movies there is quite a contrast. This is just a wonderful movie. Here is a bit of trivia for you... John Belushi was the highest paid actor when this movie was made (he earned a mere $200,000). This movie is great. Simply wonderful
