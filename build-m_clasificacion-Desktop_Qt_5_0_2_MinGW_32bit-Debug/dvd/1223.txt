 I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to. I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things. I turned it off after that. Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon. Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old
