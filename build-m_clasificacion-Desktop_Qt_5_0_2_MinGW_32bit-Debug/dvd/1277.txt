 Any effort to survey the whole history of the Broadway musical theatre inevitably involves difficult choices of what to include and what to omit, plus the scarcity of earliest material. On the whole, the six-episode documentary works....I don't know how many factual errors were made or how many errors were picked up by other reviewers, but as a major fan of Jimmy Durante and the author of what is the most comprehensive coverage of his career (JIMMY DURANTE: HIS SHOW BUSINESS CAREER, McFarland & Company, 1995, still in print), I was startled to see in the "musical comedies" section of episode two, just before the Jolson segment, that a brief clip from an unidentified movie claimed it showed, left to right, (Lou) Clayton, (Jimmy) Durante, and (Eddie) Jackson. In fact the people were Rudy Vallee, Jimmy Durante, and Cliff ("Ukelele Ike") Edwards, from the Fox film GEORGE WHITE'S SCANDALS (1934), not the famous vaudeville team of Clayton, Jackson and Durante. That team appeared in only one film, ROADHOUSE NIGHTS (Paramount, 1930), together with Helen Morgan. Neither Durante nor his early partners ever appeared in any of George White's theatre productions
