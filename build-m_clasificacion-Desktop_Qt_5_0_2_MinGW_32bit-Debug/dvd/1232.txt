 If you think "The Mummy" is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again. "The Mummy" of 1999 is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) flick as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts. Everything magically works in "The Mummy" granting us a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene -- it's a hoot). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah grants some highly comedic moments as Rachael's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasle. "The Mummy" is not great ponderous art as in, say, "Apocalypse Now" or "2001: A Space Odyssey," but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level it's film-making of the highest order
