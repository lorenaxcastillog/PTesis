 Personally, I quite enjoyed this film. I orginally chose to watch it out of an interest in the Tudor family. However, I had little specific knowledge of Lady Jane's history. It was a little slow at times, and I'll admit to finding it a few minutes too long, but, overall, I rather liked it. Naturally, I was quite disappointed to learn afterwards that the romance between Jane and Guilford was wholly fabricated. Some may complain that it ruins the film, but I disagree. I felt it was a welcome addition, as it added humanity and beauty to a bleak, tragic story, making it easier to relate to. I actually found the romance plausible, though not terribly likely. But I am a romantic, not a realist. Those who prefer action films or accurate factual reports may not enjoy the film, but it's a must for any idealists in possesion of true Rennaissance hearts
