 This is truly an amazing film. It's obvious that the makers of the film were subtlely trying to draw paralells between the expansionism of Spain in the late 16th century to the turmoil that was occuring in Europe in 1940, the year the film was made. This is done so expertly by director Michael Curtiz that it does not detract from your enjoyment of the film's action sequences. The film is first rate all the way from it's sets, it's score, and editing. I'd like to reiterate an earlier reviewer in stating that the sepia tones employed for the Panama sequences are breathtaking. The performances here are all first-rate with star Errol Flynn as Captain Geoffrey Thorpe doing probably the best work of his career. The always dependable Claude Rains assays a complex account of villainy as Spanish ambassador Alvarez. Flora Robson does a powerful turn as Queen Elizabeth. Alan Hale, usually comic relief in Flynn's films, even gives a restrained performance as Thorpe's first mate. It does this film a disservice to pigeonhole it as a swashbuckler because there is so much texture here that it can be appreciated on so many levels.
