 Wow this volume of the second gig series is sweet. There is a ton of action in all the episodes and the CG sequences are better than ever. Furthermore, you also finally get clued-in on the majors past and who Goda is. The sound/music of this dvd is amazing. In these 4 episodes, more so than the last 8, the producers have heavily mixed in some of the best and mostly unheard of, GITS OST music scores- over the action and over the dialogue, making each episode have more of a movie like flow. Also what's even more impressive is that for the first time, in a long while, you actually get to see a fully CG animated ghost dive. Now as for the Tachikoma's, they are in full force in this DVD, however, there jobs are a bit different than usual, they get to help the Section 9 crew ghost dive!, yea and there humor is also intact in this volume as well. As I said before, very impressive for a continuation of the series, definitely a must see
