 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this. Really, I did. Sadly, this film stinks. The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson. What a monster! Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life. Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny. Only a few scenes made me grin. The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film. In addition, the camera work was very jerky. Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies) The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division. Too bad the members of this band are minor characters. I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better
