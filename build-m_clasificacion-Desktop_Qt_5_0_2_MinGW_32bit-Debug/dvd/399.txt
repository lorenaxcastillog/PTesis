 To those who "hate" this movie, please forgive us culturally depraved, lowly, bottom-feeding scum for daring to appreciate the pure entertainment and moral value of a polished, well-intentioned movie that seeks to depict the good and bad within our diverse African-American attitudes and ways of life. Let's not forget that this is just a movie, and Tyler Perry has ingeniously used this medium in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously. Only someone with more of an open mind could appreciate that and know that there are some things you simply won't "get" not being African-American. That doesn't mean everyone who's black will like this film -- but clearly by the majority of reviews on this web site, there's a reason this film rates so highly among us "po, ignorant" dark masses! :) Tyler, keep doing what you're doing! Signed, a lover and participant of all legitimate art, both "high" and "low" as long as it's relevant. Peace
