 There are already great reviews giving previews of the movie so I'll not do that again. My son is 15 and my husband and I are in our 40's. We both adore this movie. You must sit back and take the time to see (and enjoy) the humor, share in the pain(s), the quirkiness, the light romance and be a part of this village of people who will use a number of means to turn their hill into a mountain. Did I mention that the movie is based on a true story? This is one of those movies that the more times you watch it, the more things you see and catch...ahhh. Give it a chance, you may be happily surprised. We've rewatched it a couple of times a year since it first came out and truly enjoy it each and every time. I think now we sit in anticipation of what's to come. I'm already grinning just from thinking of the sugar and the train. It's time to watch it again.
