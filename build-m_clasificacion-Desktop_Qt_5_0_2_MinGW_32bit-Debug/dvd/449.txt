 I wanted to exercise with dance steps as I had some experience in the past. After looking through number of DVDs, I chose this one, and I'm glad I did. There are 8 variations and I could learn them all after trying them a few times. Paula's fancy moves are intimidating at a first glance, but when you take away all the frills, the steps are actually simple. I don't do anything that might injure my knees. I often convine two steps into one and change a few movements to suit myself. The lower body workout (mostly squats) and cool down are effective too. She's very pleasant and her interview is encouraging too. The only improvent they can make is to show the steps slowly at first. They are much too fast for anyone who's not used to dancing, but you can overcome the inconvenience by rewinding the DVD and finding out the basic moves. You need a relatively big space to do all the moves. I'n now trying to dance with my favorite Welsh music. It's easy to find songs that fit the steps. I say this DVD is worth the price
