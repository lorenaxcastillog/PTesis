 Disney DVD has announced 4 episodes that will be included in this collection: 1) "The Fourth Anniversary Show" : 1957 DISNEYLAND season opener, originally aired 9/11/57 on ABC. 2) "I Captured The King of the Leprechauns" : this last DISNEYLAND episode of the 1958 season was a big promo for the Darby O'Gill movie, originally aired 5/29/59 on ABC. *** This has already been released as a bonus on the Darby O'Gill DVD. *** 3) "Kodak Presents Disneyland '59" : a long thought lost TV special, not part of the DISNEYLAND series. This is well worth getting this set for! 4) "Disneyland 10th Anniversary Show" : from the 1964 season of Wonderful World Of Color, originally aired 1/3/65 on NBC. *** This has already been released on a Disney Treasures DVD Tin called "Disneyland U.S.A." in the first wave! Sure that DVD is out of print, but It is disappointing not to have a new to DVD episode included here. There are SO many episodes in which Walt plays a major part, this DOUBLE DIPPING is regrettable! *** Disney says the other episodes are yet to be announced
