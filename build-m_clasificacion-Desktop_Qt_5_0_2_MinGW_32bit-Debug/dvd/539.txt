 I wanted to throw in my 2 cents here - I really liked this series. The music is a good creepy mood setter, the character design is unique (I like the Mataichi Gang's caricaturized look and how non-main characters are nearly blankfaced or kind of resemble goblins or elves), and the stories are pretty cool. In the tradition of many anime I've seen, the story does start a bit abruptly, forcing the audience to simply accept the characters as they are and ride along with the story, which begins with small isolated vignettes connected only by the characters observing, gradually building to a larger plot climax. Regardless, the self-contained stories are entertaining. It's similar to series like Vampire Princess Miyu, and is reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt in its blood-and-gore themed morality tale. Not for the faint of heart, of course, but definitely entertaining if you're in the mood for some macabre tales to creep you out a bit.
