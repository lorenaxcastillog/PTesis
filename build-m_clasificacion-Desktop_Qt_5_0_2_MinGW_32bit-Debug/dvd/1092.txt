 An excellent comedy, Kindergarten Cop, brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal. What complicates things is that it's Arnold Schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher... The film combines comedy with action and adventure though it is primarily a comedy and a great one at that! Arnold Schwarzenegger, (!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! In short, Kindergarten Cop is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!
