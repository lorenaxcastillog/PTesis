 This does not engage my 9-month-old at all, who loves the Baby Einstein "Old MacDonald" and "Neighborhood Animals" and used to love all Bach, Beethovens, and Mozarts. These dvds are the only thing that will actually keep her still when eating or when it's time to calm down before nap and bed. I was excited to introduce her to a new concept and this movie is just horrible. It is very cheaply made and it keeps showing the same garden twirling star toy over and over again. You would really think they would find more creative toys to put into the video. So why 2 stars and not 1? I do like that the planets are named and footage of the real planets are shown as well as the stars. But other than that, it is just terrible and not a learning experience nor a tool for me to begin her quiet time.
