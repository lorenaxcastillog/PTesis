 This is a very memorable movie that you can feel and even touch it. imagine that you are going to a vacation. 1 week to a hotel. you may probably find some friends there. a week of peace or adventure. and after it's over, all people go their ways. but the memories remain. for example after 2 or 3 years you come back to the same place, you'll not enjoy again. memories bothering you! and that's exactly what happened to me when I whatch 1945 remake! it was in no way could be compare with magnificent 1932 original movie! grand hotel had one of the best cast selection I've ever seen. Actings were awsome! and the atmosphere of the movie was magnificent. hope the story was more sophisticated and the if movie could last one more hour! this movie really needs a good remake. not only a remake! a good one! with accurate cast selection and more sophisticated story. anyway I admire it and love it! Quality of the DVD was magnifecent too! very bright sound and picture quality for a 73 years old movie! I loved it! Really loved it!
