 It's interesting that some of the reviews state the audio is poor quality and cameras are overexposed and that it seems a little home-made. That's exactly why I like this DVD. It's an actual concert and for whatever reason, I feel I am there, in the streets of Rockford, and a part of the audience. The audio is actually quite decent, however, the microphones do pick up a lot of the ambient crowd noise. But in no way does it detract from the music. In fact, that's part of what I like about it. It is, after all, a street concert (actually a park concert, but you get the idea). No big screen TV's, fireworks, lasers, stealth bombers flying overhead, etc. Who needs that when you have the energy of Robin Zander, Rick Nielsen, Tom Petersson, Bun E Carlos, Jon Brant, and special guests that make this cocnert rock! These awesome band members are doing what they do best, and it's very clear they are enjoying every minute of it
