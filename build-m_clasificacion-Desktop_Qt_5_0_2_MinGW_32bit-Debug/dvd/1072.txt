 I am a cartoon, and a comic fan. I have been for years. I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do. The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch. But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far. There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers. Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room. I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film. For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often. For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again
