 I stumbled upon this movie on cable and am glad I did. Other reviews identify that this movie is about three people, each speaking different languages, who meet and interact. I believe, though, that this movie really portrays the dynamics of communciations on many levels. It is striking that these three people never learn each other's language but instead hold conversations based on what each one ASSUMES is being disussed. I've likened this movie's theme to the problems I've observed (and experienced) in the communications between technical people and executives, women and men, parents and children --you name it. We make the conversation fit what we understand (and want) the purpose to be rather than really make an effort to understand what the other person is actually saying. That really IS deep. Throw in the subtle humor and the beautiful scenery and you'll find this is a movie that makes one laugh and think- and is certainly worth watching
