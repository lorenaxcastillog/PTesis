 I frequently gift this DVD to men and women over 50 years old; they love it! The movie transports us to a kinder, gentler moment. This comedy of manners plays on the naive innocence of the heroine, who has been insulated from the dangers of the world in her orphanage. Margaret Sullivan is a delight. She's selected by a movie owner to drum up business at his movie theatre (based on her looks, perhaps). At the movies, she meets a film watcher who works as a waiter. In good faith, he invites her to dinner at his fancy restaurant. Sitting alone as an attractive young lady, she becomes the target of an old seducer, a man rich and frivolous. Enter the waiter who tries everything to save the girl's chastity. Such a film is impossible today but I adored its simple charm and grace. The film title will become clear to those who watch the film (I won't give the secret away) Recommended
