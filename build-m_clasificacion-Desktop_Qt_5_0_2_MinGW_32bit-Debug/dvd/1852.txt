 I found my copy of this movie in the trash and it sat in my entertainment center for two years. I paid little attention to the (brilliant) cast -- Donald Pleasance, Robert Duvall, Donald Sutherland, Michael Caine, Larry Hagman, Treat Williams, and a very young Jeff Conaway, to name a few -- nor the plot description on the case, assuming it was a lousy low budget war flick. Man, was that a stupid assumption. The Eagle Has Landed is great! It's well-scripted, well-acted, and suspenseful (despite knowing the inevitable outcome.) One of this movie's strengths is that it avoids one of the most annoying things about other WWII movies: bad (or no) accents. It is annoying to watch war movies in which the Nazi villains sound like they were born and raised in London. In Eagle, the actors playing Germans (Caine, Duvall, Pleasance) make at least an attempt to carry off a German accent, giving the movie more credibility than most others like it. As good as this movie was, I'm surprised it's gotten so little attention or recognition in 30 years.
