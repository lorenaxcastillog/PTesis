 For pure thrills, fun and entertainment, few movies in recent memory can beat this 2003 smash. Anchored by a strong, fun plot, dazzling special effects and an instant classic performance by Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl" is a fantastic movie and the msot fun one can have while watching one. When Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter, is kidnapped by the evil (and undead) Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), her friend since childhood, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), sets out to rescue her. In desparation, he joins forces with the wily Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own vendetta gainst Barbossa: Barbossa has taken over his ship, The Black Pearl. What ensues is nonstop action meshed in with great bits of humor and dazzling special effects. The undead zombie pirates are a great spectacle, and the set pieces and performances (even Bloom performs well in this one) are dazzling. This two disc special edition comes with a treasure trove of amazng extras. This is a film that belongs in any and all dvd collections. It is one truly worth having.
