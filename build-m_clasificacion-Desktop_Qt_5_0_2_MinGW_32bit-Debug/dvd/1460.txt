 I almost didn't give it a chance. Early on Melvin, his buddy, and the two babes, all thirty something's seemed to be those yuppie people from one of the coasts that have it all and bitch too much, spoiled whiners. There were a few confusing timeline cuts, back and forth to show little bits of their lives, but again, I stayed with it. About a half hour into the film, which I understand was a Michael Blieden play, that is adapted to film, I realized that these folks have some problems and are sort of witty in describing the mature dating and marriage scene. Then the revelations get sexier and suprising. Then it gets very suprising, revelations of horny 30's at play making mistakes and being human. As noted by everyone, Jack Black does a very funny cameo, a spacey riff that I followed to my amazement. Of course you have to be a skitso or a believer to understand. Also, this isn't a sweeping scenery film. It's a play and people sit around the table talking. If the dialogue wasn't witty, festival audiences wouldn't have gone nuts.
