 This movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out. An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy. It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences. However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes? I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me. If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away? Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating? Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss? If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version. I find this version incomplete somehow. But Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation
