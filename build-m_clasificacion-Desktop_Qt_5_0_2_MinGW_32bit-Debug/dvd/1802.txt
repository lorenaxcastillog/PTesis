 Sorry, after minority report, which actually looked great compared to this performance of cruise, i didn't think it could get worse...yeah, it did. I didn't rank a one because it was a classic story, and the action was ok at times, but Crazy Cruise was just a stinker in it. I just didn't care for his performance. I can't help expecting every time tom cruise opens his mouth to expect to hear "show me the money". I was hoping spielberg would have cast an unknown in this spot, or someone that could look a bit more grubby, more manly, cruise still looks like a kid. Definitely not the original radio brodcast. Tim Robins did a fair job, I would have liked to see him in the main character roll than cruise. Catch this one on TV, HBO or something, or rent it if you must, just not my collection type movie though. I know my review is taking a beating, but I just didn't care for this movie
