 I was never a fan of the Boston Celtics. I respected them, sure, but I could never see myself rooting for them. That all changed when I first bought an NBA video entitled "Larry Bird, A Basketball Legend" way back in 1991. I had just bought the Magic Johnson one, and wanted to see his greatest rival. While I am slightly disappointed with the flow of the story and am somewhat uncomfortable with the monotonous narration of Daniel Stern (hence the 4 star rating), I can safely say that the video did what I did not think possible: turn me into a Larry Bird fan. That was then. Fast forward to recent history. When I saw in Amazon that LBABL was being re-issued in DVD form, I jumped at the chance to get it. Of course, it helped a lot to have classic Larry games included! The Pros: Nice game selection. The video itself was moving. The Cons: Where was Game 5 of the 1991 Eastern First Round against Indiana? I think no game defined Larry more than that one. Also, remember the comments I made earlier..
