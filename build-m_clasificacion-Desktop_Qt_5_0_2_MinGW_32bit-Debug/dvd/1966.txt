 Hey, I'm an old guitar player (61) and I really enjoyed both Carlton and Lukather jammin' their hearts out. I can see that they were both having a good time and were very loose--to say the least. THey come from different sides of the guitar world but, boy they both can play. I've been a Carlton fan for decades and this is the first time I have seen Luke play--yep I dig it. They both play from the heart and have a world of chops--that and a great band to support you, what else would you want? They give each other space to burn, and there's mutual respect here, no trying to "one up". Very enjoyable watching two world class players smokin' and having a lot of fun. To me this is another learning experience and I probably watched it 15 times the first week that I had it. I've been playing for almost 50 years and still love this stuff
