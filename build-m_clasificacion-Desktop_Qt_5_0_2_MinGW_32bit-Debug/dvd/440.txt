 As a fan of the orignal GitS, and of Stand Alone Complex Vol. 1, I really looked forward to Vol. 2 and I was not disappointed. The story continued where it left off in Vol. 1, but this time we learn even more about the Major, her skills and maybe a small scene to some, but to me when she blocked a blow and it...well, don't want to spoil it, but it shows how powerfully build she is. While the Laughing Man from the first vol. took up lots of the time, the other episodes showed more of her personality. Including a huge surprise about her love life that was cut-out of the US verison of GitS comic. The art, action are crisp and clean, the US voice acting is very good, not perfect at times, but they've spend money getting some good voice actors. As for the sound complain in another review, I started off with no sound, then realised that I had set-up for DTS sound, which I don't have. After resetting to stereo the sound came on and it sounded great. I recommend Ghost in the Shell for any anime fan.
