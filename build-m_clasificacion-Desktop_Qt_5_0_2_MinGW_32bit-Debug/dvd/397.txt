 When I saw that the movie was from the creators of Legally Blonde, I figured it would be original and hilarious, boy was I wrong. It is so ridiculously predictable, I mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot. The plot wasnt even that great. When Topher Grace was trying to show is affection for Kate Bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious. I mean Kate Bosworth's character had to be stupid not to see that Topher was in love with her. Plus Bosworth's character was quiet annoying. Her hair was bothering me the whole movie, and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part. I agree with another review who said "what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar" let alone on a date with a human, it was gross. I would not recommend this movie , entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy.
