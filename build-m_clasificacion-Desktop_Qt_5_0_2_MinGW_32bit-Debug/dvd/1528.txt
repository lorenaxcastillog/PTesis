 This 1988 re-make of the classic 50's horror film may have a few misfires here and there and it may look a bit dated, but it's a surprisingly good re-make which is quite a rarity. Nightmare on Elm Street 3 director Chuck Russell, who would go on to direct the Mask and Eraser, is at the helm of this gross-out romp with Kevin Dillon starring as a teenage rebel outsider who allies himself with a cheerleader (Saw's Shawnee Smith) when a murderous, slimy, monster goes on a rampage through their small town. The blood and gore effects are great for their time, while the effects of the Blob monster itself look a little dated. Everything else about this re-make however is still better than you would expect, including some imaginitive deaths. The cast also includes ER's Paul McCrane, and look for small roles featuring Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak and David Lynch regular and Eraserhead star Jack Nance as a hospital doctor.
