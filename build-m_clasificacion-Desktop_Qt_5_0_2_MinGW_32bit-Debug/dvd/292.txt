 Se7en is one of the best crime thrillers of all time and probably has the best cinamatography I've ever seen, the film has the darkest atmosphere and probably influenced a ton of other generic hollywood thrillers and yet remains the only original thriller that manages to creep you out with out having any cliches. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were terrific in thier roles as the two detectives and have a tremendous job of making thier characters more than one dimensional you also get to see thier personal lives and then wonder how they don't get effected by the violence that surrounds them. All the se7en grisly murders that occur in the film are based on the seven deadly sins like greed, envy, sloth ect. that are done by a mysterious killer called John Doe cause they obviously don't know his name. So the film turns into this ultimate cat and mouse game with a very nice backdrop of the city which looks dark and is constantly raining, David Fincher does a great job with the direction almost giving it a gothic look. Overall this film is fantastic and is highly recomended don't miss it
