 Like him or not, Gilbert Gottfried is one of the most interesting and unorthodox comics working today. Of course the jokes are old, and many are familiar to most of us, which is the obvious gimmick of the show (ergo the title). If you know and like Gottfried, then you know that it's not the moldy joke but the way it is delivered that matters, and Gottfried has a mostly masterful method. When a joke fails (and the audience is pretty bland here), Gottfried's ability to retrieve the moment often results in a far funnier and bizarre running commentary and/or audience critique, which has always been his strongest point (there are occasional and unfortunate end-of-joke cuts which disrupt the rhythm, but they aren't overly disruptive). If there were other records of his stand-up currently available on the market, then I would lessen my rating to four stars, since his original work is generally more rewarding. Since it is all that is presently out there, it gets five. Unlike the pandering observational humor of Jerry Seinfeld or the family-friendly musings of Bill Cosby (both of whom get mocked fairly mercilessly here), "Dirty Jokes" is not for all tastes...thank God
