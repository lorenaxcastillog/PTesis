 Oh my gosh, this is probably one of the best workout DVD's EVER and I'm addicted to The Firm. The instructor is upbeat and she is REAL... she's even SWEATING along with the rest of us. There are nO thong leotards to be seen, and each exercise was easy to follow... I love the movements, everything. I recommend, however, that if you're relatively new to step, WATCH each segment for a minute to figure out the step routine and then rewind and try it yourself. Also, if a move is tricky, try it on the floor before going up on the step. When you're trying to learn a new move - Like I was with this DVD - it's safer and easier to try the steps on the floor. This was extremely easy to follow and I really enjoyed it! I can't wait to work out to it tonight. :
