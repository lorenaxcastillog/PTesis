 I saw the first dirty dancing and loved it, so I was afraid of what DD Havana Nights was going to turn out like, and it turns out, I enjoyed it much more than the original. I'll admit, the dialogues aren't great, and the plot as far as the political context leaves to be desired, but truthfully, I didn't care at all, and who would? It's not a movie about the political context, it's about dancing, and DD Havana Nights is a success. Diego Luna and Romola Garai are fantastic, they dance really well together, everything fits in that area. And the dancing in itself put together with the amazing soundrack just makes the whole experience highly enjoyable. It will have you dancing in your seat and wanting to get up and dance with them. It's a great movie I'd recommend to anyone who likes these types of dance movies
