 'Once and Again' represented to me the highest point in television drama. This more-than-memorable series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves. Fine acting, brilliant writing, exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series. Not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories, but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series. Intimacy, nudity, sexuality, and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty. Deep character development was the standard not the exception...even for characters that had more peripheral roles. The series was genuine. I never felt a false moment. I was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years. Apparently mainstream Americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work (or perhaps after 9/11)...or perhaps ABC did not promote it in a proper timeslot. Regardless, My only solace remains that I can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via DVD.
