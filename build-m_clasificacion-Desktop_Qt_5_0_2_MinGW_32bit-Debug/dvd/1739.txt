 This was my second DVD following Ana & Ravi's Yoga Beauty Body which was also a great place to start. I loved Beauty Body so much I wanted to try more. I am so happy I did! Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond is a bit challenging for a beginner but like their other DVD very accessible and it is really fun to see what you used to think impossible, very do-able after a couple weeks. The up-dog, down, dog, and camel poses used to kill me but now I find I look forward to them. Seems the thigh muscles, shoulders and abs are quick to improve, which is very rewarding in itself! I have come to really enjoy Ana & Ravi's encouraging style of yoga, great music, flowing rhythm, and encouraging instruction. The length is just right for me, with a good warm up,and two 25 minute sets. There is also the breath primer which nicely explains the breath of fire. I look forward to trying more of their programs! Today I am on Amazon to buy Dance the Chakras Yoga Workout which everyone is raving about on my online fitness forum
