 I won't give away plot or character... you can get this info from other reviewers. I will tell you something else. I've seen this film once, a year ago. I hated it then. (Maybe my hetero-ness got in the way and I momentarily forgot that beauty is in the eye of the beholder... ) But from time to time images from the film crop into my head. They leave... eventually they come back. They always come back. How many works of art can say THAT? This is a haunting film, a tragic one. You will be touched... although maybe not right away. Give it a chance and it will be like one of those dreams you had twenty years ago and every now and then an image from that dream will pop into your head. I've been to Venice. The city is like no other. And this film, perhaps, also, ... like no other
