 ok.. I absolutely loved this movie but went expecting vampires.. IF they had advertised this movie as a typical Tarantino Action/esque type film and then they hit you with the vampires it would have been so much better.. sort of like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS if they could have kept the punch line out of the media etc.. It would have been awesome.. the moment they tell you that the calls are coming from inside the house it would have been priceless.. With this movie.. they advertisted it as a VAMPIRE MOVIE but if they could have kept that surprise away from us it would have been awesome.. I mean.. I watched it with my step dad and he had no clue it was about vampires.. he thought it was a Crime/Action type movie.. then all of a sudden BLA-DOW!!! VAMPIRES and hew as like what the...... and it was beutiful but regardless of my little rant this movie rocks! saw it in the theater and own it on VHS as well as DVD can't go wrong!
