 Abba Eban was not only the most accomplished and articulate of all Israeli diplomats, he was also a person of immense learning and intelligence. Had he wished he could have taken a different road in life and become like his close friend, Bernard Lewis, a great scholar. Instead he made a certain sacrifice and devoted his life to the cause of helping the Jewish state come into being and survive. This nine- part series is not concentrated on Israel but rather is a survey of Jewish civilization. Eban tries to show us how Jews interacted with the surrounding world, both learning and giving to the larger native socieities. From Babylon and Egypt to the Western Civlization of the present day Eban relates a story of a small people's long journey and meetings with others. This is an illuminating survey and will give anyone who wishes to know more about Jewish life and history a real opportunity to do so
