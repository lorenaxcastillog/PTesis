 Wow,it's about time ! This was the best series of the 70's,and gets better every year !All the Mystery Movies in the 70's were really good,but Susan Saint James,and Rock Hudson,brought realism to the series.They were a believable couple.The scripts were good as mysteries,with a hint of comedy.Nancy Walker,and John Schuck,completed the chemistry of the series.Too bad we don't have series today of this caliber.The quality of the DVD is outstanding,and brings back fond memories,with a better than original picture !They are the kind of television movies,that one can watch over,and over.We are anxiously awaiting season two !Saint James is a much better actress,than she was ever given credit for !The actual DVD disc is particular in what brand of machine it likes.I have three machines,and one machine didn't want to play the disc.I inserted it several times before it began to play.This however,was not the case in my other two DVD machines,which played the disc perfectly,without a hitch.Just a note to the manufacturer for consideration,if there is a season two forthcoming.This being said,I still rate the series,actors,and the DVD Five Stars !
