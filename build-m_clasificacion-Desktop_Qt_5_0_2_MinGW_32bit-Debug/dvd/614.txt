 The only reaosn this show gets more than one star is because at the very least you can see that money is spent on it. the presentation is solid. however, if i wanted to watch (let alone buy) a series which is centered around a bunch of wanking rich kids i would walk around at the highschool i graduated from 7 years ago. its all the same uninteresting [...] that people escape come graduation time senior year. ive listened to scattered episodes from several seasons as background noise after whatever i was watching before it, but the show itself is aweful. like i said, a bunch of rich kids with nothing to gripe about, griping about nothing. bottom line: [...] happens. you either get passed it, or you dont. maybe my take on it is skewed by living (born and raised) in santa barbara CA which is about 2 hours north of the (real) OC, but is riddled with the same kinds of rich-kid problems. i would rather kill my time watching grass grow than sit down and actually watch this kind of dribble. do yourself a favor: read a book rather than buying the DVDs of the O
