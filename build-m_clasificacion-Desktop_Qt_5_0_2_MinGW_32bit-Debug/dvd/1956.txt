 Warner Bros strike again - ruining yet another cinematic masterpiece for DVD by ineptly encoding the audio as only Dolby Digital "1.0" - instead of "2.0 mono" or "2.1 mono" as most studios with half a brain (and an ounce of concern for their customers) would have done. Very few surround sound systems would have a full range centre speaker, and even if they did, they would find the audio on this DVD lacking in quality and presence. I was so annoyed with the audio that I found the DVD unwatchable in it's original form. Today I went to the trouble of doing a DVD-R copy, accepting the fact that the video would degrade slightly, but I ran the audio as downmixed 2 channel mono through a graphic equaliser to adequately boost the lower frequencies. I won't ever buy a DVD again which has its main audio track limited to Dolby Digital 1.0 and I recommend others do likewise
