 I really liked this movie when i seen it for the first time back in the begining of 1994.Recently i saw this movie on sale in circuit city for 6 dollars and bought it.After siting down and watching it again.I was amazed at how ahead of its time this movie really was.For all you people who do not get this movie,i will break it down.Basicly in a nutshell it is about a group of nobodys kidnaped and held in a 7-11.There captors dont ask for nothing,but film them the whole time.REAL Reality tv you might say.One by one they are killed of and only two remain.They finally escape and find out they are stars,for doing nothing.This movie a commentaly on the sheep mentality of the people who watch "reality TV".The same people that make nobodys,like all the winners of american idol in to the flavor of the moment.In case you were wondering SFW stands for"So F**king What".This is the conculsion Dorfman comes to at the end of the movie
