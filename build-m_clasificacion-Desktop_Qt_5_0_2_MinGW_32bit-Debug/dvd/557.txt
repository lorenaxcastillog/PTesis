 I am a huge fan of Wolf's Rain and have watched it on Adult Swim and own all the recent DVDs. This is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people. I can not wait for this DVD to come out because it has my favorite episodes on it. On this DVD, the group is still split up, but all of them, including Quint, make it to Jagara's keep and you learn more of Hige's past and his mysterious collar. If you have not seen any of the series and you buy this DVD, you will be intrigued and sucked into it until you are buying all the DVDs. That is what happened to me. I actually saw the first episode of this DVD on Adult Swim one night and was very interested and started my collection. It is worth your time to look into it.
