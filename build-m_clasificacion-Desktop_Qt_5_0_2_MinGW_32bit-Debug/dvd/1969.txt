 Anyone looking past its intentionally hokey sound effects, bad edits, and storyline holes can acknowledge WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER as the classic send-up of camp films that it is. Admittedly, there's not a lot of competition for the title (MEATBALLS, anyone?), but this movie earns its stripes with good will, funny dialogue, and preternaturally excellent casting. Michael Showalter (who co-wrote the film) is reasonably funny as the gawky counselor protagonist, and he's joined by the uniformly amusing Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon, David Hyde Pierce, Janeane Garofolo, and Michael Ian Black. A lot of care went into giving the film a sense of place as a summer camp in 1981, which, along with the ruthlessly gratuitous soundtrack, gives it the right nostalgic flavor. Sure, the last 20 minutes of the film are a write-off, but comedy movies often fall prey to the need to build the plot up to an unfunny climax. All I know is that for the first 70 minutes, I chuckled a good deal and only winced a few times; what more can you ask for
