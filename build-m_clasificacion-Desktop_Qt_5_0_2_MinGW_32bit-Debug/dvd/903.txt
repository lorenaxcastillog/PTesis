 I found this movie unpredictable, even after reading the plot on the back of the box. The acting is good and believable. Some of the scenes are designed to "shock"; The execution of these scenes are frighteningly effective. I watched this on a 13" low resolution screen with a pair of small multimedia speakers on low volume, but the scene at about 39 minutes nearly stopped my heart. If I had seen this in a theater, I may not be here to tell you about it. Seriously... if you even think you may have a heart condition, you would be well advised to have a loved-one screen this movie for you first. My only criticism, as mentioned by another reviewer, is not enough information about "Them" and their motivations to wrap my imagination around. Most young people can safely watch this movie with minimal parental input, assuming they are old enough to know that the boogie-man doesn't really exist. Refreshingly, there is no sex, although the main actor and actress who are barely acquainted, do spend 2 nights together, one in separate rooms, and one in the same bed and fully clothed
