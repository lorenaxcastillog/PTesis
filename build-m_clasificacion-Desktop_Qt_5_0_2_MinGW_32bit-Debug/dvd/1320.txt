 Finally.......this latest "newly-restored widescreen edition" presents this movie as it should be, with all its beautiful cinematography and 1.85 widescreen. The sets in here are great, a terrific look at the 1950s through storefronts, billboards, automobiles, etc. Previously, all they had was soft formatted-to-TV disc. It took me awhile to appreciate this film, too. When I shifted my focus off the irritable old woman (Jessica Tandy) to the long-suffering servant (Morgan Freeman) the whole picture changed. Once I looked at this story through "Hoke's" eyes, it became an inspiring story. Freeman's character, "Hoke Colburn," simply provides the best the example of a what true servant of God should act like, plain-and-simple. It's one of the best examples on film I've seen of of patience, kindness, dedication and dignity in a difficult situation. It's also always inspiring to see a nice, good person overturn and win over the opposite with sheer kindness. That's taking nothing away from Tandy's performance as "Miss Daisy." She is awesome. What else can you say? I may not care for the character she plays in here but acting is superb. What a talented actress. Great story, great acting, great transfer, great DVD
