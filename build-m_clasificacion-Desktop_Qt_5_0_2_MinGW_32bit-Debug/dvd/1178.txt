 I am not the most coordinated person and the first two times I tried this DVD it made me so frustrated all I could do was cry. It was hard to see what she was doing with my back to the TV! But when I realized that I didn't have to get it all 100% of the time as long as I kept moving and picked up where I could I was fine. I can now do all but the last piece, and that's more because I am just too tired after 45 minutes to keep going. But I love it! I watched each section first and then tried it, that worked pretty well. Once I had an idea of what she was doing her verbal cues made it so I didn't have to look at the TV. Very good cuing. I think I am going to order the other one!
