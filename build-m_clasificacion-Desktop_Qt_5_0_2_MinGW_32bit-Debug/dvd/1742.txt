 Ah, Office Space, one of the greatest comedies of all-time. How can you not laugh at this movie? It insults and exposes the isolation of working in a cubical in some multi-million dollar corporation, with obnoxious co-workers and a boss that overuses the word "Yeah". The red stapler scene is ALONE worth the price of the enitire movie. Of course, in the end we learn that everything will work out as long as you have that one co-worker who's a stuttering fat guy who can't stand up for himself who torches the entire building so he can get his stapler back.... *sarcasm*. But whatever. What can I say? It's classic humour. If you haven't seen this movie, get off your couch, stop watching that re-run of some WB drama, and rent - no, BUY this movie NOW! You'll never be able to stop watching Office Space. And for the record, this gets my vote for the best comedy of the entire 90s. "Oh and we have a HUGE roach problem.... so if you could.... yeah.... just go ahead and take care of that... yeah....
