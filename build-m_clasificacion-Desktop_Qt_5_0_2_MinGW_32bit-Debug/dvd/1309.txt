 ...and to be honest I hated it. She has that dramatic face in every movie, it always looks as if she's going to burst into tears or something - so she's mostly just fit, it seems to me anyway, for these tragic "no hope for mankind"-movies. Plenty is a movie so Britain-grey that you should never watch it on a day you feel tired or something, you'll only get deeply depressed. And do not misunderstand me, I am no fan of shallow comedies, I'm moved by actors like Hopkins in Shadowlands and Penn in Dead Man Walking - but the woman Streep plays in this movie, well, how many women could identify themselves with her? What is Plenty trying to tell us? Two stars for Stings' effort as Mick in the movie. Not a big role, but his character has "sex" with Streep - and is basically used by her. And finally Mick is the first to call her character "insane" if I remember right. Big Deal? No, but I am a big fan of Sting - therefor let me add : Are you a Sting-fan, add this to your Sting-dvd-collection. But watching the movie is pain!
