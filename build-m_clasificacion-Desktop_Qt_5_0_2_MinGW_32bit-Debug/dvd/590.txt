 Despite the fact that I think it's ridiculous to structure a film around the question of whether non-human beings experience emotions (only a species as arrogant and detached from nature as ours could even conceive of such a question), this film was extremely worthwhile. There were some interesting points, for instance: human anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications probably work on dogs because their brains are reasonably similar to ours; and fear is probably "the" universal emotion because it leads to survival-enhancing behavior. The footage on octopi, dogs, sea lions, rhesus monkeys, dolphins, elephants, and wolves, among other species, was beautiful to watch and often incredibly moving. While I'm glad that there is now a body of scientific work on this subject, many of us don't need science to understand that many species experience emotions as we do. Konrad Lorenz, though he was a fine scientist, was probably not relying on research when he said: "The fidelity of a dog is a precious gift demanding no less binding moral responsibilities than the friendship of a human being. The bond with a true dog is as lasting as the ties of this earth can ever be.
