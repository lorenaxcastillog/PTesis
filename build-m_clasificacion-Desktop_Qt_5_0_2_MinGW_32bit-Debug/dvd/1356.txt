 Simply put, I bought this, brought it home, and spent the wee hours of the night smiling on the couch as the one and only Buckethead filled my living room with his unique brand of guitar-shred-funk-fusion-dementia. This dvd is a trip, from the wacked out menus to the oodles of content that cover his whole career so far...videos (Praxis!), discography (you think you have it all, but I assure you, you don't), and a bonus dvd with 2 live shows (it doesn't hurt that I can see myself in the Boston one, laughing like a goon as he hands out toys). There's just tons of bucketgoodies hiding in here. This dude is just the whole package-Eddie Van Halen and Eddie Hazel all in one, mixed with Leatherface and The Shape. So rad. This dvd definitely had a lot of time and creativity put into it, so to anyone who doesn't enjoy this for the perfect representation of the Bucketman that it is, you simply be missin' the point. Might I suggest you stick to your Dream Theater/Satriani/G3 dvd's, you 5.1 Surround sound obsessed prog-metal nerds...you don't like chickens, get out the coop
