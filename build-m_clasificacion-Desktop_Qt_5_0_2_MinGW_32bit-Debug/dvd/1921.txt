 I have the Region 2 version released in the UK and I highly recommend this disc set. It contains all six episdoes and extras about an ordinary policeman drawn into a secret government branch whose purpose is to contain the most dangerous threat to the modern world - VAMPIRES. Although, this label is never used to describe their targets. This premise sounds far fetched but they do a great job of making it believable. Is this super secret group using their power to destroy a maligned group? Who really are the good guys in this innovative British series? Questions are raised and the viewer is glued to the screen as we watch this series unfold. This is a brillant crime/sci-fi genre blend that is well acted and written. The last episode in this series answers many of the questions but manages to leaves the door open.... So far no further series has been programmed and not very likely at this point; but still, it left me wanting more so this series gets my vote for great viewing pleasure. Also, I found that turning the subtitles on helped with the Brit speak that I couldn't understand.
