 I believe we now have all of the "There Goes A..." DVDs. Honestly, I don't think there is even one that my two and four-year olds would not sit and watch in their entirety. This DVD is actually MY personal favorite. Of all the Dave DVD's, I think this one is the funniest. Included in this DVD are There Goes a Firetruck, There Goes a Garbage Truck and There Goes a Truck. Whenever we're out and see a firetruck driving by, my boys want to come home and watch the firetruck show. On our garbage pick-up days they usually ask to watch the garbage truck show after the truck picks up our trash. There Goes a Truck covers numerous trucks from monster trucks to big rigs to tow trucks. There are so many funny moments between Dave and his side-kick Becky. Our favorite is on the garbage truck show when Becky drives off with Dave stuck in a truck yelling, "Wait Becky, Wait!!!" I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Dave Hood DVDs. This one is just the best of the best in our opinion! =)
