 Johnny Depp gives another sterling performance, this time as John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, and there are strong performances by John Malkovich and Samantha Morton, but overall, the movie is dark and disturbing. But I suspect that's what it was supposed to be. Critics may love this movie because of the performances, but I doubt many viewers who just want to be entertained will like it. While the performances are first rate,the movie is curtained in despair, much like the lead character. I didn't enjoy this movie, but I didn't turn it off, either. Johnny Depp was just too intriguing, and the interplay among Malkovich, Depp and Morton, too complex and fascinating. There's good dialogue in this movie, realistic settings and great costuming. But it's not a fun movie to watch. If you're looking for an uplifting, fun evening, skip this one. If you want to watch experienced and talented actors performing at their best with an intellectual script, this movie is a good choice
