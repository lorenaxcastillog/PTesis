 I would not say this is the very best movie I've ever seen, nor would I say that these are "typical" gay people (most of us tend to be a lot more boring and a lot less well-off than the characters presented here) -- but this movie does have a lot to offer, including a spectacular performance by John Glover (who, in John Jeckyll, creates a character one can really get down and "hate"!) and an empathetic performance by Jason Alexander, an HIV-positive camp queen who manages to find love in the OTHER character played by John Glover (James Jeckyll, the saintly brother who is dying from AIDS). Anyone who has lived through an intense sibling rivalry which went berserk and egos took on lives of their own should be able to relate to the dynamics of John and James Jeckyll. The most poignant scene in the entire movie is towards the end when each character depicts how and when they died -- and especially from the vantage of the one who was left (the one who owned the house) who buried them all.
