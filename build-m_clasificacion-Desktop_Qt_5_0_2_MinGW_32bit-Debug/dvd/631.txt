 I was all prepared to rate "Hard Boiled" as a slightly above average Hong Kong shoot-em-up that was entertaining but nothing that would distinguish it from similar fare. Then director John Woo serves up an inspired finale in a hospital that has to rank as one of the most ingenious action segments in screen history. The set-up is that some gangsters have stashed an arsenal in the hospital morgue. The police have uncovered the operation which leads to a stand-off between them and the hoods. Caught in between are the hospital staff, the patients, and some oh-so-cute newborn babies. The less said the better. Nevertheless, Woo throws out the rulebook as to what can be done in an action film. Woo was essentially toying with us for the first hour or so in order to throw at us this delicious curveball. I can imagine some people revulsed by this segment. Personally, I was awestruck and grateful for an artist like Woo for taking a risk
