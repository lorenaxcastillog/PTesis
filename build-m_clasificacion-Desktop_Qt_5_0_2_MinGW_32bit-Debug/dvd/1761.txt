 I never thought of reaching 40 years old to rediscover, in a film, just what we are doing here as humans, in such a clear, bright and open way. Just like in reality, in this film there are no main characters. They all are, we all are main characters. Rich, poor, men, women, happy, outsiders, truthful, hypocrites. No concessions to distinction. In every moment, all characters fully representing their roles, no matter are they in the foreground or in an almost unperceivable corner of the screen. Welcome, 1939 Jean Renoir, welcome to our future. "Stop the masquerade!", so we say to our politicians, to the media and to ourselves. "Which one of them?" is the universal answer, one of the several universal impulses of this delightful, adorable movie and of their loveable characters. That's why I end up with a classic travel-agency like clich: Enjoy life - see La Rgle du Jeu
