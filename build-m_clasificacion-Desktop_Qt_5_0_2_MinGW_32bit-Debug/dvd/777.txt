 This movie brings to light for me the all too painful memories of my Past, Pocatello Idaho, and my experience as a Mormon Missionary in Norway. Although I did not havve a romantic or sexual experience on my mission, I did not fit in with the mindset, I also had a "little secret." Aaron in this movie experiences that cut and dried die cast all or nothing reaction that all gay Mormons and gay ex-Mormons go through in the Utah-Idaho culture. The Church quickly excommunicates heretics and "perverts," yet both the Salt Lake and Pocatello valleys are clogged with us yet love conquored the extreme differences and outlooks between Aaron and Christian. Like I had to, Aaron has to give up all he used to believe to be real, truthful and authentic. Unless your heart is made of stone, or your bigotries are die cast, this movie will tenderly touch your heart! I have lived in similar circumstances, and like Aaron, my life nowadays is a testimony of victory of the human spirit over stiff, unyielding dogma. It is good to see movies like this, of successful Brokeback Mountains
