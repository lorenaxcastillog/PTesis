 I ordered this DVD last month after being a little skeptical. I usually gravitate towards fast-paced kickboxing workouts. But, I decided that I should start adding pilates/ballet type workouts for additional slimming and gave this one a try. I watched the DVD before trying it, and thought, "This will be a piece of cake!!!" The workouts seemed so simple; tiny pulses, tiny tucks, barely lifting the leg. Boy was I wrong!!! My first time doing it, my standing leg was shaking so badly I almost fell to the floor. Those tiny pulses really dig deep and are not for the faint of heart!! I find myself doing the leg/seat and ab sections only. The upper body portions just don't do it for me. (Hence my 4 out of 5 star review). But if you are looking to work your lower body like never before, this is the workout for you! Great for pear shapes like me in achieving that slim and lean look!!
