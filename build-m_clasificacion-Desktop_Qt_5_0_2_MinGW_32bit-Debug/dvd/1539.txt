 This is the first time I have ever seen pot in an anime. I have seen alcohol and mushrooms (I understand they are legally packaged and sold in Japan), but not weed. I am not condoning this, although I almost fell out of my chair when Mugen ran through a field of the stuff and, as it caught on fire, the animation became distorted and hallucinatory. It was an unrealistic portrayal, but there it was none the less, and that was cool enough. In the next episode, Mugen fights a man who traveled to china and learned to project his chi, or life energy. In the third of the disc, Jin falls for a prostitute debted to a brothel because of her husband's gambling. The fourth is a flashback episode covering the previous eleven episodes. Episodes 9-12 of 26. 9. Beatbox Bandits 10. Lethal Lunacy 11. Gamblers and Gallantry 12. The Disorder Diarie
