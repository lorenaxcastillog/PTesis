 I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick, and I can see something very special about this movie, that makes me consider this one as the second installment of a so called, by myself, "trilogy". 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange & The Shining, they three share a feeling of loneliness, a sense of an external consciousness who is watching, from outside the Universe, the characters in the films, there is a feeling of a paranormal environment, manifest by the lighting, the sharp contrast of colors white, blue, red and fog in some of the scenes. And, this special environment is made even more surreal by the very special soundtracks of "Atmospheres" by Gyorgy Ligeti , "Timesteps" by Wendy Carlos, or the score in The Shining by Carlos' couple too. Perhaps these three stories are part of the intervention of the Black Monoliths on the development of Mankind...Who knows? Buy these movies, they are highly recommended.
