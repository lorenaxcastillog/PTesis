 This is a really fine series. I've watched it four or five times, and each time an interesting hidden nugget or two pops up. Jackson dominates the film like a titan. Her prowess is undeniable and unforgettable. She gets the importance of Elizabeth's fierce intellect, and it makes every moment spent with her transparent, heightened by using Elizabeth's own words and expression. I can't think of another portrayal of Elizabeth that comes close. The film conveys mediaeval court coarseness with confidence and beauty, and it pulses with Jackson's genius beginning to end. In the presence of her Elizabeth, you're pulled way beyond acting; a coruscating diversion, and one here recommended. Each episode's script surpasses the perfect one previous, one of the film's best features. Perennial BBC production values are front and center, and the cast is crackling. Robert Hardy takes an oddly unsettling turn as Dudley, but truth is, Glenda Jackson ignites and nothing else matters. It's a tour de force full of rewards. You'll find nothing else even registering in the region. Handsome kudos to BBC and the English theatre tradition, still unsurpassed. Check it out
