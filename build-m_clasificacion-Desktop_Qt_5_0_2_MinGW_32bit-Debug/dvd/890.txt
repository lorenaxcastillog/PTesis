 To be honest, I loved the Japanese original of this movie so much that my first watching of the American version was a little tainted. But I just watched the Richard Gere version again, this time on DVD, and found that I really like it more than I realized. Gere is so winsome (I'll pay to watch him dance any day, he is aging gorgeously!), and Lopez so elegant, and all the other characters so interesting, and the music so sexy, why quibble over which movie is better? This story is entertaining and touching in its own right, even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the Japaese version. I have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years, and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions. The story is charming, adult and PG with a satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days? The DVD offers good insights into the ballroom training and hard work behind the movie, as well as a wonderful "Sway" music video. Which reminds me -- the soundtrack is excellent, and I bought that, too.
