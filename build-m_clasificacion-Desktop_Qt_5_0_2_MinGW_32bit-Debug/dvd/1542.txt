 Disclaimer: I am a Red Sox fan. If you are a Cards fan, well, you probably won't want to buy this anyway. This DVD is enjoyable, but I personally found the NESN video to be superior. The main difference is that the MLB version is a little more sanitized than the NESN one. For example, except for a very brief clip that's used in a transition, the MLB DVD makes no mention of The Slap by A-Rod. I interpret this as MLB not wanting to put one of their more marketable players in a bad light (even when he richly deserves it). The NESN video, on the other hand, does not hesitate to document this critical moment. Also, this video has a bit less material about the ALCS than the NESN video. But even the latter is too brief- that series deserves it's own DVD; I aged a good 5-10 years over the course of those 7 games. In sum, the NESN DVD (Faith Rewarded - The Historic Season of the 2004 Boston Red Sox) is a bit better than this one, but if you're a Red Sox fan, you'll want both
