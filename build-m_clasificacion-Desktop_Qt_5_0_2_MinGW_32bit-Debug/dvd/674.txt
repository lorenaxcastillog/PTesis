 This is a must see for anime fans. One suggestion though you must watch the first two dvd's before you buy this one or you won't get the full story. I am not going to give any spoilers but I want to warn everybody about false information that has been provided about this dvd. First of all the special addition DOES NOT CONTAIN 3 DISC. It comes with 2 disc and a XL large t-shirt. It is in a series box but it only holds the first three dvds. Do not throw away the insert because the first two special addition discs fit inside it. The only downside is that in the series box you will not be able to see the other two dvds. Overall I would give it three thumbs up but I don't have that many so it will have to settle for two. The movie is great. Enjoy!
