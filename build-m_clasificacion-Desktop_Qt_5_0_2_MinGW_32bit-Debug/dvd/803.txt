 The previews for this film caught my attention, so I rented it as soon as it came out. It was a very interesting and thought provoking film. How would three people with different languages and different cultures interact, especially if two of them are enemies? This film explores that question. The performances were outstanding, and the film was beautifully and artisticly done. Much of it was very funny, as the audience is let in on both what WAS being said and what was THOUGHT to be being said. One example of this is Ivan being called Gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling Veiko to get lost. Even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating. While this film is rated PG-13, parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it (I wouldn't). This is because of some issues of religion and morality (to say more would give to many plot spoilers).
