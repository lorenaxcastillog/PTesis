 This anime has a very interesting story and well developed characters compared to many anime and even independent movies. I will not get in details but I can tell you that it deals with brotherhood, romance, friendship and betrayal. In this anime you will not find any funny or riddiculous jokes as most of then have. If you agree with me, this is my point of view for some animes. Worst animes ever: Trigun: Waste of time, boredom, Inmature Madlax: Do not even try to watch this Record Of Lodoss War: Don Quixote has better action sequences than this Sadamitsu The Destroyer: He destroyed my valuable time Shuffle!: it doesn't get any worse than this The best Animes out there: Berserk: Made me want to become a fighter and a philosopher Escaflowne and Gundam Seed: I do not like mecha but this 2 are good Speed Grapher: Great, Different, fantastic Cowboy Bebop: Made me remember the good times watching Cobra Space Adventure Dragon Ball Z: Made me ask "Why didn't I watch this before" Gungrave: Read my review Gantz: Great too
