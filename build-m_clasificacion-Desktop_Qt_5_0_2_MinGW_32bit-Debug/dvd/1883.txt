 This is a fabulous workout as far as home videos go. I have several Crunch videos, and this one is by far my favorite. Violet is motivating without being overbearing. As for the person who prefers Boot Camp Training to this one, I have both videos and I get a better workout from Cardio Sculpt hands down. What I really love is the 10 minute buns segment at the end. Most times, I do the 10 minute buns immediately after Cardio Sculpt to feel like I did an intense 45 minute workout, but on some days when I lack the time or motivation, I do the 10 minute buns by itself to feel guilt-free (it will be the longest 10 minutes of your life!). At the end of this workout, I am sweating and feel like I've accomplished what I set out to do when I turned the tape on - get a great workout. You won't be disappointed with this video
