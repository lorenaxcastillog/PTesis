 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall). Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film. Then I noticed the cover. I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'. YIKES! It is! I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!). If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it. Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy
