 Back in my younger days, I probably would've filled an entire wall of my house with VHS tapes of my favourite childhood TV shows - Knight Rider, Airwolf and, of course, the A-Team. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I can now store the first four seasons in a small corner of my shelf. Looking at the series through adult eyes, it's absolutely amazing to see just how well this show has stood the test of time. When I was young, I enjoyed the totally implausible but well-mounted action scenes. As an older and wiser man, I enjoy it for the charisma of its four main stars. They all have a sense of fun, camraderie and joie de vivre about life in general that you just don't find in shows nowadays. It's amazing to see just how popular these shows still are. Like everyone else, I sometimes wish they'd bring shows like this back. Characters like Michael Knight, Stringfellow Hawke, and Hannibal Smith and co. provided some truly great role models that most of todays modern TV shows sorely lack. I wouldn't have grown up to be the man I am today without them
