 While many might feel that the term "Sphaghetti Western" connotes a type of substandard Western with low - production values and poor acting, I was pleasantly suprised with this title. Eastwood and Van Cleef were credible in their roles, the plot was solid (although a little fantastic) and the settings were breathtaking, although clearly not filmed in the United States. Whoever was behind the camera definitely had an eye for the natural beauty of what, to the more casual observer, might seem to be a manifestly desolate landscape. Van Cleef performs his role so well that this series of movies seems to be tailormade for him. Eastwood, while his performance seems somewhat stereotypical and unidimensional, is still superior to many of the actors of his day who played in westerns and some of the actors of our day. All - in - all, this movie is definitely one that merits being added to your collection.
