 This movie on Les Ballets Russes Russes de Monte Carlo takes viewers on a beautiful journey through the history of this wonderful company. My mother was one of the dancers who danced between 1938 and 1940. Her stage name was Marina Franca but she did not live long enough to take part in the reunion or the movie. Seeing the personal stories of the dancers who were interviewed made me recall all her memories of a time when great artists,choreographers and composers all brought their talents together for this travelling company. The Ballet Russe went across the U.S. to small towns and was a transitional stage between the dancing styles of Old Russia and what we now know as Modern Dance. The company did split up at one point into two companies with one touring the U.S. and the other going to Australia and South America. Even for those less interested in the ballet, this joyful movie will bring a feeling of what it was like to be on the stage and under the lights at a now historical moment in Dance
