 I agree with some comments that Robin Williams went a little over the top in this otherwise well-meaning and sweet film. The message of the film is much stronger than the messenger though, and I found it to be a very humane and inspiring vehicle for Williams' talents. A very fine supporting cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Patch's prig of a roommate, Monica Potter as his skeptical (at first) love interest and especially, the fellow who plays Truman (the tall, lanky fellow with the glasses) provided comic relief (to Robin Williams! Quite a feat!). The children in the film were all real patients, and they added a sense of realism and urgency to the film's deep and abiding message of compassion. This collector's edition has many bonus features. The one I loved the most was Shadyac's commentary. You can see that he was on a mission with this film, and you also learn a lot about his influences. He is as funny as Robin Williams, and maybe even as crazy
