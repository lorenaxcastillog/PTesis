 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero. This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair.
