 After reading the reviews above I decided to chime in with my two cents. Although I agree Joe Public may find this movie a bit dry and at times unrealistic I must say that this is an unfair assesment and that the film has it's audience. Currently I am working on my masters in Psychology and I must say that the depiction of an individual who is seriously considering suicide is far more accurate than most films today. Despite popular opinion, those who attempt suicide are rarely brudding goths who always see the more morbid side of things and listen to Metallica. They are generally normal people who just feel tired and lost, something that Paul Rudd brings across in spades. Although they seldom film their deaths, most suicide attempties do discuss killing themselves and are often aware of how "indulgent" it may seem to others, a point discussed in the film. Thus it is unfair to say that this movie is bad based on a half founded belief that the content is unrealistic
