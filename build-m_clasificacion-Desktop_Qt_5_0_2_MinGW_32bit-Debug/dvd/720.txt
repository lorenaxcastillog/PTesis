 Never have I seen a movie violate a book so badly. John Grisham's Runaway Jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction, in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on Big Tobacco in the courtroom. The movie Runaway Jury is a slapped-together suspense chase, in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers. This movie is, at most, a caricature of the book, and not a flattering one at that. Hackman transforms Fitch's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall. Parts of Marlee's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events. The most interesting aspects of the story--jury selection and Nicholas Easter's manipulation of the court--are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around. If I had never read the book, I would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick, rent-worthy at best. But knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad. Even if you aren't a lover of fiction, I highly recommend buying the book instead.
