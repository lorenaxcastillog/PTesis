 If you loved "What the Bleep Do We Know" you will love "What the Bleep Down the Rabbit Hole." All your favorite academic types appear, with more indept talk about Quantum theory. The expansiveness of the mind and the capacity of creating our own reality plus the challenge of otherness, parallel universes is the dose of what is possible I welcome. I watch either DVD at least monthly. The description of addiction, and how this traps us is another lecture I welcome. The capacity to see life as what I shape it, what I bring to the experience from a consciousness in expanded reality,what I can create is thrilling, and I feel this possibility after viewing either DVD. The only draw back in ". . . Down the Rabbit Hole" is the story line with Marlee Matlin. I would have enjoyed watching that develop and move into the future, instead of rehashing the "Bleep's" story. This is why I gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars.
