 This movie is hilarious. I'm just going to assume it's supposed to be bad. At one point I actually saw the string that was pulling the leeches along. And in the scene where the guy takes a shower, his skin colored shorts are clearly visible in several shots. The guy who I thought was the main character, I guess, wasn't because he was killed off about two-thirds of the way through. The main character is the nerd who looks like a super model and dresses in a tank top and 3/4 shorts. He looks like he belongs on a runway instead of a lab. My FAVORITE scene is when one guy tells another guy to take some pills and the other guy says "How many" and the guy says "The whole bag." LMAO! And then the moron shoves a handful of pills down his throat and washes it down with some liquor. LMAO! I mean...this movie MUST have been made to make people laugh at how stupid it is. I loved it
