 The paper I read (Argus Leader) ran an article where they had fitness experts review DVDs in various categories and whether they were "Worth The Workout". This DVD was highly rated across all categories -There a good "burn" -it was not boring, - a beginner could do it, yet parts that were challenging enough for experts - that the instructor was very good, professional and knew what she was doing - the experts would use the DVD again.) Anyway I picked up all four DVDs (there were recommendations in the general category of Cardio, Toning, Pilates and Yoga) and so far am extremely happy with all of the titles they recommended. (In fact I have some of the titles that they stated were very poor titles, and they were right there also.) So if you are looking for an excellent Pilates DVD, look no further, the experts were right on the money in their review
