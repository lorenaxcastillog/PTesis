 Archie Bunker's Place is not All in the Family, but very few sitcoms are. If you give Archie's Bunker's Place a chance you will learn it is better then most highest rated sitcoms on the Air Today in 2006. This DVD set is very good with mostly uncut Episodes as they have not been seen since they aired on CBS. Archie New Partner Part 1 seems to be the same syndicated edited version that I recorded off WPSG CH 57in Philadelphia back in 1998 with Archie's great line to Harry about If Old McDonald had he not expanded farm into a fast food chain and that Cornel Sanders still would have been a private in the Army straggling chickens had he not taken a chance on his chicken joints were not included (These lines were kept in the TVLand edit in 2002). Other then that the rest of the episodes seems to be intact. Great liner notes Inside the DVD with episode credits
