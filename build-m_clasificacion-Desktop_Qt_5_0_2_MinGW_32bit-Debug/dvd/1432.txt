 Atrocious Compilation - it's of some of the worst films the Coens' did (excluding The Big Lebowksi) and does not include their most famous films. What were they thinking? It's like if they released a Spielberg Compilation but only included Catch Me If You Can, AI, Minority Report, and War of the Worlds. WTF!!!! Plus you can buy each DVD separately and come UNDER the asking price of the entire set. The BIg Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There are about 10 bucks new in most stores. Blood Simple and Int. Cruelty (which is the most UNCoen film ever) are closer to 5 in many places I've seen. So don't fall into the "compilation trap" because you are not getting a "bulk" discount. Just buy the films you want separately. Most Coen DVDs are very reasonable price wise. Any Coen compilation without Fargo, Barton Fink, and Raising Arizona is worthless. And again, you're better off spending $40 on those DVDs individually.
