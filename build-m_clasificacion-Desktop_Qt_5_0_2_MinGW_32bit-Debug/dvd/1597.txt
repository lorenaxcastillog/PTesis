 A quick tip for all readers: I love Amazon and everything, but Bestbuy.com is currently selling this DVD collection for the incredible price of $39.99, which is barely more expensive than purchasing a single season DVD. Take advantage before they realize it and hike the price way up. Mr. Show was one of my favorite shows when it was on HBO. The comedy is so strange and eccentric that it stands in a class of its own. Individually, Bob Odenkirk is a very talented comedy writer and David Cross is an equally talented stand-up comedian. Together, these two comedic minds created a unique showcase of off-beat comedy sketches. This show also introduced the world to other comedic talents such as Jack Black, Sarah Silverman and Brian Posehn. Getting all four seasons together is a great deal. You get to see how the show progressed and became more collected by the time they reached the 4th season. By that point, the comic duo had perfected their teaming and were shelling out some seriously memorable material. Great show and a great DVD collection to have
