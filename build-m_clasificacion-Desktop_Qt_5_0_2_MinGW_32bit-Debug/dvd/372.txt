 I first saw this in the theatre because I like Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson. I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of 'That 70's Show' which I never kept up with on a regular basis. I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD. Mr. Grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend. He's become such a machine in a competivie world that he's loses his way in life. I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too. One of mentor's has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life. So many things are going at once on so many levels. To me, this movie captured that. Paul Weitz did a great job writing this. The cast was exquisite
