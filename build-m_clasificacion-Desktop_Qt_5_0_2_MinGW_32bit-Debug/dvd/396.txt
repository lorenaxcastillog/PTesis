 I can't believe I'm saying this.....it's a great movie! My wife wanted to see this movie and forced me to sit there and watch it. I'm glad she did! Look I'm not saying that this is Life Is Beautiful but for what it is it's dam good! Bosworth shines radiantly (unlike the Beyond the Sea disaster). Duhammel steals every scene he's in. And Ginnifer Goodwin is OUTSTANDING in what is supposed to be a flunky role. She turns it around and is memorable as the lighthearted sidekick for Bosworth. She's extremely attractive to boot! Kind of like Jennifer Tilly with a whole lot more class and without the irritating baby voice. As for Mr. Tophar.....well.....I did find him a bit grating.....sorry. I would have preferred somebody like Toby McGuire but not enough to dimminish this fine piece of fluff. So do yourself a favor and buy it. I'm sure you'll want to see it over and over again. A winner
