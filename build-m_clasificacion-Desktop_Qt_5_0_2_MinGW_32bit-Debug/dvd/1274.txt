 I had tried one other pilates dvd and didn't like it but since I enjoyed other 10 Minute Solution dvds I thought I would give this one a try and I am so glad I did! The time flew by for each segment and I really enjoyed Lara as an instructor. You also add hand weights to some segments which is nice. In fact the only equipment needed was a carpeted floor or pilates mat, and light hand weights. Plus you are able to do this workout bare foot, a nice change of pace. My only complaint is that I could not do all the moves in the cardio segment, too advanced for me but hopefully in time I will increase my flexibiity. I highly recommend this dvd for an intro to pilates or for those already at intermediate levels. I found it relaxing but could feel the burn afterwards.
