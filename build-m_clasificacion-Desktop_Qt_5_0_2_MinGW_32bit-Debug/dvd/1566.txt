 This is one of the best movies that I've seen in years. When it first came out, for some reason I missed it or didn't think that it would be interesting. How wrong I was! Gandhi is a fascinating account of a true hero, a lawyer who tried to give Indians rights in South Africa in the late 1890s, and graduated to taking on the entire British Empire in his effort to free India from their rule in later years. I always thought of Gandhi as a pacifist but in fact he used ACTIVE resistance and noncompliance, and was willing to sacrifice himself, his family and his followers for the sake of the greater good. A sincerely noble, honorable and remarkable 20th-century hero. Beautifully filmed and very well acted. Really an inspiring movie that makes us shudder to realize the way that Indians were treated in their own country such a short period of time ago
