 Oh my gaw! That other reviewer is right - I am just so, so jellllllus of Jessica and her marriage to Nick that watching these DVDs makes me want to tear my hair out and smother my husband of six years. I yearn for the life Jessie has of being: bleach-blonde, fake-tanned, married to someone whose eyes have surprisingly not fallen out of his sockets given the amount of times he rolls them at her, and whose creepy father constantly hovers around, making comments about her sex life and (...). Oh yes, jealous I am. I am soooooooo envious! I think what I really wish I had is Jessie's intellect, ya know, that of a flea, because being stooooopid is hot, y'all. Being dumb and man-faced with (...) Oh and getting divorced after putting your marriage on the air for three years is just THE ULTIMATE cool. It's kind of like throwing out last year's fashions, you know. So if you're dying to live Jessie's life vicariously, this is the DVD for you. ENJOY
