 Most of the episodes are really good; there are a couple that are a bit stupid or boring, but that's not the fault of the animators--it's the fact that DC simply doesn't have as many good villains as Marvel, so some of the threats make you roll your eyes. Nonetheless, it's great to see the Big 7 working together. My biggest gripe would be that the Flash is portrayed as being *a lot* slower than he is/should be. There are times when villains can visually follow him or can act in advance of an attack. In fact, the Flash would have finished his attack before they even got to finish a single breath. I also prefer Kyle to John as the Green Lantern, but the overall characterization of all the characters is really good, and the stories are intelligently written. They don't dumb it down in order to appeal to very young children--someone actually got a clue and realized that kids are much smarter than people give them credit for. This is a worthwhile purchase, and I can highly recommend Justice League Unlimited Season 1, which is actually better again
