 I loved this movie! Great chemistry between the 2 lead characters and the supporting cast was very believable. This was not a "gay agenda" story - regardless of their gender, you just really wanted Luce & Rachel to be together. No overtly sexual scenes (although I agree with the reviewer who said a few more kisses between the 2 would have been nice). I disagree with the reviewer who said this movie depicted the men as "idiots". The only male character I didn't care for was Cooper (the self-proclaimed lady's man) but probably because I've known tons of men like him in real life; sometimes the truth hurts. Rachel's dad was depicted as "bumbling" but in the end, he was the character who was the most insightful, telling Rachel to follow her heart. And Heck - who didn't love Heck? This is a movie I didn't want to see end because I felt as though the characters had become my fiends. Buy it if you love a happy ending
