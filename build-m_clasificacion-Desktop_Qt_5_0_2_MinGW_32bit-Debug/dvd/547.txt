 I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother
