 Culkin(henry) does a good job portraying a scary lunatic, because he gives off a spooky air. His acting, however is very dull, and takes away from the movie. HOWEVER, Culkins dry (but convinving) performance is completely compensated for with the performance of Elijah Wood (Mark). Not only is mark the most adorable, loveable child, but his performance is jaw-dropping. The spotlight for this movie really belongs to Wood. He acts every scene out with the utmost emotion, and passion. He makes this movie one of the best. It is the battle between good (Mark) and evil (Henry). Henry plays a lunatic son, who does awful things to his family and others. Mark comes to live with Henry and his family for a while after his mom dies. Henry is Mark's cousin (too bad for Mark). Mark can see the evil lurking within henry, but can he prove it to his aunt and uncle(henry's parents) before it is too late?
