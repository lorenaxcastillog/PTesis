 I travel to Algiers many time a year for work. As a result, I visited the Algiers casbah many times and each time, as I passed in front of the house where Ali Lapointe was killed by the French, along with another man, a woman and a 10-year old boy, I was reminded I needed to see this movie. I have now seen it and I am glad for the knowledge I gained about that famous battle. I am no longer embarrassed to tell my Algerian friends that I have not seen this classic movie. Now I understand why some areas of the casbah look like they were bombed - they were. Over an above my personal appreciation of the Algiers casbah and its history, "The Battle of Algiers" is a truly good movie and it is no surprise that it won so many prizes when it came out. It is well done in all aspects and I want to watch it again. I have not watched the other CDs yet (interviews and history) but I can't wait to find the time to do it
