 There are so many editions of this movie that you may not know which to get. You would think the special or the delux editions are better. They are not. You would think they would at least be the same. Thy are not. This edition, and ironically the cheapest, has all the classic scenes without the unnecessary BS. For example, the last battle doesn't need to be 30 minutes long. The original edition is the one with Ash standing in front with the maiden at his feet on his left. At the bottom left are the little demons standing on a tire and attacking his feet. The other editions don't have the best line in movie history where Ash, after blasting a bad guy in the face says that whether he's... "Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the gun". That alone makes the original version the one and only version to get
