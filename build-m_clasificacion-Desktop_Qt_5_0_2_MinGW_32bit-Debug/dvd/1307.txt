 The thing about this video is that its based on true accounts - it's not meant to be some truely entertaining, glitzy sci-fi. Some of the special effects might seem a bit way out there, but so were the events that took place and the effect on the Striebers. I found it described the kind of mental challenge the abduction experience puts forward, how hard it is to deal with let alone understand. I see the DVD as a personal account of how one family deals with the experience - now that I've seen the DVD, I want to read all the books, Communion, Confirmation & Breakthrough etc. One thing people should have picked up is that this isn't any kind of rehashed grey alien story, nor is it over sensationalised. One thing I realy liked about the fact it was based on a true story? You can visit unknowncountry.com and find out how Whitley has dealt with his experiences and what his concerns are for all of us
