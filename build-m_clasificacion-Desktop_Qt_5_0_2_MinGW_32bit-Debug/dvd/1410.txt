 I caught one episode of this show yeeeeeeeears ago on Bravo. Didn't realize it was regular program. Just thought it was one of those offbeat Bravo things. Only saw about 20 minutes of it, but it was so freaking ODD that I remembered it. Years later, I was at my library and saw the vhs tapes for the series as I was browsing the shelves. Took them home and thoroughly enjoyed them. John Lurie is an excellent host and he picked superb guests and the vistas are incredible. And the guy who does the voiceovers? Insane. Positively insane. "Oogly boogly" is now in my permanent vocabulary. THEN, just a few years ago, I saw them on dvd and bought the set. The commentary had me CRYING with laughter. I hadn't thought the shows could be improved upon. They can. They were. This is the most hilariously twisted show I've ever seen
