 This is another programmable dvd which is really useful for those who are short for time. You can also pre-program the workouts depending on your needs as well as your level. This is the first pilates dvd I have and I find Denise's instruction very useful. In one section, she doesn't do the workouts but only instructs one lady who's doing it, while in another section, she's all by herself doing the work. She also gives pointers on things to do and to avoid. Personally, I do all the 3 ab workouts since this is my problem area, while doing away the lower body workouts if I don't have time. During weekends and I wake up early, I do the whole workout, including the 15-minute pilates challenge. The challenge is a standing all-body workout which is really great! The background is a plus, it's nice and relaxing! Indeed, an excellent addition to your workout dvds
