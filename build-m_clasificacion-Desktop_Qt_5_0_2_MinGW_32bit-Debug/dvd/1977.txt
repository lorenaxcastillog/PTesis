 This is a fairly fast-paced DVD that does what it says it will do - cover the essentials to better bowling. It's a nice DVD to refresh everyone on the basics. No matter what level you perform at, you always need to review the fundamentals and that's where this comes in handy. It's easy to watch and easy to follow. Beginners probably get the most out of this DVD and will want to watch it several times prior to practice and then watch it after practice to help assess your strengths and the areas that need some improvement. The rating is based on the fact that the content matches the title and purpose of the DVD. This is not something that an advanced bowler would have at the top of their purchase list, but again, it's a nice review of fundamentals that remain key to everyone's game. The material is presented by two of the most knowledgeable bowlers in the sport. It is a bit pricey, but the price is probably appropriate for its small market focus
