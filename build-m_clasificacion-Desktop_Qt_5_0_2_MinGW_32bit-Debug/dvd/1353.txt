 This video has been a staple of my home exercise library for years and it's the one I keep going back to. I used to do it with wrist and ankle weights, and jumping (Kathy calls it "propulsion") at every opportunity - let me tell you, that was an intense cardio workout! It kept me in great shape and I loved the results. Now that I am 17 weeks pregnant with my first baby, this is still my favorite fitness video, except I do the low-impact beginner variations of every routine. Hands down, it beats every other pregnancy fitness video I've tried. (Note: I do not do the floor exercises on this DVD now that I am pregnant.) I recommend for anyone of any fitness level in order to feel great and get results. Exercise sessions are broken out well so you can cut out a segment if you don't have time. Kathy has great cueing and it's easy to follow: not as choreography-intensive as some other step videos. Enjoy!
