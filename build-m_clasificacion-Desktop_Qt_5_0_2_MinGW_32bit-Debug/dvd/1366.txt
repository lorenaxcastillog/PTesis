 I first saw this movie with my son about 15 years ago, and was amazed at the originality of the storyline, cinematography, and fantastic characters. My son just loved the movie and watched it over and over again. I couldn't help but love the movie, and watch it with him, it just always caught my attention. To this day, I still love this movie. Though they have come out with parts two and three, this one is my favorite of them all. And thankfully no other film-makers have tried to copy the idea, because it would flop if they did, you just can't top this story. When my children grow up and have their own, I'll be watching it with my grandchildren too! Jim Henson had a hand in this movie, so understandably, some of the characters are very well done by him. This movie is just a pure classic, and always will be, it cannot be outdone! It's a wonderful fantasy, for children and parents alike
