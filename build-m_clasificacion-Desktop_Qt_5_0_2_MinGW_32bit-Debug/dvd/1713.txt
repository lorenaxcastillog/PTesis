 Now in this movie, the director decided to focus on van damme's actin abilites. ???????? It's ok though, he gets by. Not very good acting by any means, but I would put him over some one like dmx or some of these non movie stars trying to be in movies today. I can only give it a 3.5/5 at best, but it got really gory and the movie was all the better for it. What do you expect when you are dealing with gangsters? If the very end was a little stronger and the action was filmed a bit better, I would probably say it was a great movie. Sorry not to give anything away, but it is the first time I have ever been able to recommend a van damme movie and want you to go experience it for yourself. The picture is very clear, sound quality in 5.1 is pretty good, and while the music isn't the greatest, just like the movie, it is pretty good. And the making of featurette is, well, interesting.
