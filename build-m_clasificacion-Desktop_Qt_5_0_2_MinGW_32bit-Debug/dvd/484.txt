 Just a note to wholeheartedly agree with Archmaker "GEO" and ask Mr. Lyons from Reno what film he watched. As an emergency physician for the last twenty years, The Hospital is, of course, one of my favorite films, and as a part-time screenwriter, Paddy Chayefsky is perhaps my favorite scribe. This film nails not only the lunatic, out-of-control atmosphere one can experience in a large hospital, but the dialouge is precious and its medical veracity reaches levels rarely heard in Hollywood. The off handed remarks about " a sedated body lying around in radiology for five hours wouldn't be unusual" or patients being "forgotten to death" or the "victim of the great American plague, vestigial identity" are more true than even Mr. Cheyevsky could know. This film is not a video pin-up of Ms. Rigg, although her comfortable-with-my-nuttiness demeanor plays the perfect foil to Scott's cantankerous Dr. Bock. And let's change the Chayefsky triple crown to a grand slam with the edition of Marty, his other Oscar winner. I love this film, which is as relevant today as it was 35 years ago
