 The BBC's version of the Office is a refreshing, intelligent depiction of today's business environment. Laced with sarcasm and gags that are so astounding they defy comprehension, it is worth suspening disbelief for optimal enjoyment! David Brent's portrayal of the idiot boss is genius. And his supporting characters - namely Gareth and Tim, are wonderful. After working in a corporation for many years, I could identify with many of the issues that arose and wish that I was able to respond in the ways that these characters respond. One takeaway, which I consider a serious one, is that honesty is underrated. Brent repeatedly puts his foot in his mouth for the things he says and many times, it's embarrassing to watch. But the beauty of Brent is his honesty and it makes his obnoctiousness tolerable. He tells it like it his, albiet distorted, but you always know where he stands (or is trying to stand!). Two thumbs way up for this box set which cleverly combined sharp wit with doses of reality. Loved the ending too
