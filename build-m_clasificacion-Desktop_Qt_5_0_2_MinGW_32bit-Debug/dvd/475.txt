 I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, "when am I going to laugh?" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison
