 Wow--how did this one fall through the cracks? Maybe it was well-publicized and I just missed the publicity, but I hadn't even heard of it until I saw it in our public library, and I figured I'd give it a shot. It looked cute, like something my young daughter (4 yrs old) would like. Was I pleasantly surprised!! This movie is absolutely hilarious, but not in the slapstick, in-your-face style like The Incredibles or Shrek. This movie is chock-full of dry wit and sarcasm that works really well. The best part is that my daughter loved it just as much as my wife and I, but for totally different reasons. It's cute and has incredible graphics, which kept our daughter entertained, and it has mild adult-type humor thrown in, in very subtle places. It has gotten better the 2nd and 3rd times we've watched it, because we found that we caught some funny comments and innuendos that we had missed before (nothing that you wouldn't want your kids to hear, just good clean humor). i highly recommend this movie for kids and adults both (I've actually watched it all the way through by myself!)
