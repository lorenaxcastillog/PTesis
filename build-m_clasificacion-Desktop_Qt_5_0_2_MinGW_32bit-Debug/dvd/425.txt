 From the description on the DVD jacket I thought this was going to be a boring movie, but I was wrong. I was pleasantly surprised with the film. I immediately cared about the main character, Anthony Mackie. There's just something about him that made that role come alive. I could feel him, his anger, and his pain. He wasn't flaming (not that anything is wrong with that), but he was just a man. An honest, non-stereotypical black gay man. The first intimate scene was exactly what I was expecting when I saw Brokeback Mountain, but was disappointed with. It wasn't raw, it wasn't too much, it was just enough. This movie made it authentic, but even more important than that were the 'flashbacks,' which really pulled me in and kept my attention. It was wonderful to see the portrayals of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston. I'd never even heard of "Fire" magazine before. Interesting, entertaining, very creative and inspiring is what this film was. The ending was slightly predictable (at least to me), but it didn't take away from the movie at all. I'd recommend it...especially if you're a lover of literature and the arts.
