 We have watched all of the movies in this collection. Some of the movies (about 1/3) are either inaudible (hard to understand what the actors are saying) and/or skip parts (words/scenes) because the film is so old. My husband and I watched at least 3 of the movies per week, and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this "horror" collection are nowhere near the "horror" movies we watched on Saturday Matinees at the movies in the 60s. Over half belong in the "mystery" or "comedy" category. And what's with all the gorillas? Every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it. These horror movies are from the 20s to the 60s and are much more tame than todays horror flicks, granted. But, come on, why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie? Again, there were too many gorillas! Not that there's anything wrong with gorillas, but we prefer ghosts to gorillas.
