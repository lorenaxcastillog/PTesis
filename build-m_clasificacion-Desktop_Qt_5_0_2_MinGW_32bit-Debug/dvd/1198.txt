 I really believe that this is the best story ever told on film. I have watched many movies in my lifetime, and none have been close to as powerful or as moving as this one. This film has some of the best acting I've ever seen, specifically from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and James Whitmore. Normally when I watch a movie, I like to root for the bad guys, but this is one of the only movies where I truly feel for the characters involved and I desperately hope for them to have a good outcome. The twists and turns are truly amazing, and the ending will leave you breathless. The quality on the DVD is superb, and they even fixed a goof at the end of the film, regarding the placement of a "wound", just for this DVD release. There are some great extras such as commentaries, behind the scenes documentaries, a 20 minute spoof of the movie, trailers, and some other things that make this set well worth the money. I cannot stress how great this movie is, and how it's a *must own* for anyone looking to start a respectable DVD collection
