 This movie is an excellent satire of the 1992 Democratic Presidential Primaries. John Travolta and Emma Thompson nail (pardon the pun) Bill and Hillary Clinton with their performances as Jack and Susan Stanton, a governor from a small southern state and his overly ambitious wife. It's worth watching for Kathy Bates' perfomance alone. Bates deserved the Oscar (she was nominated.) Her comic/tragic performance is one of the best supporting performances captured on film. The character of Henry Burton is a little flat, but not because of Adrian Lester's lack of trying, he just isn't given much to work with. He is the only normal character in a sea of eccentrics, and thus isn't allowed to shine. The movie is faithful to the novel of the same name by noted political writer, Joe Klein. The rest of the supporting cast are equally great, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the James Carville-esque consultant. Larry Hagman also turns in a touching performance. This movie and the novel are musts for every political junkie
