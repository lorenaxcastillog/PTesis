 First, I must say that I found FACING WINDOWS (or "La Finestra di fronte") deeply affecting. It combines elements of history, suspense, romance, and sentimentality in a very polished and effective fashion. In fact, because of its sentimental heart, I would say that the film is quintessentially Italian, except the writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek is Turkish. I appreciated the layers of storyline that Ozpetek created, and the film has such a lush sheen, it makes lower-middle class Italian life look pretty good. In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much, here's how far I have to stoop to find something to criticize: Why do marketers insist on giving movies asinine taglines? In this film's case it is: "Desire has no bounds." This is so stupid, it would have put me off the movie had I been aware of it beforehand. (End of needless tirade.) SIDELIGHT: The actor who plays the WWII survivor, Massimo Girotti, passed away shortly after the film's completion
