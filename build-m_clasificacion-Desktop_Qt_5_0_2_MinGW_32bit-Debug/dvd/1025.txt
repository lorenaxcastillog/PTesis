 Back in 1933, this was a huge hit: moviegoers rushed to see two of Hollywood's most popular stars co-cast in a musical comedy-drama! Crawford plays beautiful Janie Barlow, an ambitious dancer who wants to rise to the top with class and dignity. As Patch Gallagher, the show director, Gable plays it rough and sexy: the two generate a lot of electrical currents together and their off-Screen attraction for each other is quite obviously evident. The original story for this film - which introduced the Three Stooges to film - was a serial published in THE SATURDAY EVENING POST. Gable was supposedly ill during production due to a leg condition known then as "toxic leg": he had an appendectomy.....As "punishment" for holding up the production, Louis B. Mayor later loaned him out to Columbia for IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. But Gable got the last laugh: he won the Oscar! Some sources state the reason for the above scenerio was Gable's refusal to do another "tough guy" role. Who knows? THE RHYTHM OF THE DAY sequence is brilliantly imaginitive. This film served as the film debut of a 35 year-old hoofer. His name was Fred Astaire
