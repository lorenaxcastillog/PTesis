 I have an engineering background and prefer science fiction and high action movies to stories like Wicker Park. I don't even know what made me buy it, but I did. First and foremost, I have a friend (guy) who is an INFP (if you study Myers Brigg). Anyway, his personal story was so similar to this movie! I'm constantly asking this guy what his problem is, well, some people just believe in love. I just want to say that I now understand my friends point of view about the woman he once knew. I'm not saying I find logic in my friends circumstance...I just understand that situation better. The movie was mysterious and intrigueing and the actors are far more talented than the ones in the most recent remake of "Pride and Prejudice", I do suggest "Wicker Park". On another note...if you want to see a good version of "Pride and Prejudice", get the one with Colin Firth.
