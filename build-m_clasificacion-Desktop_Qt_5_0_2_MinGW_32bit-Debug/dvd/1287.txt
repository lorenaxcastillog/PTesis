 This movie is silly at best, racist at worse. I can't believe Ice Cube actually wrote the script for this mess. My opinion of Ice Cube has been drastically lowered. It's the old black jiving and shucking all over again. This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: "nobody in here but us chickens." There's no plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, "Dude, you been knocked out!" That's a typical "joke" from this movie. How about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog? Hilarious---Not. After watching this dvd with my family, we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene, and we couldn't think of a single one.
