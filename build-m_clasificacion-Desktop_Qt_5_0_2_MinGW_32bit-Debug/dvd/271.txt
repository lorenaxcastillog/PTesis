 15 Minutes is worth the money. It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time. This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life. We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today. At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed. He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world. The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them. All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money.
