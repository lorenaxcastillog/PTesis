 I first saw the film in theaters and have seen it several times since. It is still breathtaking and rivals the newer nature films created for the big screen. The movie contains drama, comic relief, action and sadness. All the emotions that surround the situation of most of the planets large predators. The film is appropriate from elementary students (there is one scene where you see the main characters cheeks, however)to adults. Some might call part of the story slow, but it reflects life. Parts of life are not high action scenes. The main character performs a neat experiment testing the observed diet of the wolves illustrating parts of the scientific method. One could have a good classroom discussion over this portion of the movie alone. The music is was wonderful and put a memorable sound of the Arctic in my mind. For the price the movie is an ecological must.
