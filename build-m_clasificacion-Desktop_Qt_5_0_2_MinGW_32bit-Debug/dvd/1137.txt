 After catching 2 episodes on PBS, I bought the DVD set in order to view the entire documentary. I'm glad I own the discs because I have now shown it to at least 9 politically active Blue-State (Chicago) liberal friends who now have an entirely different outlook on complexities of economics and capitalism. Viewing all 6 hours simply is a short class that fosters a newfound respect for the long-term thinking exhibiting by Reagan, Thatcher, etc. The political risks that pro-free-market leaders take is seen when simplistic protestors take to the streets, unable to see beyond their immediate political agendas. I also have a new admiration for PBS in producing this honest assessment of the battle of ideas over the past half century. I've seen the reaction of the CPB/PBS adherents, who have come to expect PBS to tow the line of neo-socialism; it is hard to believe even after looking at the negative results of central planning and the success of freedom-born free markets, anyone could still maintain such Hobbesian thinking
