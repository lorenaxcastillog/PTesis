 Although I had about half of these movies from collections I bought from DVD bargain bins, the price was very reasonable to justify getting about 25 new horror classics added to my collection. With the DVD market collapsing, I doubt that we will see such a collection of forgotten classics ever again. I finished watching the first disc, and I would say that 2 of the 4 films on it are considered great ("Carnival of Souls" and "Nightmare Castle"). Even the other 2 ("Creature from the Haunted Sea" and "Atom Age Vampire") have more than enough entertainment value to keep you watching until the end. Sure, the picture quality and the synchronizatio of audio is not 100%, but considering the target market and the budget, this is a reasonable tradeoff. The great thing about these forgotten classics is that I am discovering films that I have never heard of, and I would argue that they are better than the more modern horror movies
