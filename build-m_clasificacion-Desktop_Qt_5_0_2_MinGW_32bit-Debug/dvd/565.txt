 For the fans of Warner Bros. animation,here is another great collection of the studio's Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies,presented in the films' original form. Not those mutilated Blue Ribbon re-issues that A.A.P.(Associated Artists Productions) further mutilated. A.A.P. carefully ruined many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons as well. Again,you'll see your favorite WB cartoon stars Bugs Bunny,Daffy Duck,Porky Pig,Elmer Fudd,Yosemite Sam,Sylvester,Tweety,Foghorn Leghorn,Pepe Le Pew,Speedy Gonzales,Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner tickling your funny bones with their zany madness. If not already,Turner Classic Movies should air these cartoons since Cartoon Network currently isn't. However,some cartoons will probably never appear on future sets since television mogul Ted Turner,owner of the Atlanta-based TCM,CN,TBS Superstation and Turner Network Television,continued the ban on certain shorts from television and video when he purchased the shorts from A.A.P.,a subsequent owner. Possibly,Turner will reconsider. These shorts contained situations found offensive by African-Americans and Orientals,respectively. However,to have such shorts in your personal collection is no big deal. I have a VHS tape with short subject cartoons that were either never aired on television or were before and later banned. Anyway,for all the WB cartoon conisseurs,enjoy this collection and anticipate the arrival of Volume 5
