 What a treat this twenty-five year retrospective was (even with clunkers like I Know What I Want and Gonna Raise Hell, which they just did on Music For Hangovers!) Robin is great here and they even did a song from his outstanding 'Robin Zander' solo release, "Time Will Let You Know'; The Tricksters pull out all the stops here - Jon Brant makes a very fine return and sounds better on Bass than ever! But why couldn't he play on 'Take Me To The Top' and 'Tonight It's You'? No matter, also: the "Cheap Kids", Miss Holland Zander and Dax Nielsen sound/play great here as well. The Woke Up With A Monster title cut is here (for better or worse) and some of the other cuts really don't fit that well, but it's a small complaint for the joy of seeing these guys in front in front of a pakced house again, eh? Thanks: Jon, Robin, Dax, Rick, Billy Corgan (Squashing Pumpkins), Tom, Bun E., Miss Zander, the Harlem High [Rockford, Ill.]choir, et, al for a great show that will only get better with time!
