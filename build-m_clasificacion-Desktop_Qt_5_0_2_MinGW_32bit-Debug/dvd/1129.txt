 Well, here's a movie I didn't want to see at all (I loathe basketball), but I enjoyed it very much. Two actors to watch who are very charismatic - Leon and Tupac Shakur (whose murder robbed the screen of a very fine talent). The former exudes a quiet power reminiscent of Lawrence Fishberne; the latter has amazing eyes with incredibly curly lashes. Another note: I haven't seen a movie that looked this sharp and clear, whose colors were crisp and bright, in many a year. And the basketball shots during the "tournament"! Wow! What editing! Whoever did that really knew his stuff. The story was fairly hokey - good guy, bad guy, competing for the young basketball whiz, and fairly predictable. I did think his overblown jealousy of his mom dating Leon a little too too. But Shakur's portrayal of the local king-pin was very effective. He actually seemed friendly and OK, but the menace below was subtly done. I have seen him before in "Poetic Justice".
