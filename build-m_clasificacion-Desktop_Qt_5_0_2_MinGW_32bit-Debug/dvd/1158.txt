 This movie is a must for any fan of Lucille Ball's work. Especially those who have only seen her masterful comedic talents. "Stone Pillow" was a chance for her to show her dramatic acting chops -- and boy does she have them! This 80's TV movie was probably one of the first to tell the story of the homeless, and it was also one of Lucy's last roles. I had seen this on TV, and taped it; but for some reason or other I probably hadn't viewed it in close to a decade. I was thrilled when the DVD came out. The quality of the image and sound are probably close to what you'd find on other TV movies of its age. It's far better than the one I taped off TV in the early 90's. While not overly gritty, the film tries to show the reality of a bag woman, and I think it succeeds. It's a real treat to watch Lucille Ball shine in the role of Florabelle, and I recommend this DVD to all of her fans.
