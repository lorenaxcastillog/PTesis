 Fuu, Mugen, and Jin... we meet again. This time around the gang is in for some revalations of sorts. You find out a bit about Mugen's Past in the first 2 episodes and a little more about Fuu's facination with the "samurai who smells of sun flowers". I'd have to say my favorite of the 4 has got to be "Bogus Booty". The gang comes into some money and while Fuu stuffs her face (typical for her since all she seems to do is eat and complain), the guys decide to hit the local red light district. You can imagine the sort of things they get into. I won't give away any details, except that it involves a couple of nice fight sequences. I gave it a 4 out of 5 only because its not the best of the series but its not the worst either. If you have liked the first 3 dvd's u love this one too
