 It is a bit strange to watch all this fight against Dan Brown's book. What is for? Millions people who like the Da Vinci Code book usually do not take it as a source of historical facts. The value of this book is not in the particular facts but in general (and serious) idea about danger of destroying male-female balance in society. Indeed, a human being consists of two parts. Males and females have very different views on this World so that these views should be well balanced. If one of the parts becomes heavily predominating, it may be truly dangerous for survival of our species. Dan Brown just takes our attention to the problem. He shows that the imbalance has a long history and it might be a major source of many current problems in human society as well as the source of overall instability on the Earth. And the latter is not fiction.
