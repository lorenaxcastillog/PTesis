 A part of this video was available through our cable company on demand. I got tired of watching the other programs my son always seemed to choose (over and over again) so I put this on hoping it'd be some good. My son loved it! He loved it so much I had to purchase it because he'd ask for it all day long and they'd taken it off cable. Someone had commented their daughter didn't like it and she was disappointed. This video is an educational video. It's not a tv show like Jay Jay the jet plane. It's a way for you to educate your child about whatever they enjoy, that's what the Big Adventure series is. If you've ever owned a video from Small-Fry you'd know that. It's a great alternative for people like me who'd prefer to educate their child instead of just letting them mindlessly watch cartoons over and over again. My son loves this video as well as the Big Train Trip. I'm going to try the construction video and the fire station video. I hope my son enjoys them as well as this one and the Big Plane Trip.
