 Thanks to Sofa/GoodTimes for doing up this set the right way. So many variety shows presented us with great entertainment during the golden era of television. Yet, I know of very few which are available in their entirety on DVD! The majority of nods to this genre are done in a "Best Of" edited format. This is not the way the shows were meant to be seen, and certainly not the way I want to watch them. (This carries over to numerous genres, as well. I don't want a DVD of World Series highlights. I want the whole games!) Sofa/GoodTimes has maintained these four shows intact, including both the good and the bad acts....and even including the commercials!!! They should be congratulated for the former and applauded for the latter. The video varies in quality. But one must remember that these shows weren't preserved in the same manner as "I Love Lucy", and thus, can't be expected to be pristine. Now if only someone would issue full episodes of "The Hollywood Palace"
