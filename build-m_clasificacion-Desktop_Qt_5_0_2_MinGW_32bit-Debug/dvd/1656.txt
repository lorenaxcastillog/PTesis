 If this movie were set in the US, I would've given it 1 star but the British accent, humor, and colloquialisms partially saved it...but not enough, sorry to say! Why not? Because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there, this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth: the desperately lonely and insecure 30-something single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a Mr. Right. Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing. Almost from the first 5 minutes, this movie just reeks of focus-group-inspired audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled TV-sitcom bits. Was there even ONE half-original character in this whole movie? Don't remember any...maybe because I'd like to forget this dreadful cringe-fest of a flick ASAP
