 The Man With No Name Trilogy is the best way to get all the Clint Eastwood you can handle. As I have reviewed the films before in VHS I will focus on the extras. While there are not a lot they do have some interesting ones. For example, the disc holding The Good, The Bad And The Ugly includes deleted scenes from the original Italian release. That means that all the scenes are still in Italian, which is kind of cool. There is also text extras on the same disc dealing with behind the scenes information. A Fistful Of Dollars can be viewed in either letterbox or full screen and all the discs have the movie trailers. If you already have the tapes, unless you can find this set cheap or are slowly replacing your tapes with DVDs like I am, the extras don't seem worth dishing out the money to get the discs.
