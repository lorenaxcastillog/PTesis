 This is one of the most amazing thrillers I've ever seen. I love a good thriller and this is by far one of the best. It is well acted, and gets you within the first 10 -15 minutes. Once it has you, it doesn't let up for the entire length thereafter. I love Kurt Russell and he's so good in this (He was also good in Unlawful Entry which was another fantastic thriller). The only trouble I have with this, is that it's always on TV right before I'm about to do a drive from LA to Vegas and it's all too close for comfort. J T Walsh was also great in this. He was pure evil but also really convincing. You have to see this movie. I know that is a cliche but this is true. This is such a great thriller, so all thriller fans watch this now if you haven't already seen it, but just make sure that you go for a pee first
