 Between CSI Miami and this, the original series, I think that this series wins hands down. I remember first seeing Petersen (Gil Grissom) in Manhunter (the first movie based on Thomas Harris' book the Red Dragon and the perfect movie adaptation of that book) when he was quite a bit younger and thinner but it is not his leading man qualities that make him so appealing. The writers/producers/directors of this series manage to recreate some of the things that make British crime dramas so fascinating-- they 1) don't pull away from the dark to contrive a happy ending; 2)they don't hesitate to portray the lead characters as vulnerable and "strange"; and 3) they look for really great faces, not conventionably pretty or ugly actor, for the parts. Sure, it's science fantasy in the sense that things don't happen in real life the way they happen in the CSI lab, and it's not great art, but its a great way to pass time
