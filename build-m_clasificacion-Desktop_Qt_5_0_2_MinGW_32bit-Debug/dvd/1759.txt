 I being fairly new to the White Stripes scene, saw them play for the first time on one of the awards shows which I believe was the MTV music awards 2004. I became interested and intrigued by the two person raw energy rock blast. I found this DVD to be an untamed electric charge of raw pure white hot plasma, just like the duo who is the White Stripes. For two people they sure make a lot of music. Completely ingrossing and utterly enjoyable. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The only thing I did not like was the fuzzy style camera filter{which personally I do not enjoy}, I would think that having a clear and many angled focus, would have been much better. I'm not saying this fuzzy filter did not fit the Stripes style, but as a director its a move I would not have made. Minus one star for the cam work.Great music, great show. I like the White Hot Stripes.
