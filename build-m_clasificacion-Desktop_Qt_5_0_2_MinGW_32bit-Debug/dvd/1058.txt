 "So sue me...I like to have fun while giving to charity!" - David Brent "Who says famine has to be depressing?" - David Brent I am an American. I love America. I dearly love Michael Scott. However, the British originals are easily 1000 times more funny. Ricky Gervais is quite literally the funniest man on the planet. That is not hyperbole! Content that is acceptable on British television would not even play at 10 PM in the US. Thus, you adults that enjoy adult humor can look forward to darker writing and biting sarcasm. Did I mention this is an adult comedy? Make no mistake - Ricky Gervais IS my favorite character EVER!!!! So David Brent over Michael Scott. However, I'd easily pick Dwight over Gareth. But, I'd pick Tim over Jim though. Pam over Dawn. I like the English Jan (forgot her name) over the American Jan but I love them both. Have I lost you? Watch and you'll thank me! Oh yeah! Watch for the Saturday Night Fever performance. Excellent dancing! *** This is the best comedy surprise you could give anyone! They will thank you and sign your praises publicly.
