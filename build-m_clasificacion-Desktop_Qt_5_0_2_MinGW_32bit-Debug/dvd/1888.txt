 The ice bowl is the first football game I have clear memory of. This tape,which is very well done, sets s up the game by showing what happened the year before in the championship game in Dallas,and how the Cowboys were ready to avenge that loss. Also, juxtaposed nicely, are the story of the 1967 packers, in the final year of their glory under Vince Lombardi. The tape brings the voice of Ray Scott,longtime voice of the packers and the NFL before the corporate suits took over the broadcast booth with ex jocks. The the game itself is shown virtually in its entirity, with clever voiceover by Scott sounding very much .like it did that day. With the temperature being -16 below zero, the players and fans literally were trying to survive as well as win. This is the best of the NFL tapes that I have seen,perhaps because of the seminal importance of the game,or simply for nostalgic reasons. Either way, this is an excellent tape and a good bargain,considering that you are likely to re-watch a sports tape. And, listening to the voice of the great Ray Scott is a distinct pleasure
