 When my DVD arrived yesterday I could not wait to take it home and watch it. I saw it when it originally came out in the 60s and I remember being shocked by the gritty black and white photography and the content. This was heady stuff for Atlanta. Robert Blake's performance haunts me to this day, so many years later. As I watched it last night I marveled at the photography, lighting, acting, writing. While only Mr. Forsyth and Mr. Blake are household names today, the other actors and actresses were perfectly cast. The performances are outstanding. I wish someone would bring this glorious masterpiece to the big screen again so the younger generation can enjoy it as we did so long ago. Perhaps they will order the DVD from Amazon.com and see for themselves what I am talking about. Truman Capote at his most brilliant. Robert Blake at his peak. Fascinating piece of film work
