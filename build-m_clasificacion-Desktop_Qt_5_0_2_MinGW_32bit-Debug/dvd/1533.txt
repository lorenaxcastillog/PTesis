 This movie is absolutely wonderful! It has such heart! Such a tear-jerker! It's just beautiful! It brings out the animal lover in all of us while watching it. And if you have ever had a pet in your life, you can totally relate to the love shared between Jill and Joe. Charlize Theron was just amazing! You can totally feel the bond and love between her and Joe. She was so protective of Joe as he was for her! There is so much to love about this movie but I especially love the part where Jill and Joe have their justice near the end of the movie after the terrible tragedy that they both share and witness in the beginning of the film. Very well done! This was a beautifully done remake! The special effects of Joe are absolutely amazing! I am so glad I saw it on the big screen and added it to my DVD collection!
