 I find most of Denise Austin's workouts to be geared to beginners but I have a feeling a beginner would have a hard time with this one. The weight training segments are more beginner orientated but the cardio parts really get your heart pumping! A couple of them (the plyo moves of cross country skiing and the downhill skiing section)have you anxious for the end of the intervals! The weight traing segments are welcome breathers! I really liked the warmup in this workout as it seemed to get you warmed up faster and was more to the point than a lot of other workouts. Denise uses a step for some things, which I can't use as my knee hurts when I do , so I do everything on the floor and still get a great workout. I would consider myself an advanced exerciser, running in the warmer months and working out to videos in colder weather and this is one of my favorite tapes for cardio. It's not filled with a bunch of dance moves that I have a hard time following but just serious moves that get the heart going
