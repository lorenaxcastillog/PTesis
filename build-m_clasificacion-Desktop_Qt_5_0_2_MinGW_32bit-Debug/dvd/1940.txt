 It's how many years later? and I still seek to find any DVD's available for this program. Somehow I relate to each character and the lifestyle they lived. For my birthday, my husband drove me to Roslyn, Washington where the show was filmed to see what it looked like. The whole town looked exactly like it did in the show. Even the people there were warm and friendly, just living life. In this season, my favorite episode of all time "Hello, I love you" aired. I was pregnant with my child and if given a chance to experience what Shelly did, I would have given my right arm. Again, I can connect with what's going on. Today, I find solace in watching those episodes and find comfort in old friends. Last on the list to come out is Season 6. I'll be signed up the minute it becomes available. So go watch and reminisce
