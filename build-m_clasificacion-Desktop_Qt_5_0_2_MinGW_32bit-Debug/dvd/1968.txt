 Agree totally with the reviews which claim excellent playing. But, when, oh when will producers try and at least act like music lovers as opposed to trying tio impress with every damn angle they can find? On this particular dvd one is actually treated to viewing the back of some members of the audience's head; then of cousre we must not forget that all of us absolutely love seeing guitar players from the rear, behind their arms, the drummer from ground zero postion, from behind his drum kit, etc, etc. The day a producer locates a decent wide-angle camera and tries to position himself in the centre of the audience in a slightly raised vantage point and helps us view the show as if we were sitting in the centre, taking in as much of the four, five or six members at once the happier I will be. I am not really interested to watch the audience either when Steve or Larry are in the middle of a solo. Get real guys!
