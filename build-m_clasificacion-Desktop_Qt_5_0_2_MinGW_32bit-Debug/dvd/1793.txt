 Hello, all of you "A-Team"'ers out there :) I bought this set when Season 1 was released as a "blind-buy" purchase, having never seen this series when it aired in the 80's or in syndication (I know...hard to believe...:) ) I bought the set in memory of my Dad who watched this show after he was retired from his job. I remember laughing at Dad when he told me he never missed this show. Now, the laugh's on me :) I love this series! Amazing...plus I've had the cool experience of watching these eps for the 1st time on DVD. Currently, I'm viewing Season 3. Season 4's in the mail. I've heard some forum talk that Season 5 wasn't up to speed compared to the previous 4 seasons. So, I'm not certain I'll gamble on Season 5 yet. I haven't noticed any difference between S1 thru S3; I've loved every episode of the ones I've seen up to this point. Be that as it may, "The A-Team Rocks" :) (Hard to believe a "Baby Boomer" said that, right?) :
