 The first time I watched In Good Company I said to myself, eh not good, not bad, just pretty average. A couple reviews reflect that. But ever since HBO started playing the movie constantly I find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more. The best quality about this film is that it's real. You watch the story progress and you feel like you're watching reality. I never found myself saying, how unrealistic, that could never happen. The character's emotions seem real, the situations seem real. That all points to a well-acted, well-written film. Also, the movie doesn't try too hard. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, doesn't go out of its way to give you a sappy, predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with. Just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of Hollywood fantasy
