 I used to watch this show as a child at my grandmothers house and my parents (who basicly lack any sense of humor) hated it. I bought this DVD set as soon as it came out and I absolutely love it. This was by far one of the funniest shows of the 80's. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people just didn't get it. Especially the people at ABC who canned the show after only two seasons. After reading the large ammount of positive reviews on this site, it's appearent that ABC had a hit they never supported. Fortunately, both seasons are now on DVD in excellent quality. Pick them both up and you won't be dissapointed. By the way, I gave this DVD 4 stars because it lacks any sort of Closed Captioning or sub titles. If thoes features were present, it would be 5 stars all the way
