 This is a great way to get a the Disney shorts for the Holidays, but you may be buying the stories multiple times. Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol are also on the DVD Snowed in at the House of Mouse. I prefer House of Mouse even with the extra narration tying in the cartoons because it also has one of the Donald on Ice cartoons. Small one is nice, but sad and is also on included on another DVD as a special feature. Disney is releasing their cartoons on multiple DVDs at the same time and it is easy to buy short DVDs like this one and find out later that all the cartoons are already on a larger compilation. As an earlier review said, "Mickey's Christmas Carol" is already on 2 other DVDs. Still, if you want a particular cartoon and not all of them, this is a good way to go
