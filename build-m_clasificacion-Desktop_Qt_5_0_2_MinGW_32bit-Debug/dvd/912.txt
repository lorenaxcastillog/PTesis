 I came across this name of the movie when I went to a Deaf History tour at University of Iowa library last Feb., otherwise, I wouldn't have known about this movie. I wrote down the name of the movie, so I can find the movie to see it and came across Amazon.com that are selling one on DVD with closed-captioned which was a plus. Since I know sign language, it was very interesting to see a big change from the signs in the movie during 1948 to the same words comparing to now in 2006. I can see most of them are different and a couple of them like 'thank you' are still the same. I guess time have changed from 'old-fashioned' signs to 'modernized and simple' signs. It would be interesting if I could talk to Jane Wyman herself in today's sign language and see if she can understand some or not. I wonder if she knows some or have forgotten completely? It was an enjoyable movie with excellent acting by Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres (bless his heart!). I'm sure I will watch the movie again later
