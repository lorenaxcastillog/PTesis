 I just received the Robben Ford DVD yesterday. I've been a fan of Robben's for over twenty years. He's done stints as a guitarist with Jimmy Witherspoon, Charlie Musselwhite, Joni Mitchell, the Yellowjackets and the great Miles Davis, to name a few. As a guitarist myself, I am awed by his talent and musicality. He is often labeled as a fusion guitarist, which is somewhat of a misnomer. While quite fluent in the jazz medium he is at heart a bluesman. Once again this DVD is taken from the Ohne Filter German Televison show. The mixing and sound quality is great. Robben uses his band The Blue Line here. It is a trio consisting of Roscoe Beck on bass and Tom Brecchtlein on drums. Both are superb musicians. The show is from 93.Robbens playing is incredible and incedniary. His voice while not quite on a par with his playing is pleasant and easy to listen to. My only complaint is It's a bit short, just eight songs but still well worth the price of the DVD. If you are a fan of postmodern urban blues, this DVD is a must have
