 I loved this movie. The story focuses on a group of 4 friends who study in a catholic school and are troublemakers . they are in constant fight with the school nun (jodie foster)and plan on some mischiefe against her. Along the story we get to know Margie (jena malone), who fransis falls in love with and we get to know what secret margie hides. The boys also write a secret comic book in which each one of them is a hero, fighting against nun-zilla (the nun). THe movie has anime parts in it which show the story in the boys' eyes. The main plot is that the boys want to bring a cougar to the nun's office and try to break in the zoo, which leads to tragedy. There are various mentions of William Blake in the movie as the boys are Blake fans. The acting in the movie is great and very realistic, except for Jodie foster who doesn't give a real feeling of the character. But in whole its a wonderful movie you should watch
