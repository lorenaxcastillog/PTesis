 This is a fun concert. Lots of songs from Blessed Hellride, great audio and video. I could have done wihout the computer effects stuff, but it's not that annoying. Zakks playing is AWESOME man!!! I don't know how the guy can drink that much beer and still practice and not get lazy but he is 100% on it. I have not seen him play better and thats saying something. The backstage stuff is cool and gives an idea as to how much and what the guy practices. There is a killer part where he is shredding in a warm up room and analysing EVH solo's. I noticed Zakk tapped alot more on this DVD, so I'm guessing he's been into VH lately which is cool in my opionion since Van Halen is my favorite band of all time. James Lomenzo is also killer...it's too bad he isn't with them anymore because he fit in appearance and style. Thats it...great concert. Because of this DVD, I'm planning on traveling a long way to go see these guys. PS: by the new BLS album if you haven't already.
