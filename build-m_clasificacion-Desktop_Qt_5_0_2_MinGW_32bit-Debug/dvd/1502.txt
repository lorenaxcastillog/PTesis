 I grew up with this movie, and as long as you can remember when it was made and written you will love it too. It is not a son of top gun and everything else that people are saying. It is a young aviator whos friend was KIA and then he gets a chance to go take the guy that did it out. Being as this movie was made in 1990 it has some annoying parts, some of the music, but that is made up for by the fact they didn't reuse all of the flight scenes like they did in top gun. It shows the same scene five times in that movie... In this movie it doesn't it changes everytime, even when practicing the same "i'll give him vertical with a twist move" Hope this sets some of those other guys straight and it is helpful for you guy
