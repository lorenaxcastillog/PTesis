 This is one of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile. It is a love story, but not your typical love story. The love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers. The biggest selling point of the cast is Ms. Rachel McAdams. I saw her in WEDDING CRASHERS and I've been anxious to see more of her work. She is gorgeous AND she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie. I predict her as one of Hollywood's up & coming stars (at least I hope so!). For a guy whose father suffers from Alzheimers, this movie really hit home. An interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young (their courtship) and the period of their Golden Years. This is a must-see movie, even for people who don't normally care for "mushy" movies. In a single word, this story is unforgettable.
