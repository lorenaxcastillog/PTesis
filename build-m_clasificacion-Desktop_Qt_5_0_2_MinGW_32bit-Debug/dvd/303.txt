 Salsa is a brilliant movie - one of the best movies with no major plot. There is fantastic music and great dancing and a hot guy - what more could you want. Rico (Robby Rosa and Menudo) wants to win a dance competition that will take him to Puerto Rico. He's also the older and over protective brother to Rita and when she starts dating his best friend Ken, he goes nuts when he finds out (they keep their relationship secret for a while). Will this ruin his chance of winning the dance comp? As I said earlier, there is fantastic music in this movie. Margarita and Under My Skin are the best. The actual scene when they play Margarita is fantastic. It's a now dated movie, but it is still a favourite of mine that I do watch over and over again still. I love it and any fan of dance movies should love it to - especially if you like that latin flavour
