 Great Plot! A crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs; a good hearted man named Dave who thinks about others, and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance. Dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while. Two of the presidents regular staff try to get Dave to do things that is contrary to Dave's character. So the story goes on from there. Who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the White House. This dvd picture was good and clear, the sound was great, and the case was in excellent condition. If you like warm hearted type movies, then this is the one for you. I know I have enjoyed it over and over. To me, Dave is about character, good or bad, and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us.
