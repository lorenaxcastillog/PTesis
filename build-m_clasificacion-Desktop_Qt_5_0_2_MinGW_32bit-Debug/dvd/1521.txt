 This set of videos does an excellent job of covering the field of astronomy in a comprehensive fashion. It covers both professional and amateur astronomy. It has segments featuring John Dobson, who teaches amateur astronomers how to build their own telescopes and travels to public events to familiarize people with astronomy. There are also segments on the many different areas of professional astronomy, including astronomers studying the stars and planets as well as those studying astrophysics and cosmology. There are interviews with the astronomers where they talk about their work, how they got involved in the field, and segments on how they work to bring an interest in the field to young people. The focus of the series is on astronomers themselves, but there are also many current subjects in the science of astronmy discussed, such as the structure of large groups of galaxies, the cores of galaxies, gravity, and so on. I highly recommend this series for anyone with an interest in astronomy or those who are astronomers. If you or someone you know has an interest in becoming an astronomer, either as an amateur or a professional, this series is indispensible
