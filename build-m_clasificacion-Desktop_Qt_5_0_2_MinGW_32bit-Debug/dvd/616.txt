 For those of you who are not sure where you stand on the big-retailer issue, this piece of pure elitist "culture of fear" rabidly pro-collectivist propaganda is junk. This DVD is Wal-mart haters sewing together the most bald-faced microscopic disinformation in order inspire people to despise a corporation that has the power to restrict union organizing in their business. That's the whole enchilada for these spoil-sports. If you have any concern about issues relating to power, economic and social consequences, and the direction retail marketing is going, DO NOT expect to get much out of this but some Hitlerian diatribe about the Evil Empire of Wal-Mart. Try reading some good articles or watching other documentaries, but if you're just too lazy to think for yourself and want to be sucked into this caricature of corporate hatred, by all means go over to the darkside, Luke. I wish I could give this zero stars.
