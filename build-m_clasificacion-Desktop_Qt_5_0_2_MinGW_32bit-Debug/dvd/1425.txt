 1st, let me say that I LOVE (LOVE!!!!) the JLU seasons...and, I was VERY excited when I found out that these episodes were coming to DVD. To my great disappointment, I found that Disc 3 (the one with Aquaman on the cover of the disc) would not play in ANY of my DVD players, including my computer DVD player. I returned the item to Amazon, and Amazon replaced it in a flash. Again, Disc 3 would not play in my computer DVD player, and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the DVD into my standard DVD player to even start the disc. I returned (sadly) the item again to Amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this DVD edition. So, sadly my wait continues....buyer beware. I can understand a problem with one disc from one order...but to experience the SAME problem with the SAME disc from two different orders...that to me spells defective disc for all. Anyone else out there have a problem with Disc 3 not playing???
