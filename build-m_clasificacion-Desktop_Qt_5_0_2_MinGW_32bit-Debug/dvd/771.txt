 I ordered this video with a lot of interest and found it thoroughly enjoyable. Abba Eban is a very well spoken individual and I found his descriptions very interesting. It certainly captures the historical perspective very well. I did feel, however, that having read a great deal on the conflict that the video was very lacking in many details. I would loved to have seen more on the Entebbe rescue in 1976 as well as more on the Ethiopian Jews that were rescued. The archival footage was captivating - but it left me thirsting for much more. Its definately very difficult to capture so much history in so short a time but I for one, would loved to have seen more world reaction to the events in the Middle East, for instance to have focused a little more on the impotent United Nations and the way they are used as a Arab PR company. However overall I definately reccomend it as a good basis to understand what is happening there but I definately encourage all who view this to do a lot more reading to have a better grasp of the situation in Israel
