 Streep's performance here is awe-inspiring. Even Kevin Kline said so. He said that sometimes he forgot his lines, he was so transfixed by Streep's. No one else even comes close, especially not Katherine Hepburn (even less Audrey Hepburn). Only some of Streep's other roles rival this one. Beyond that, this film should have won not only cinematography that year, as it says above, but best picture. Gandhi was good, this is better. Kline holds his own with what is still his best performance, and even MacNichol is not completely swamped. I think he is miscast, but at a second viewing (and forgetting the book) he begins to grow on you. Speaking of the book, this is one film that is better than the book--for an other example, see Blade Runner. Styron's book has some nice passages, and is full of good ideas, but artistically it is a mess. It cries out for a super-edit, and this film does that pretty well.
