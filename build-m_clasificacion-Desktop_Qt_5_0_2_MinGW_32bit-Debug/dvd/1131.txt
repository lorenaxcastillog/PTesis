 A very strong volume....No episodes that I didn't like. #17 Lullibies of the Lost Verse 2: Interesting episode that finishes off the vol.4 cliffhanger nicely. Great fight scenes, Great story, Good to see Mugen, Jin, and Fuu come back together. #18 War of the Words: Hillarious-ass samurai tagging episode, Great art work on the tagging, Great side story with Mugen learning to read, a very strong episode in my opinion. Probably the most rewatchable on the disc. #19 Unholy Union: Alright episode, we find out who the Sunflower Samurai really is even though I expected who he was, hardly any fight scenes, boring at times, but still a vital part of the series. #20 Elegy of Entrapment Verse 1: A cliffhanger that that left me wanting more: I can understand Japanese people might like Sara's singing but it is hard to listen to for me, No fight scenes until the very end and that's when it really gets good, some romance between Sara and Mugen, an-important-but-kind-of-boring-until-the-end-episode
