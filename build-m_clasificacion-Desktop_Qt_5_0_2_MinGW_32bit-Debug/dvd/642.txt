 Jim Fall's TRICK is a standout romantic comedy amongst many others with all-too stereotypical characters and storylines. Christian Campbell (Gabriel) and J.P. Pitoc (Mark) work very well together on-screen in this story of finding love in the most unlikely of circumstances. Perhaps the most refreshing part of this film is its avoidance of graphic intimacy to convey its message -- while those scenes aren't bad, Jim Fall manages to create in TRICK a film that lets you laugh and enjoy the company that Gabe and Mark share without being disappointed that more didn't happen. Indeed, Gabe and Mark are interrupted at every turn when they try to spend their first night alone, but begin to realize that this quality time is what many relationships lack. Truly, the only disappointment in this film is that you're left patiently waiting for the second date. Tori Spelling costars in this witty, fun comedy about one evening that neither Gabe nor Mark will soon forget. Relax and enjoy this one
