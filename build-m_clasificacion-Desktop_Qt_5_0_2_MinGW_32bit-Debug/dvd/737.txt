 I was really surprised with how much I really enjoyed this movie. I have been a fan of Marvel comics for many years so I was looking forward to seeing this finally, but I have always heard the mixed reviews. Well, I wasn't disappointed and the Fantastic Four, even though the story was different from the comic, was still very fun to watch. Many jokes were really funny and the characters matched very well to their actors, even thought I think Mr. Fantastic looked like a Jeff Goldblum clone. The story was exciting and kept my attention the entire time. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes were as equally impressive. My only problem with the movie was that the stories weren't the same and I would have prefered if nothing was changed in the story line. By far, this isn't the worst comic book movie to be made, believe me, I have seen some stinkers. Overall, I would really recommend this mvoie to Marvel fans. It isn't terrible, unless you are a hardcore nitpicker who tries to find something wrong with a movi
