 I bought this movie to see the Three Stooges in a feature film. What I got was quite an entertaining movie. The Stooges appear several times in the film. The original leader of the Stooges Ted Healy has a pretty big role as Steve. Joan Crawford is the star and plays quite a fiery character...opposite Clark Gable. The movie also shows the debut of Fred Astaire. Although you see the Three Stooges many times in this film they are not featured by any means...Larry probably gets noticed the most as the piano player during Joan Crawford's dance rehearsals. As an overall movie for 1933 standars this was absolutely excellent. I actually thought Gable, Crawford and even Ted Healy played their roles quite well and convincingly. It was certainly the best role I've ever seen Ted Healy in. I recommend this movie to any early movie buff. If you are a Stooges fan however there are probably not enough Stooges moments to keep your interest. But if you want to see the Stooges, Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in the same movie together...well, then by all means, you need to have this. Overall very entertaining and I highly recommend
