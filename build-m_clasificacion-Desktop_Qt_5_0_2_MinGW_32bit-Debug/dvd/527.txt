 This truly is a horrible movie. 7 seconds, huh, yeah 7 seconds to realize I made a mistake in renting it. The acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the filming is horrible... Everything is horrible! I was hopeful because of Snipes, which is why I rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters. The guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie! Snipes couldn't even do the fight scenes and make them look real. The ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love! Huh, they were a romantic interest? They hinted at it, but never showed this happening. Do not rent or buy this movie. Stay away, or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie
