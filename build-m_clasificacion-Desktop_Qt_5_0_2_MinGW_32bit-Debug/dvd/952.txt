 I enjoyed the many twists of speech in this movie, though I found the movie itself vulgar. I reminded myself a few times that this was part of the point that the movie sought to communicate about the Earl, so was pacified. The value of this film is indeed in the acting performances of Depp and Samantha Morton. I enjoyed the Pirates movies, but wasn't particularly dazzled by the acting. Those films are fun, but not memorable in the best sense of the word, for me at least. This helped me to get a stronger impression of Johnny Depp's great talent. This movie has moments I'd like to forget, but the Speeches! The superb Acting and speaking of the Words! If you take the movie in pieces, and listen to it, it elevates, though the visuals ultimately are dark and gritty in a way I've chosen to call "uncomfortable." If you can't take those moments without it casting a shadow on the whole film, don't see this movie.
