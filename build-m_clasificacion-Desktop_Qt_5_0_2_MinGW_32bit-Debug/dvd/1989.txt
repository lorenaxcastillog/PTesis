 This movie is freakin' WEIRD! Thankfully, I like weird. For the uninitiated, this is a musical about a man-eating plant (voiced by Levi Stubbs of The Four Tops). It must be seen to be believed. Our hero, Seymour, discovers a never-before-seen plant, naming it Audrey II (after his coworker and love interest, Audrey). Turns out, the plant eats humans, as he learns when it drinks his blood. At first, Seymour befriends the plant, who helps him get around Audrey's boy friend, a sadistic dentist (the song about him and pseudo-S&M scene that result are freakin' hilarious!) Eventually, things get out of hand - the plant's uniqueness earns Seymour much fame, even though nobody is aware of the plant's dangers. When the plant eats Seymour's boss, things get out-of-hand, and the final battle between the two is hilarious also - Levi Stubbs offers his amazing pipes, declaring "I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!" - one of my favorite movie quotes. This movie is a real side-splitter, and must be seen
