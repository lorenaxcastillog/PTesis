 Patton is an all time favorite of mine. I have now owned five video incarnations of this movie, from Magnetic Video VHS to CBS/FOX VHS to widescreen laserdisc to the THX DVD 2 disc edition to this latest edition. Here is the bottom line comparing the two DVD editions: This new edition's color is slightly better than the previous THX edition. This edition shows a bit more of the bottom of the frame, but a bit less of the left side. This edition's sound is markedly better than the THX edition. However the THX edition has a MUCH sharper video transfer...the best examples are the details visible in the closeups of Patton's right arm saluting the camera and the medals on his uniform, all at the beginning of the movie. You can count the hairs on his hand and see many more medal details in the THX edition. So Fox has yet to put together the definitive video transfer, which will hopefully be corrected when they finally release this in (whichever) high definition format
