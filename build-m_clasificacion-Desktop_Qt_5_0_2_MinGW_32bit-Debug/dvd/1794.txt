 Practical Magic is a comedic love story that is fun and entertaining no matter how many times you have seen it. Yes, it is different than the book, but Hollywood is Hollywood. The movie would not be as much fun if not for the changes-for example Midnight margaritas is a fun scene that makes you smile and wish you were part of the comradery. The Aunts are more lovable and less old & serious than in the book. It is not nec. to go into all the details of the movie if you have not seen it why spoil it for you and besides odds are you have seen it and are thinking about adding it to your collection- so go for it. The bonus features on the DVD are entertaining and interesting. I would tell anyone who likes fun movies to add this one to their collection and don't forget to plant rosemary by your garden gate. Enjoy it
