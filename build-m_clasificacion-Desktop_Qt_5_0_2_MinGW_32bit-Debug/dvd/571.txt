 Superb casting and dark, realistic character storyline make this one of the best crime dramas ever. Deniro's character really deep inside does not want to live anymore since life as he knew it is basically over (the life of crime that drives him). He is also in love and does not understand that and does not know how to deal with it. He makes a stupid mistake at the end letting his emotions cloud his decision making, but is it really a mistake or a death wish in disguise? Pacino fulfills his wish. Pacino's character is just as driven but in the opposite direction. Two sides of the same coin, same coin, different face. Just as Deniro cannot let go of what is killing him neither can Pacino. It takes Deniro's life and leaves Pacino alive but missing the best of life, thus he is also dead, the walking dead.
