 When this film originally came out, I was too young to see it in the theatres, but I was a big fan of the show, regardless of how many people loathed it. It was a precursor to Dawson's Creek only with singing and better dialogue. But now, many years later, I get to see what the big deal was REALLY all about. The casting director did a tremendous job in assembling this ensemble, from Irene Cara (Coco) to Gene Anthony Ray (Leroy) to Albert Hague (Mr. Shorofski); the acting is (for the most part) seamless. Visually, the film looks great; the sound is adequate, the commentary... well, I haven't listened to all of it just yet, but Parker's a bit dry from the bits I HAVE heard. Best of the extra features is the 'class reunion', featuring four of the leads reminiscing about the movie. My only disappointment? They could have included their complete interviews just to pad out the disc a little bit. Overall, however, no complaints. This is just as good a film as Midnight Express, Angel Heart, or The Committments, and it deserves a place in any self-respecting movie lover's collection
