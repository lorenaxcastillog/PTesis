 This wonderful film must be understood as a reflection of the greatest industrial action of the second half of the twentieth century. Yes the performances are wonderful but you should know about the battle of Orgreaves the frame up of Arthur Scargill--the heroic resistance of the miners to the destruction of their community--some reviewer said Britain is better for it-Oh really? check out Yorkshire and the rise of drug use. This film must be viewed with a sense of the real life background--the great miners strike of 1984. How in the world it could be called a comedy beats me. Peter Postlewaite is superb and his closing address deserves real attention. So now the Brits import their coal from pits worked by childeren for 7 cents an hour. Yea Thatcher was a real boon for Britain. Americans on the whole have no idea what that strike was like(there is mention of Women against Pit Closures do Americans know what that organization is?) I hope this film inspires us in the USA to find out more about it
