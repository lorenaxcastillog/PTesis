 I knew I'd like this - I have Lara's 2 other videos and I like her style. She cues well and has a nice, calm demeanor. Rapid Results is different from her other pilates video. In this there are pilates classics with a twist. In the arms section you'll do saw with weights in both hands. I really felt that all over. The bun/thighs section has floor exercises: frog, bridge and side lying leg lifts with lots of leg variations. The abs section was very effective. Again, leg variations make you really feel it in your lower abs. The total body section was tough and I also felt like the stretch was a workout! If you like variety over endless reps you'll love this workout. It's not the same old pilates moves. Lara doesn't show many modifications; but I don't think this was meant for beginners. It's a fluid workout and I was challenged by each 10 minute section
