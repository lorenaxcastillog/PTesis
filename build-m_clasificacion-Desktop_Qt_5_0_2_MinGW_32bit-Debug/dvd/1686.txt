 Oh, yeah, she's in this too, isn't she? Let's see... The brunette, yeah. Good. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get serious and admit that Virginia Madsen is this film's proper eye candy. Yes, my enduring weakness for brassy blondes makes my opinion biased, but can anyone deny that Madsen dominates the rectangle whenever she's in view? Yes, yes, I know, the performance is cartoonish, camp, comical--I'm pretty sure that's what the role calls for--Barbara Stanwick on steroids--but she slides into the femme fatale with ease, has fun with it, and even gives it some depth, some mystery, a hint of pathos. Have fun counting the number of times she uses a body double for the nude scenes. (Hint: The camera follows her as she runs behind a tree beside the old mill, late at night. Is that really Virginia running out the other side?) Have fun with the her bizarre lines: ("I'm f---ing you to death, George!") Truly a great, ham-it-up performance by a versatile actress who never really got her due. Not to detract from Don Johnson's performance. He's almost perfectly cast here.
