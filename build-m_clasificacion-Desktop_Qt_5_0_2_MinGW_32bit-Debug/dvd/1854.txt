 How anyone could give this film a bad review is beyond me. One reviewer went so far as to write, "the character development was nill." I think someone is living in a tunnel of their own not to realize that THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY. Anyway, I won't waste time bashing a minority of reviewers. This is an excellent film. It demonstrates that, to a large extent, our existence is based purely on circumstance. Most of us have been extremely fortunate with the cards we were dealt. But, in a slightly different circumstance in terms of our environment, upbringing, and experience, coupled with just a few bad choices, who knows where we would be. Many of the people in this film are incredibly intelligent, kind, resourceful and witty. There is so much potential with no means of expression except for survival. The only other thing to say is that right now I appreciate the cards I was dealt and hope I always will
