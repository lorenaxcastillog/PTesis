 I have been watching Bewitched when I am doing the ironing in the afternoons and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I first watched the series when livng in England, they played the re-runs when I was a child. I loved it then and was curious to see if at the age of 28 I would still find it as enjoyable. I am pleased to say I did enjoy it just as much, perhaps more. I had forgotten how much fun the story lines are and how well scripted and acted the whole thing is. The whole 60's housewife thing is hilarious and the 60's sets are a real treat. The other thing that is wonderful is that you can watch it with anyone,this is good clean entertainment. In my opinion the box set is great value. There is literally hours of entertainment in there, perfect for a rainy afternoon. This is easy viewing at it's best
