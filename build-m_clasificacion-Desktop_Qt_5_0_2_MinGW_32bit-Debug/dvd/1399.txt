 "Peggy Sue Got Married" is about a woman, who recently learns of her successful husband's philandering ways. She goes to her high school reunion wearing a 60's outfit and when she sees her estranged husband at the reunion and she's voted "Prom Queen" at her reunion, then she faints only to awake back in the 1960's! Everything is back as it was. This time she has a chance to change her future. Only to realize that maybe trying to change her future isn't such a good thing, after all. It's a poignant and witty film that allows you to fantasize about "What if..." I would have done such and such, then what would have happened? To find out exactly just what happens in this exciting and entertaining film with a wonderful soundtrack, then I highly suggest you rent or buy this 80's classic today! You'll be glad you did because the quotes are witty, too! Highly recommended for anyone and everyone; although, it does slightly touch on death, so it might be recommended for those children under 13.
