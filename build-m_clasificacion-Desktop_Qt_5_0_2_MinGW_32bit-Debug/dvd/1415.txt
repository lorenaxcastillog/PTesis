 I must say that this is without a shout of a doubt the funniest animated film EVER. South Park is the brain child of comedy geniuses Matt Stone & Trey Parker, unlike the series this is 10 times funnier. The subtitle of the film describes it perfectly because it is just a longer episode of South Park but completely uncensored. I think it is fair to not only label this an animated film but to also label it a musical as it does contain some of the catchiest tunes you're ever likely to hear. With every South Park episode this film ends with a moral to the story so you will have to watch the entire movie through to understand the moral. This is nothing short of genius comedy and just a great movie to enjoy but be warned this isnt exactly a kids movie as for every third sentence the F word is used. 10/10 = Genui
