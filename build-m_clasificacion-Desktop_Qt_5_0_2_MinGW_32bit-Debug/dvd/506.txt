 The Brainy Baby Right Brain is the first of the Brainy Baby series I bought. Then I came across Laugh and Learn and decided to give it a try. It starts with different babies wearing silly masks and making funny faces. Then goes on about colors, shapes, matching, guessing game, 'yes' or 'no', alphabets and numbers. The DVD is long - so it is advisible to watch it with the baby (if you can) and try to repeat what was said (usually 'yes', 'no', names of colors, etc.). It is too long in one sitting, but I admit I usually just let it play. Baby will do something else after a long while, but periodically go back to the front of the TV and see what the chuckles are all about. I recommend Brainy Baby series. I have bought a few others well in advance of my baby's learning, but I am sure it will be handy when he gets older. The bonus material includes a story telling board, Baby Bloopers, and music video. Quite a lot of material packed into one DVD. This is suitable only for older babies (10 months +++).
