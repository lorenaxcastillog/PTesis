 Purchased season one, volume 1, a few months back and enjoyed them very much. Looking forward to season two soon to arrive. The shows are as good as remembered and from a person who doesn't watch network shows today, only sports and news on CNN or FOX, these Perry Mason DVDs are just like manna from heaven. I don't care that Perry Mason was the only attorney who never lost a case, for in every epiode he matches wits with both Tragg and Burger. I even like ole 'hamburger' better now that I've aged. And the one episode where Mason says he'll buy Burger's meal, as long as it's 'crow' is priceless. I had forgotten the many instances where Perry is close to being either disbared or brought up on charges, but they are all included in this first 19 episode series. And the cars: either the 57 Ford convertible or the large, classic Cadillac that Perry drives, and the small sports car that Paul gets Perry into every once in awhile. Great memories, great viewing. Recommended. Semper Fi
