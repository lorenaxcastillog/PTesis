 this film is a great watch! something in this would apply to everyone. the movie is full of subtleties that you almost have to watch it carefully several times, to pick up on all the great moments and appreciate them. the girl in the film who is one of the main characters does a great job of showing the suffering and efforts of refugees, women in a society dominated by men, and children living in poor conditions. she doesnt speak once throughout the entire film, yet her story is clear, and you feel she has told you her entire life history. the movie highlights the forgotton, or ignored plight of afghans living as refugees. this particular film shows the situation as it took place in iran, where many afghans fled following the soviet invasion. i recommend this to all. the film is in farsi with subtitles, but this doesnt make it a film that only applies to a foreign audience who understands the original dialect, this will touch you
