 This strange but charming movie combines the unique talents of director Tim Burton, star Johnny Depp and co-star Martin Landau to tell the story of Ed Wood, the 50's B-movie director of such now cult classics as "Glen or Glenda" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space", both considered to be among the worst movies of all time. Depp stars as Wood, an eternal optimist with a penchant for cross-dressing. Landau does an amazing turn as Bela Lugosi, whom Wood "rescued" off the scrap heap to star in his low-budget productions, all the time being a true friend in every sense of the word. Burton contributes his singular surrealistic style--the world of the movie seems to be set in one of Wood's productions. Not many people saw this movie on its first release, but like Wood's pictures, it's become a cult classic, but because it's so good, not because it's so bad it's good
