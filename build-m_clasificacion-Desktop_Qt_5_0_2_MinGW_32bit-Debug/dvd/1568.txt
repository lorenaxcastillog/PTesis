 After playing Doom 3 (the PC video game), I had high hopes for this movie. Oh well. The movie was disappointing. Were their monsters? Yup. Blood and guts? Yup. Swearing? Yup. Guns and special effects? Yup. But after playing the PC video game, the movie lacked a lot on storyline. And it didn't make me jump as much as the game. The movie is dark, but that's okay, since it was patterned after the video game, which is also dark (although the game was much more "playable"...with darkness...than the movie was "watchable"). The game was scarier too. This says a lot about the game creators (very well done), and the movie directors (poor effort). I'm not sure why Hollywood couldn't hack it. It might be okay as a rental (especially if you haven't played the game), but don't buy it. Honestly, the movie turned-out to be just another alien movie. However, the game tells a very different story..
