 I Recently watch this film and I was glad I did. Being a fan of Ray Liotta, this film, &quot;Dominick &amp; Eugene&quot; brings out the good side of brotherly love (just kidding). The story is about two brothers, Dominick and Eugene; Dominick (Tom Hulce), also called &quot;Nicky&quot;, is a mildly retarded garbageman who makes a good living out of it: in fact, he is the one one puts food on their table. His twin brother, Eugene (Ray Liotta), is a stubborn man, who wants to go to Med. school to become a doctor, so he can support Dominick and Himself. Dominick manages to be more sucessful in business than his brother by his personality; he likes going to wrestlemania, Loves &quot;The Hulk&quot; and his best friends are a sleazy, but friendly, garbageman and a young boy who is being beaten by his father, in which Dominick was too when he was young. Eugene's girlfriend (played by Jamie Leigh Curtis) makes attraction with both men, but doesn't really seem to be a big problem. More heartwarming plot happens, with a ending that will make you cry your heart out. Very good stuff
