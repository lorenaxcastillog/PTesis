 Anyone who gave this movie a 1 star rating needs to go find a really high cliff to go jump off of. This is actually a pretty decent film, with some beautiful shots and cool desert scenery, and ok acting from Van Damme. Most of the supporting cast play their parts quite well too I believe (and seemingly good chemistry between the main characters). I mean yeah of course this isn't Lawrence of Arabia or Saving private ryan, but then again what else is? I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie, it has some kind of pleasant addicting nature to it that I can't quite describe. A great film to watch if you are sick at home or just plain out of your mind bored. And also, I'll definitely have to give this movie props as being the best movie I've ever found in the Walmart 5 dollar bin. Even better than the lower budget clint eastwood flicks that I've found in there. It's THAT good!
