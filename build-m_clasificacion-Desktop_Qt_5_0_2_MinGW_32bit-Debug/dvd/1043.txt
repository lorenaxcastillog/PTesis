 Jack Nicholson is equal to himself in this film but the subject and the plot does not give him a lot of possibilities to reveal his talent. This meeting of a marginal man in society with an opera singer could have really proposed the exploration of two rich worlds that have little in common. The meeting argument being security and watchdogs it is casual and the subsequent love affair is purely accidental. Yet it is fiery and disturbed by an ex-husband and a very frustrated wife. But the film avoids any kind of depth. It remains superficial and purely anecdotal. It is a sort of fairy tale in the modern world. No discovery of the opera milieu and no discovery of the world of quasi-failing men. And what's more, the opera world is reduced to a Mass by Johan Sebastian Bach, which is not exactly an opera. It is sometimes funny, but only funny ah ah, though it could have been funny strange. A let down in other words for such an actor who must have had some pressing bills to pay at the time of the shooting. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
