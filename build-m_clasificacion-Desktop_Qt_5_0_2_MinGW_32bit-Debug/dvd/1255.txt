 My only regret is that I let this video sit for six months after buying it in the throes of misery: hot flashes, night sweats, etc. After finding a progesterone cream and some other supplements that helped, I forgot the video. Come wintertime and weather precluding daily walks, I finally got the video out with an apprehensive groan. Couldn't have been more wrong. Kathy makes movement fun and even inspirational. The workouts help me in ways that walking, much as I love it, cannot. So far I just do the cardio & yoga portions. The cardio makes me feel strong and energized. The yoga is so welcome - I love the stretching & the help with relaxation. Kathy's humble, folksy approach suggests she may have studied with someone like the wonderful Lilias. The only problem I have is the need to fast forward from the cardio to the yoga segments. Kathy talks about different menopausal issues and tips in between. It would have been better if the workout segments were together. Maybe next time
