 Let me just start off by saying the Dave Matthews Band is my number one all time favorite band of all time and always will be for the rest of my life. This concert was the best dmb cconcert i have ever seen other than the concert i went to at darien lake in 2005 that was and still is and awlays will be my number one favorite concert that i seen or been to of all time and always will be for the rest of my life!!!!!!! But anyways this concert first of all has an amazing setlist. The songs thyat really stand out are All Along the Watchtower, Warehouse, and What you Are, and of course the classics like two step, ants marching ect. also the jams are amazing. The sound quality is amaazing and the camera really spends time showing each of the band members. The bonus feature isnt bad either. Just a great concert.. Cant wait for Dave Matthews Bands next cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
