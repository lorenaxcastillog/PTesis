 I liked this film alot and agree with most of the positive comments (and some negative..the swings remind me of Shock aka Beyond the Door II). My comment/question is a bit of a spoiler for those who haven't seen it. It seems to me the 'infection' is a metaphor for medical malpractice and it begins with apathy and lack of caring for the patients. As for the ending, upon re-watching it, I notice the head nurse who returns gets 'infected' when she doesn't want to sign for a patient. (The clipboard scene). The other medic (emt?) insists so she finally signs it. That seems to doom her. That's what I got from the film, I dig J-Horror but much of it is cultural and that's what makes it so interesting. I was lucky to see Ju On with two Asian women who explained tons of stuff I never would've understood so I'm sure there's lots I didn't 'get' in Infection.
