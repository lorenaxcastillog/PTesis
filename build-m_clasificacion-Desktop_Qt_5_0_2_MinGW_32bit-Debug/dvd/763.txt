 I've walked through my local Blockbuster new release section many times over the last few months, looked at the video box, picked it up, but then the title "Wicker Park" and the cheesey artwork would make me put it back on the shelf. Now I find myself writing my first review in two years. Fortunately for me, this movie was on Showtime last Friday night and I finally got to see it. I don't want to describe it with all the details and plots, you can look at other reviews for that, I want to relay the way the movie made me feel. It's a film I knew nothing about and had not seen the trailer, after watching it I was reminded of how I felt after seeing "Donnie Darko" for the first time without knowing anything about it. In short, imagine the film "Closer" meets "Memento". I'm surprised this film hasn't received the cult status of Darko or Memento, it's probably for the same reason I never rented it, poor marketing. My suggestion for a better title is "Love Again".
