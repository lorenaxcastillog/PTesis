 The 24th day, directed by Tony PIccirillo, explores the lives of two men, Tom (Scott Speedman) and Dan (James Mardsen) and how their one night encounter changes all their lives. This script is so well written the dialogue alone keeps you tense and wanting more. Speedman plays a man one the edge, driven by anger, hate, desperation and James Mardsen gives a terrific performance as a sexy, charismic man that is charming and boyish. These qualities from both actors mix so well that the sparring between the two brings about some tremendously moral debating. Responsibility, truth, honor, do they exist? The choices we make are our own, yet how does one live with the consequences. How well do we know our partners, husbands, wives, how safe is monogamy? Piccirillo brings a raw, fierce and honest look at the actions that impact not only our lives but others. This movie is powerful and one you will want to own
