 Though short of classic status, "Prime Cut" has alot to recommend it. Director Michael Ritchie has a sharp eye for Middle-America ambience and stages some good action set pieces. Lee Marvin is in classic tough guy form as Devlin, the bagman sent by the Chicago bosses to collect a debt from sleazy Mary Ann(Gene Hackman), whose Kansas City meat plant is a front for a more lucrative trade in white slavery and narcotics. Hackman, in what is in essence an extended cameo, makes a colorful impression here. Sissy Spacek, as a girl entrapped in Hackman's operation, isn't really given much to do in her film debut but is easy on the eyes in a fresh-faced kind of way. The film breezes by at an economical 86 minutes. Interesting casting here with Gregory Walcott("Plan 9 from Outer Space" infamy) as Hackman's brother and Eddie Egan(the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle of "The French Connection" fame) as a Chicago mob boss
