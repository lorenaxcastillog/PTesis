 I love this movie and it has gained somewhat of a cult standing amongst several of my friends since we first saw it two years ago. The story is definitely interesting (random people awake to find themselves trapped in an endless series of cubes, some of which are equipped with lethal traps) and is primarily what holds up the movie because the script and the acting are only mediocre. Because they are such weak elements, the script and the acting become comical if you try not to take them too seriously. I think that this is the best way to watch this film, otherwise you may come away from it thinking that it was purely awful. For instance some of the dialouge includes lines like "have you all been sniffing glue all your lives?" and "I can see inside people like a f*ckin' x ray!." Funny, right? Not the kind of dialouge you can take seriously and believe in. However, the story is very cool and the movie does offer some frightening moments, but overall I would recommend this film as a comedy. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of humo
