 My husband and I watched this movie for the first time last night. He always picks on me about bringing home "weird movies", though he actually seemed to enjoy this one along with me. We both agreed we liked the nuclear missile home the best, but would love to know and visit the Alligator guy as a friend. I am fascinated with those that are just a bit "off". Not weird, not crazy... just those that live their life just doing their own thing no matter what anyone "normal" would think. These people are doing just that and happily ; proudly showing off their creations of "home". I agree that this film was much too short to let us really get to know these homeowners, and there didn't really seem to be any obvious direction as to what unheard questions these people were answering. Overall, I still enjoyed this movie very much. It makes me happy to see there are people who live their lives simply and happily in their own way. =c)
