 Yes, "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" is still a funny film. This first film by Tim Burton still hold's a magical charm for me. I remember when it was being filmed in Santa Monica, Californina. [Parts of it anyway] One of the most hilarious scenes of course is his excursion through the Alamo. 'Where's the basement?" But one of the things I found funny about the film was his neurotic behavior over his stolen bicycle. And the extremes he goes through in order to get it back. Now, the film is a bit dated, but not in a negative way. It is still able to hold on to the charm of a funny comedy even after so many years. My goodness, 21-years-ago! I am beginning to feel my age. I can't believe it's been so long. I highly recommend the film to all viewers, it is still a charming and delightful watch. And Pee-Wee is still funny after all these years. Recommended.[Stars: 4.5]
