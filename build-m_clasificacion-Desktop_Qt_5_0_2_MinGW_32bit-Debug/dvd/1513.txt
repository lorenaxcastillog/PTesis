 And now, in their holy and ongoing quest for expansion of form, the noble knights of the realM bring the sable brush of surrealism to the proceedings both musically and visually. Twisted humor, sly buffoonery, and elastic reality are combined with groaning mountains of overcooked spaghetti and a stripper dancing while the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band sings "Death Cab For Cutie"...and what Mystery Tour is complete without midget wrestling? This show is completely misunderstood and underrated: the Beatles could swing the avant-garde with the best of them. This is one of the most perfect expressions of mid-sixties hallucinatory lunacy made, and it is, as such, a logical tangent from the mania and silliness of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!". Remember, when the going gets strange, the strange only get stranger, and when the weirdness starts to crackle in from the edges, that's when it's time to turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy the show
