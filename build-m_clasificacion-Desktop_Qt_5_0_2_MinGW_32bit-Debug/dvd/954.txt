 I waited to post my review of The Libertine until I could get through the director's commentary. However, the commentary really didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. The Libertine is the story of the Earl of Rochester played by (Johnny Depp). It's a 17th-century period piece. I believe this is a movie about relationships. The Earl of Rochester's relationship with King Charles, his relationship with his wife, Elizabeth Malet played by Rosamund Pike (Pride & Prejudice). His prostitute Jane played by Kelly Riley (Mrs. Henderson presents . . . ), and the actress Elizabeth Berry played by Samantha Morton. His relationship with the actress is significant because he lives out his life of debauchery in the theater. John Wilmot's one redeeming quality, if we can say that he had any redeeming qualities, is that he helps the actress with her craft. This movie is not for everyone, if nudity or sexual situations in movies easily offend you then this movie is not for you. This movie doesn't have any likable characters. However, if you enjoy history, appreciate fine acting, and the subject matter doesn't offend you. Then this movie may be for you
