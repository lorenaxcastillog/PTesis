 Jack Nicholson's Joker is a performance for the ages - and one to which perhaps more of us should take heed. Egoistic misanthropy and callous disregard for life have exponentially exploded among our species since the great actor's wild parody of the sins of the "Me Generation". To me, the speeches of our nation's political and corporate leaders at times hauntingly echo Nicholson's Joker's now classic harangues - and private corporate armies? Is there really much difference between Blackwater and the "Joker's men"? In my opinion, this performance is Nicolson's greatest - although there have been many other superb ones - and that is said solely on the basis of the moral statement. Nuff said. Awesome script. The technics of the film have been justly celebrated and imitated. The soundtrack is my favorite extended effort of Prince. And it's great to have it in such a technically superior package. Stands the test of time. To be seen in conjunction with reading the amazing "Rise and Fall of the Guber Brothers" -if you can find a copy
