 Just imagine what the Trevor Howard / Celia Johnson would [could?] have been like IF they had this freedom??? Also imagine the make-up artist ['hair' dresser?]; and the, err .... focus puller on this one's set ...... No, no, no! Although rather brave - who the heck cares? It's all very natural and somewhat vaguely contemporary, but really - WHY bother? As our beloved Peter Finch [I think] said in "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" - here come those boring old T..s again!" As for safe sex? [The lady during a half-pant or two - breathlessly demands 'protection' from the, err..'intruder' .... UNREALISTIC, regarding the intensity of their meeting{s}, and their obsession with each other's body parts]. Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey were by far more interesting in their plastic raincoats on a windswept beach [ditto Kerr and Lancaster]. Brando/Schneider also Bogard/Rampling were FAR more tortured in their versions along the same theme. then ... we WILL always have "Intermezzo"/"In the Realm of the Senses".
