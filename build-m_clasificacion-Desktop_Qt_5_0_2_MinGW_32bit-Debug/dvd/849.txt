 "Death comes too quickly, enjoy life while you may" is the theme of this picture by Kurosawa. An old man, 25 years a do-nothing, paper-pushing bureaucrat, discovers he's dying of cancer. Suddenly he realizes he's lived an empty life and wants to finally do something for himself. He flounders at first looking for a way and then decides to help get a park built by tenaciously fighting through all the red tape necessary to get the job completed. Most of the movie is concerned with the old man's "false search" for happiness - getting drunk, trying to befriend his young secretary. But then he hits upon his scheme for doing something worthwhile. And here, I think, Kurosawa blunders: he jumps the clock ahead five months to the man's death and tells the old man's story regarding the park in flashbacks as fellow workers and local politicians reminisce at his funeral. It breaks the flow of the movie badly and also changes its focus - we now get an attack on the bureaucracy. For the most part, however, the movie is very moving and the final word almost on the despair of a life not lived. Definitely worth a watch
