 I have no doubt in my mind that this series will go down as the most realistic western ever done.I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but i am afraid Clint would not be able to top this one.I have heard people belly aching about the bad language used, even here in New Zealand but hey that's why they called it the wild west.The sets look great,the town looks like a real hell hole and Ian McShane who plays Al Swearengen is like the J R Ewing of the old west only meaner.I have always been a big Powers Booth fan and i am glad him and Brad Douriff are also in this epic series.I am about to watch season 2 and can't wait until season 3 comes out,i never watch them on T V here as they have about a million ads on and I have always thought that this spoils a show,keep up the good work Deadwood cast and crew
