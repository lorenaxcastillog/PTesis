 Okay...so Final Stab is definitely a cliche' film, there is no denying that. But why should it be hounded for being cliche' when nearly all slasher films on the market today are cliched as well? This movie was really a diamond in the rutt. I went in expecting pure garbage, but what I got was a decent horror film that actually made me jump, and did manage to create suspense. The only fault I find with this movie is the ending. The slow-motion scenes are WAY too drawn out, and even after the movie was over, I still wasn't sure who the killer was. I mean, the killer's story made sense until the last minute or so of the film, at which point, the whole thing kind of fell apart. This movie is definitely work renting and maybe worth buying if you're in the mood for old-fashioned, slasher cliche' fun
