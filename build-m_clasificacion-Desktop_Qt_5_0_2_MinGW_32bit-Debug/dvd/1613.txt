 Mel gibson is a taxi driver at night, who is your basic, average, paranoid, new yorker, worker, secret newspaper writer. He writes his own newspaper called "CONSPIRACY THEORY." It's basically a collection of whatever he deems suspicious from what he can read in the newspapers. This guy's whole life revolves around keeping his routine like clockwork, changing how he gets to his apartment to how he exits it. Very paranoid. Everyone thinks he's a nut . . .until one of his suspicions hits right on the nose. Even he gets surprised when he gets captured by the people who read the article. "I was right, wasn't I? Wait a minute! What was I right about?" There is also an underlining love story between julia roberts and mel gibson and a government secret that connects them. You'll love this thriller. I know I loved it. Why, you ask? Becuase, for once in a movie, the Paranoid guy was right . . .and is the hero . . .just like in hitchcock movies. Come to think of it, it does have a tiny spirit of NORTH BY NORTHWEST in it. Enjoy
