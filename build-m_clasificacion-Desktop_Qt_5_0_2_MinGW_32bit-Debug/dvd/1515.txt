 I fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with Jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal. However, then the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began, and the antiquated ideas about "provocation of rape" were ceaselessly unpealed. Leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed, how she acted, if she flirted. Reflections of a bygone era when a crime wasn't a crime, but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line. But even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter, often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end. No smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble. Just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor's awareness of the victims paternal history. Nonsense, and 3 hours down the tubes. However, the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge, and the appearance of a young George C. Scott, who at that age was interestingly a deadringer for Michael Douglass. Jimmy does a stand-up job as always
