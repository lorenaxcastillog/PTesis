 Although I have 99% of U2's music, I was never really exposed to their videos. This DVD gave me a great chance to "catch up"! My absolute favorites are "Electrical Storm" and "Discoteque" since they give us a chance to see another side of the band members personalities, especially Larry's! Kudos to him for having the courage to stand out a little bit more! I, too, was frustrated at the missing disc and blame Amazon for not explaining it in their buyer info (unless I of course missed it.) They could have used the opportunity to explain how to get the second disc and made an "upsell" with me. Oh well. The DVD was also a little cumbersome in its navigation, but once you figure out the quirks you've got it. I LOVED the commentaries and the small documentaries and the bonus tracks. I'm glad I made this purchase and am looking for more video material
