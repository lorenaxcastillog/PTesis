 I saw "Stardust" on cable tv and enjoyed the fact they did under line her work for the Hollywood Canteen, and Davis was the FIRST female to be honored with AFT Life Achievement Award. *I DON'T feel ex-servants who were fooling around with Bette Davis' husband is a reliable source for an interview. *ALSO, how do we know what Jack Warner said to Bette Davis regarding "Gone With The Wind" -- it is very likely he did dangled the promise of the role of Scarlette, even if he did not have the rights to the movie. ONLY the two parties involved know -- Davis and Warner. *Also, her ex-husband "supposedly" told the women he cheated on with about events about another husband. *sigh* *Celeste Holmes is hardly reliable, she stood in front of an audience at the AFI awards praising DAVIS, AFTER DAVIS' death Holmes bad mouthed her. *cough* Of course -- The Films Jezebel The Man Who Came to Dinner Old Acquaintance are most enjoyable! Davis is the only female actor from the "Golden Age" who carried a film on her OWN -- she did not have the strong leading man to rely upon as other famous legends.
