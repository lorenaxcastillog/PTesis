 I bought this at Collage Video some time ago. I have all of Christies workouts. The reason I have them all? She is AMAZING. She is totally profesional and a joy to watch. She has great personality, and she knows her stuff. She is so quick on the step, I don't know how she calls out all the moves. She'll cues exceptionally well - she'll sing out the cues to the tune of the great music her dvds have. This one has We Will Rock You, Heard It Through The Grapevine and I Love Rock and Roll to name a few. She's quick and on the ball. The choreography is sometimes complex, but once you've done it a couple of times, you'll get the hang of it and wonder how on earth you are doing it. If you are still stuck, there are some exercisers in the back row, who do easier versions that makes following easier. There is also a bonus ab workout. Christie really is the very best instructor and fun to watch
