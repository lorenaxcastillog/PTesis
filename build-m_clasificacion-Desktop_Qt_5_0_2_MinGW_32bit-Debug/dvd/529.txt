 I was extremely disappointed with this title in the sense that it is a one way only answer. They do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything Mr. Brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions. They also seem to point to Mr. Brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book. I am an open-minded person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities. This dvd made me feel like a fool to do so. On the other hand, if you don't beleive anything in the book, then this dvd is for you. It might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation, the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth, you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home... the bible. How convenient! Hope this helps
