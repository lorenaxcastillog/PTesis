 Proponents and opponents of the verdict that sentenced the Rosenberg's to death agree that the harsh sentencing was a product of the extremely tumultuous and fearful times in which they lived. Anne Meeropol, a grandchild of the Rosenberg's, put together a well-crafted documentary that explains her family's life in the shadow of her grandparent's misfortunes. Heir to An Execution is not a fair and balanced synopsis of the Rosenberg Trials. Nor will it ever become the equivalent of a history book on this subject. Through slickly crafted interviews, Meeropol explains the Rosenberg Trials from her family's unique position. Although the movie drags on at the end, very little of the footage is the traditional stock video shown in tired documentaries. After viewing Heir to An Execution, I was more confused than before on the Rosenberg Trials. This is not the fault of Meeropol; her perspective provides a fresh outlook on a somewhat tired debate. Rather, the movie is more effective on showing the ease with which members of the same family are willing to disown each other in the face of crisis
