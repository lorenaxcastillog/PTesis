 Wow..the last season of "Good Times." Watching this last season, took me back to days of hanging out with the family eating chips and sipping on red Kool-Aid in Mississippi (Daddy James' homestate). I like all seasons, but this one was clearly the best. Why? It provided the viewing audience with the idea that black folks can live the American Dream, no matter how deferred. Unfortunately, it is this cultural mythmaking that gives the idea that black folks must leave their " 'hoods" to be successful. Also, unfortunately, this final season did not let the theme of "ghetto-blacks" die as evidence in contemporary comedies and movies. All this to say, the acting and writing in this final season are top-quality. The actors and scenes will take you back and, for those who were not there to view it before reruns, it will make you feel like you should have been born earlier. Most of all, pay attention to the theme song...it is still applicable today. So, the themes of "Good Times" are still relevant. Thus, the show is a must-see. The season is a must-buy.
