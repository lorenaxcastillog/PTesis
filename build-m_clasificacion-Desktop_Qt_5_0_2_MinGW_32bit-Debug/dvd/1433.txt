 Critters -or "crites" -are intergalactic criminals who escape from their gaolers and land in Kansas.They are pursued by the forces of the law , leather clad bounty hunters with shape shifting abilities .The crites are not notably pleasant creatures -while they resemble tumbleweeds(albeit omnivotous tumblweeds ) they have the nasty habit of discharging poison darts from their skin and have murderous dispositions .They lay siege to a farm house in Grover's Bend ,Kansas and are intent on the destruction of any humans with whom they come into contact The movie has a nice line in wry ,acerbic humour and the performance from a capable cast ,which includes Dee Wallace Stone , M Emmett Walsh and Scott Grimes are excellent . Add some good production values and the result is a sharp little movie that is funny without deetracting from its merits as a neat little monster movie Entertaining and witty
