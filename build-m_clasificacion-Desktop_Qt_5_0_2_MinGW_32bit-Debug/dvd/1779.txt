 This movie is one you can't just take off the shelf expecting it to be a brainless horror. This is the movie at the top of my list that is both creepy and contemplative. It's the thrilling gift of a child that really catches your attention. Other poeple can't see lost souls that don't know they're dead, but the boy can, and in this movie he tries to learn how to deal with his gift and lend a hand to the lost dead people. To help him with this problem, Dr. Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) comes to talk to the child (who's played by Haley Osment). There's a secret throughout the movie about the Dr. of which he and the people watching don't know that shows a whole different view on things. The secret is revealed towards the end and gives a shocking turn to the movie. Scary and yet very satisfying, the movie is highly recommended!!
