 Look, this was a good movie but the reason it doesn't make sense is due to poor/lazy screenwriting. Those of you watching and rewatching this film trying to make sense of it are creating the plot yourselves. Therefore your creativity has to make up for the writer's lack thereof. Artists use this trick very often as well as other gurus and showmen, "if you don't understand it it's because you're not smart enough" for example. I'm not putting down the movie because it's better than 90% of what's been made in the last 10-20 years. But just don't think that Lynch is some genius that's constructed this intricate puzzle. If he did say the "key" bit it's just another way of egging on the viewer, "go ahead and figure it out if you're smart enough." Many so called prophets/psychics use this technique as well, writing numerous cryptic messages and allowing the person to interpret it himself. A person is 100% more likely to believe something if he comes up with it himself. Anyway that's just the way I see it, I could be wrong.
