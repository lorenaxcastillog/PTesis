 Novelist Anthony Burgess is obviously a wordsmith of the highest order, and director Stanley Kubrick was able to share that in the dialogue and especially the narrative. The film is itself is one of the most clever and perceptive I've seen, with a sardonic wit, and a sense of irony so sharp it almost hurts. Shockingly violent visuals. Psychedelica gone amok which you must love. This 1971 vision of the world in and my 2005 vision of the world are identical. If you've never seen it, go get it right now. It's very hard to believe this film is 34 years old. It's too damn modern. I'd really hate to be Kubrick 30 years after this film, probably knowing he'll never top it. Malcolm McDowell. I suppose that, for many folks, he'll go down in cinematic history as the guy who killed Captain Kirk. I'd like to humbly suggest that McDowell watch this film so he can remember that, once upon a time, he was a damn fine actor.
