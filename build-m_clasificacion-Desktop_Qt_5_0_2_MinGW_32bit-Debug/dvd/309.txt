 I guess I didn't have the grandiose expectations that some CT fans did, because I think the FTTY dvd is super! Of course, this might have something to do with the recent purchase of my first dvd player (yes, very slow here to update to new...now old, technology)and purchasing my first ever CT dvd. I can understand those who may find this dvd lacking in comparison to previous releases. I've seen a couple of CT performances and listened to several of their cds... I love their songs, but I thoroughly enjoy listening to them talk about their life experiences etc. Sometimes forthright, often ambigous, they never fail to make me smile. Yes, it would have been a big plus for the band to sing more of their songs in entirety, but all in all, this did not diminish the quality for me. I was just wondering where track number 16 is... &quot;California Man&quot; ????
