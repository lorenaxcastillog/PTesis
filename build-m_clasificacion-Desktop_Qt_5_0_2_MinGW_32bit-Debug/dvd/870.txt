 My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of "healthy" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story.
