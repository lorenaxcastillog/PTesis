 The journey continues for Mugen, Jin and Fuu as they reunite after the fight in episode 15. They meet a falsely accused man on the run from the law, a group of avid Graffiti taggers, an underground Christian cult, and a blind, wandering musician as they get closer to their destination. Fuu finally confides the truth of the Sunflower Samurai's identity to Mugen and Jin, as well as discovers a secret of his past and a tentative identity. The best single episode of the entire series is on this disc, "War of the Words," in which Mugen learns how to read from a hard-drinking teacher as tough as he is, a hilarious parody of Andy Warhol shows up, and Mugen is credited with inventing the Infinity symbol as his own tag (?). This series has always had a creative and ingenious sense of anachronism, but it's perfected here. Whether viewed as a samurai comedy or a spectacular action series, this is one of the best anime to come out in years
