 I really enjoy the House of Elliot. The series starts off well with two sisters going into the dress-making business and opening up their own successful shop. Season 2 ditches some of the old villains (the scheming relatives) and introduces a French designer and a banker as the antagonist/s of the season. Again, as with the first series, I like the character Bea a bit more than I like Evie. Evie's antics don't really excite me that much. She seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two. I also don't find myself enraptured by the Jack/Bea romance. While I enjoy both characters individually, I see Bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife. Also, I don't really care that much about the film industry, so watching Jack 'on the job' doesn't hold that much appeal. Still, this was a solid season and its nice to see the sisters be successful for once
