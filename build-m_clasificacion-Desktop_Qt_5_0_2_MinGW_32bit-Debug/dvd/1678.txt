 Tamilee Webb's 2 DVD set is the best! She has you working hard without a steep learning curve. If you have read my other reviews, then you know that I hate videos with complicated steps or poor instructions. Tamilee knows her stuff and she shares that knowlege with you. You learn how to do each move the right way every time. The Weight Loss DVD is my favorite, but you should note it requires a step. The first few times I tried it, my legs felt like jelly afterwards. When I was able to get through the whole workout, there was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. The lower body workout is strenuous without being exhausting. When I've complete the video, I feel energized rather than depleted. Tamilee's cueing is efficient and her timing is excellent. There are only a few minor negative points; the music is a little bland and the two women who are exercising with Tamilee are too perfect to seem real. I really appreciate it when workout videos show normal looking people. That being said, these videos are two of my favorites. I never seem to tire of them.
