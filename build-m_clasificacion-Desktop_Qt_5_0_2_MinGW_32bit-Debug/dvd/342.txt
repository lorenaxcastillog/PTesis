 What makes Julia Roberts' Oscar winning performance as Erin Brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners Charlize Theron (Monster); Nicole Kidman (The Hours); and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Roberts didn't hide behind makeup or non-glamor to win her trophy. She utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy, but somewhat tawdry, young woman who brings down a corporate giant. Roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before. She is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous Albert Finney as her lawyer boss and friend; Aaron Eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship; Marg Helgenberger as the cancer-stricken client that starts the ball rolling; and Conchata Ferrell as the "krispy kreme" office worker who she spars with. Director Stephen Soderbergh (an Oscar winner for TRAFFIC) wisely keeps the focus on Brockovich's determination and her single motherhood dilemma. It's a very entertaining, and thought-provoking, movie, a showcase for one of Hollywood's modern icons
