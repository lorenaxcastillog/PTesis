 This wasn't all that funny Nor did I see romance I saw instead four drama queens Plus one more wearing pants Unlike Carrie and her pals This ain't $ex and the City Three are married, one is not And all deserving pity Three have money, one does not Olivia's a maid She walked out on her teaching job And now is underpaid Franny got hers in a will Jane from designing clothes Christine is a writer while Olivia's debt grows Despite the money that they have None of them are content Insecure and neurotic And certainly high rent But if you really look at them They reflect our inner fears Getting fat, and getting old And thinking no one cares To enjoy this chick flick movie You have to dig down deep Explore your inner feelings And then drift off to sleep Rated: 3.5 stars Amanda Richards, October 29, 2006
