 I have an 18 month old boy and a 3 year old girl. This is the video I put in when I want to rest and cuddle with my son - it is very calming and peaceful, and he seems captivated by it. My daughter had always enjoyed it as well, and now sings along with many of the songs. While I would agree with some reviewers who say that the images aren't directly educational or necessarily related to the music like some other dvds out there, that doesn't bother me. I like that the images aren't as fast paced as some of the Baby Einstein shows, and I especially like the fact that my children are learning some of the praise songs we sing in church. Also, the vocals and instrumentals don't drive me nuts like much of the music that is geared for children - I actually enjoy hearing it in the background and singing along with it
