 If you found this page then you aready know who Joe Bonamassa is. The band's performance is awesome. The camera work is great and keeps you in touch with all 3 members plus the audience. The set list is very enjoyable. But what is up with the sound? This is a CONCERT DVD. We buy these for the sound as much as the visuals, and this one has seriously sub-par sound. As someone else mentioned there is only one sound stream (stereo), despite a link in the menu that promises DTS surround sound. That in itself is no big deal.

Bottom line: It's Joe, so buy the DVD. But like me, you may lament what should have been
