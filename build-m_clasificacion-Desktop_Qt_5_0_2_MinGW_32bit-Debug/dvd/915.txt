 I would rate this 4-5 stars FOR BEGINNERS, but 2 stars for more advanced users. What's commendable about this video is that she really takes time to EXPLAIN HOW TO PROPERLY DO EACH MOVE, and she gives good advice to how to modify the move for people who are not as strong or have bad backs. It really makes a beginner not feel lost in terms of how to coordinate the new motions. However, for anyone who is beyond the absolute beginner level, this tape is VERY BORING FOR MORE ADVANCED USERS because more than half workout time is spent listening to her talk about how to do each move, rather than just doing the moves; even after the 1-hour workout I felt like I only did 15minutes of exercise, so it was a waste of my time. (For intermediate level users I would recommend other videos, such as Ana Caban's video which goes through more moves at a not-rushed paced but without the dead time in between each move.
