 Kurosawa set out to make a pure actioner - no deep meanings, no heavy thinking - and this was the result. Two clownish, greedy men are enlisted by a warlord (Toshiro Mifune) and a princess to transport a pile of gold across the mountains to re-establish the princess's defeated clan. They get into all kinds of scrapes, many of them improbable and comic - a la the old Hollywood western action pictures - and, of course, succeed in their task. Also like many western heroes, the characters are inspired by a code of honor that places duty above all else. George Lucas stole freely from this movie when he was making STAR WARS, including the lengthy fight with lances. Mifune is excellent, as are the two buffoonish, bumbling fools (later reincarnated by Lucas as R2-D2 and C-3PO). A fun movie to watch, especially in the hands of a master like Kurosawa
