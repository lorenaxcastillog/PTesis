 but this... was... AWESOME!!!!!! if you consider yourself a fan of HK cinema and HAVEN'T seen this, well, YOU LOSE. oh man. we all know HK flicks pack it all in; tears, laughter, fighting, melodrama, the supernatural... and this is no exception. and the darn movie is about CHEFS for crying out loud. this is a very unique movie. and if all these 4 and 5 star reviews don't convince you, i hear they're re-making this in hollywood with Jim Carrey. (?) i just finished watching it and it is so very good. i was amazed. i think i am going to start buying more stephen chiau stuff. karen mok is wonderful. yes you've seen her in &quot;black mask&quot; and she's funny, adorable, but here she's adorable even while acting under disfiguring make-up. and i totally dug the scene where chiau jumps from the boat, ACROSS the water and then into the competition. totally crouching tiger. yes, chefs can fly too. yes. rent, borrow, BUY this movie so in the future you can say &quot;oh i saw that movie way back in...&quot
