 Stephen Sondheim's &quot;Company&quot; was a revolutionary show in the American Musical Theatre - not unlike &quot;Show Boat,&quot; &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;West Side Story.&quot; It broke new ground and expanded the medium. It set a higher standard. Considering Sondheim's genius it isn't possible to label a single score his &quot;best&quot; or his &quot;masterpiece.&quot; Truly, when you listen to the various and varied Sondheim scores one inevitably thinks &quot;this is the greatest of his achievements&quot; - which is only true until you listen to the next score and find yourself having the same thought. This DVD offers a unique look behind the scenes of the recording of the &quot;Company&quot; album. All of the best remembered songs from the score are represented - &quot;You Could Drive a Person Crazy,&quot; &quot;Another Hundred People,&quot; &quot;The Little Things You Do Together, &quot;Being Alive&quot; and the incomparable &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; featuring Elaine Stritch's knock-out performance. If you love Sondheim or Stritch or the American Musical, you shouldn't be without this DVD. Order it now
