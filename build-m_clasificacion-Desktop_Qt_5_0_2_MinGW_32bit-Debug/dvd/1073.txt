 "Nighty Night" is one of those programs that truly causes the jaw to drop, even for those of us who are accustomed to edgy comedy. It really keeps you guessing. I am a huge fan of "Strangers With Candy", and when I initially got into that, I thought... "wow, what a bizarre and politically incorrect concoction." "Nighty Night" is politically incorrect in its own hilarious way, but it seems far more "out there" to me, probably because I was raised in the US. Buttons get pushed in "Nighty Night" that simply don't happen in American programming, even on the raciest of cable programs. The writing is clever and the characters well developed. The acting is admirable, particularly on the part of Rebecca Front. It's hard to say anything about this show without giving it away, and it's a bit pointless to speak about it in really vague terms. I'd recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in quality, boundary-pushing comedy. If you're easily offended, and you think "Friends" is the best show ever, you probably won't enjoy "Nighty Night"
