 Sorry, but I have to give this DVD a negative review. First of all: what age is it really for? There are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition. Don't you think it's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old (and probably even 3)? The DVD needs much more real life objects, it sounds and looks VERY dull and boring. I always thought that children learn through play, songs, rhymes, and etc, but not through dull repetition. Even alphabet is introduced without well known "ABC song". I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend: Hap Palmer "Baby songs: ABC,123, colors & shapes"; Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder; Baby Babble - speech enhancing video; Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors); The Wiggles-"Toot-Toot"
