 "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" reminded me a bit of an Altman film--it's a story within a story about a novel being filmed--but it's really about the chaos of life. It has a bit of a amateur film feel about it, that draws one into the middle of the making of the film. The film opens with a vignette about the vanity of actors--are my teeth too yellow? do I look good with a big nose? should I get a chin tuck? am I too short? Characters move in and out, and it's not always clear who is who--the agent, the nosy journalist, the moneymen (and women), the history expert, the girlfriend, the pretty assistant, the babies. Some scenes are truly hysterical--all you need to know is that almost all of the Sterne novel happens before the narrator is born, and the filming of the birth is hilarious. This film is not for linear plot types, or those who are bothered by heavy British accents or mumbled dialog. It's sly, quirky--but I liked it much more than I expected to
