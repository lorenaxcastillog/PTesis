 "The Manchurian Candidate," another John Frankenheimer film which preceded "Seven Days In May" by two years, has drawn more critical praise, and perhaps deservedly so; its insane assassination plot against a Presidential hopeful is carried off brilliantly. Nonetheless, for my money, this film actually works a bit better, partly because of the fascinating behind-the-scenes look it provides at the workings of the Joint Chiefs and the Oval Office, partly because of a superior cast, and partly because the plot here (to overthrow a sitting President) is more plausible and thus more alarming. The love interest involving Ava Gardner is a bit of a throwaway, which is a shame because it wastes a charismatic actress. The rest of the film, however, is gripping and tightly told, and works in much the same suspense mold as "Candidate." Perhaps the best solution is just to buy them both and treat yourself to a double-feature. You'll never trust your government again (not that many of us do now)
