 With such an excellent story line, why was this viewer unable to connect with the characters and the events? I was a young man when the terror at Munich occurred - I remember with clarity and outrage. Yet, there is no real horror transmitted to the audience - only the constant confusion of watching a depressing and rambling film. I guess the people of the world must hide under their blankets and hope nothing bad happens again. Why ever take action against those who want destroy the free world? Gosh, you could make a mistake! In war, there is never a fair and balanced response - only more death and destruction. The hope is that you hurt the other side more than their capacity to hurt your side. Then, hopefully, they decide to stop and the world gets another brief respite until the next war. Avoid this film. I wish I had not seen it
