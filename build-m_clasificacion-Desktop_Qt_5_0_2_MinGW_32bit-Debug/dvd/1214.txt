 This is really good that the original trilogy without all of the added features that I remember it back in 1983 when The Return of the Jedi came out, is finally in DVD format. It took George Lucas and his crew to get it out on DVD. But once it was out, I was surprised to see it on DVD and have looked at it several times. I already have the 2004 version of all 3 movies when they came out on DVD 2 years ago. There is one drawback though, that I wished that George Lucas had the original trilogy sold without the 2004 version. It would have made it a better package for those of us who are really diehard Star Wars fans. All in all, this is worth getting and having as a collector's item, along with the original VHS versions of 1977, 1980 and 1983...without the added scenes or extras that the 1997 and 2004 versions have. This is the way I remember it back in 1977, 1980 and 1983 when they came out in the theaters.
