 The Caption listed on Amazon states that the starring actress is Barabara Anderson. The first season of MI was the very cool and sophisticated Barbara Bain. Barbara Anderson did not come on the scene until the early 70's and after that a host of different actresses. Bain made a mistake of leaving MI along with her then husband Martin Landau because of a salary dispute. As I understand it, they just did not show up for the rehearsal and taping of a particular episode. She was black balled and she is still to this day. No work for her then and even now into old age. That is too bad. I suppose she ignored the power of the then studio system. She was a fantastic actress that could have made it to the ultimate top. Martin Landau went on to become a success but it is quite different for a man in this industry. Barabara bain is in her finest hour in Mission Impossible. She will forever be rememembered as Cinnomon Carter
