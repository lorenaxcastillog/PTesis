 Don't be fooled by the title, this is a strength workout with cardio portions mixed in. Though with this workout lighter weights may be used for some of the exercises which are more compound movements where you are working upper and lower body at the same time, such as lunges with bicep curls and plie squats with shoulder raises. This would classify as more of an aerobic weight training workout, though there are some strictly weight training exercises as well. Upper and lower body is covered well, plus there is some ab work at the end. In between the strength segments, there are 3 cardio portions, one of them is low impact, and the other 2 use a step, the last one using very light weights. Allie Del Rio leads this workout along with 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who demonstrates beginning modifications. She does a nice job here, very pleasant and encouraging. You will need a Fanny Lifter or stool and assorted dumbells, this would be a good workout if you are not up for a heavy lifting day
