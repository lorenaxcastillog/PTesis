 The threads of luck, fate, music, and a sense of something eternal haunt each frame in Kieslowski's breakthrough classic. The two women(both played by Irene Jacob) inhabit a connected universe of space, thematic ideas and time . . . yet never really connect. The musical score is haunting . . . and hammers down the theme of conditional existance . . . that maybe the same person could inhabit two different places at the same time(The double Life), or different times(the judge in Red), or the same person in multiple universes(blind chance). This deja vu dreamscape vision is the backdrop for so many Kieslowski films, yet unlike my heavyhanded critique here, Kieslowski never pounds the theme over our heads. He never lectures us. He tells a great story, yet with mystery . . . drawing us in, turning the lens metaphorically at ourselves. Sometimes we like what we see. Sometimes not. But Kieslowski never insults us . . . never bores us.
