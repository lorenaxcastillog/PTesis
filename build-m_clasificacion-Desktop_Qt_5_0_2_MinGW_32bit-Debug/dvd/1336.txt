 This was a moving film. Like the city itself, it features an eclectic range of people--from the Mayor's staff down to the ordinary New Yorker. What is astounding is the plethora of media contributions, from still photos to video clips, from passersby, participants, people on the street or near the events themselves. This is a gripping film--one you are bound to remember, not just because of its extraordinary scenes but because of the moment-by-moment narrative of Mayor Giuliani and his staff and the reactions of those caught up in the horrors that unfold, but also because of the heroism, in large and small deeds, that tell you this is the true America. You will be glued to this unforgettable film--you will want to cry, but in the end you will be left with a pride and faith in human nature that you may not have anticipated. Certainly 9/11 has its political commentaries on each side of the coin, but this film is about the people who lived it. It's a keeper
