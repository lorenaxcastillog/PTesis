 The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain is the greatest English comedy set in a small village in Wales. Its about a mountain that is actually a hill, but is so beloved by its people, that they are willing to put some thousand feet of milage on it, just so it will earn the respect of the surrounding countryside. That, and the man who is measuring it. Hugh Grant. Hugh doesn't understand at first why the people are taking such an adamanet side on behalf of the hill, but gradually he is influenced by the small town comraderie and decides to help. That, and the fact that he has fallen hard for the lovely maid Tara Fitzgareld. What the deciding outcome is I won't relate, its better to see for yourself. This is a lovely movie in every sense of the word. The countryside is gorgeous, the music wondeful, and the perfomances humerous to say the least. Besides, who wouldn't want to watch Hugh Grant
