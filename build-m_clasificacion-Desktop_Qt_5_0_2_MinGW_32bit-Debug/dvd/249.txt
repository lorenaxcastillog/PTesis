 REO still rocks and this concert proves that Rock and Roll is still alive with this power performance! The band still has the youthful hunger of the early years! Lead Kevin Cronin's voice still sounds great singing favorites like:"Time for me to fly," "Don't let him go," "Take it on the run," "Keep on loving you," "Can't fight this feeling anymore," "and so many others!! I love the lead guitar in REO Dave Amato!! Awesome lead guitar gives REO a great edge! I've seen REO this summer in concert recently and saw how the audience, including me, just gravitated to the front of the stage and rocked the night away! We all knew the songs and the place became a communal atmosphere that just doesn't happen anymore with music. Luckily I happened to reach up and catch one of Kevin Cronin's guitar picks which now has a framed presentation in my bedroom. It was fun! REO has brought back a better time for music and with this concert dvd, I can relive it over and over. Don't forget the special features which are interviews with Kevin Cronin and Neal Doughty. Love it and you will too
