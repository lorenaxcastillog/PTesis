 For those who have never seen the film, it is a b-grade horror flick that deviates from many in the horror genre. First of all, it is not meant to be taken seriously, as Sam Raimi puts a lot of comical twists into this film. Also, while the film is listed as "EVIL DEAD II," it is in fact a remake and much better upgrade of the first "Evil Dead" film. There is a lot of gore in this film to be sure [b-grade style] however, there are plenty of gags and laughter also. The standout performance of Ash (Bruce Campbell) is hilarious. Especially his expressions as he is fighting the demonic forces trying to kill him in the remote cabin he cannot escape from. The film would of course lead to the third and final installment, "Army Of Darkness." And an even better upgrade of the installment of the series. But this film is an enjoyable b-horror film that is recommended. If you like b-horror, and one which is done in a strange and funny, and not to be taken too seriously way, then this is a film for you. Recommended. [Stars: 3.5]
