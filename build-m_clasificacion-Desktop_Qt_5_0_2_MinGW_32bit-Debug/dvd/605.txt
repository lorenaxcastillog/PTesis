 I was engaged and entertained by this movie more than any in a long time. I didn't care that it didn't follow the book (not having read it), or that its conclusion favored gun control (it wasn't preachy). I also wasn't bothered by far-fetched elements of the plot, any more than I was while watching House of Flying Daggers. The movie worked for me because the characters were interesting, if romantically drawn, heroes and villains. One of the best parts of the movie was watching Rachel Weisz as Marlee, a character of strength and vulnerability that was so satisfying that it was worth the sometimes unrealistic plot devices instrumental in her creation. The same for Gene Hackman as Rankin Fitch and John Cusak as Nicholas Easter. The action and dialog was partly caricature, but well-paced and engaging. The makers of this film created a coherent world within their film so entertaining, that I really didn't care if it was a bit fantastic. In fact, maybe it was so good, because it was a bit fantastic
