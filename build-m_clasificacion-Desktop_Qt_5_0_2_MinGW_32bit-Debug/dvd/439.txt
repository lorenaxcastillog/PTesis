 I see lots of complaints here essintially amounting to: "Superb danncing, but I cannot rip it off for my dance". I have heard the very same complaints about tapes from all kind of dance competitions. I have already seen several copycats of some numbers of the show, and I am pretty sure that we shall not see another video of this kind any time soon, because I am sure that the dancers are aware of rip-offs. This kind of dancing choreography takes infinitely more sweat, blood and brains than what you see in an average Las Vegas casino, and can believe what a pain it be to see it stolen and bastardized. I have been watching this show many times. Sometimes it make me go out and dance myself. Other times it makes me grieve that I will never dance like this. But it never leaves me indifferent and unchanged.
