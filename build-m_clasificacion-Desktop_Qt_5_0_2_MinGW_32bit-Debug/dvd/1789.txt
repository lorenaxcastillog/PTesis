 A great movie, loosely based on the Nam tour of the real Adrian Cronauer, as others have said. Adrian is a respected member of the Vietnam Vet community and a number of Vet friends have mentioned his take on the movie - 'If I'd done half of that stuff, Id have ended up in Leavenworth'. The movie is both a Robin Williams vehicle and a look at the first major build-up in the War itself. As for it being a 'police action', the irony was not lost on entertainers like Bob Hope, who often greeted his Nam audiences with "Hello Advisors!" even when there were more than 500,000 troops in Vietnam. In many ways this excellent movie was the first real indication of the caliber of Robin Williams as an actor. He simply shines in this role and it led to a well-deserved Oscar nomination and on to greater things. Highly recommended
