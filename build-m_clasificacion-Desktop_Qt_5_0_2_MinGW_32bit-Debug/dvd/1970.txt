 This is one of those movies that doesn't fare so well when it's originally released, but develops a cult following after the fact. I think this movie is hilarious - and it's not so much the plot as it is the performances that make the film shine. There's nothing too spectacular about the storyline. It's the day before the campers pack up to leave and everyone scrambles to end their summer right - however that may be. The cook (probably the funniest character in the movie) must learn to be honest with himself and with others. Paul Rudd's character, the pompous self-important slacker, must learn that women are not mere objects and that maybe he's not as cool as he thinks he is. Etc... It's the way the characters were given life by the performers that makes the movie so good. This is a collection of comedic actors who aren't afraid to look ridiculous - and that's why they succeed so effectively, I believe. Great movie
