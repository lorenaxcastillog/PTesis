 I stumbled upon this movie at the public library. It looked interesting although the subject matter a little "dark". All I can say is I have never, ever been more riveted my a movie in my life. Sure you say, but for me it was true. I could barely breath or move through the entire course of the movie. What unfolded on screen was beyond belief. How could mere children become so hardened and disfugured by their circumstances? The life of the children portrayed is so horrific as to suspend belief in a sane world. The filmakers unflinching lense (how they could watch what was happening with these children and remained focused on thier work is amazing enough) and the films almost real time approach make these children's lives unfold in a most tragic way. By the end of the film you are left drained and shaken to your very core. What a world we live in. And God bless the children. You must see it
