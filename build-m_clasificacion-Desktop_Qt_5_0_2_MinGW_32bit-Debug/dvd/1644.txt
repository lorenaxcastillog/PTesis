 A lot of people fail to realize that the Blade movies are based on a character from a comic book.Blade was created by Marv Wolfman for Marvel Comics(first appearence Tomb Of Dracula issue #10,I believe).So the movies should mainly be judged on those merits.Comparing the vampires in the Blade films,to other vampire flicks is somewhat irrelevant.Blade Trinity delivers well as a comic book adaption(in the comic though the Night Stalkers were actually Blade,Hannibal King and Drake,Drake who was a vampire hunter in the comics was changed to Dracula for the film,for some strange reason).This movie isnt very deep,story wise(what's there is good though).The action on the other hand is top-notch and the special effects are superb.The original Blade movie was more story-driven and Blade 2 was more darker.David Goyer took somewhat of a different approach to freshin up the franchise.The formula works well depending on how you look at it.I recommend this movie to anyone,especially comic book fans
