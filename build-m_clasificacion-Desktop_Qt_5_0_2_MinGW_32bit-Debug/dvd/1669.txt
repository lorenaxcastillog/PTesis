 Medium is a show about a "True" psychic detective; Allison Dubois. The show is pretty good drama, with a mostly excellent cast. The amazing performance of Patricia Arquette is completely believable, as the self doubting psychic, coming to terms with her abilities, dealing with a dolt of a rocket scientist husband, (who's skepticism is the most unbelievable aspect of the series), three precocious daughters who are beginning to show their mother's talents, a boss with ambivalent belief/dependency on her abilities, a wise cracking detective, and a host of evil doers, and annoying ghost. The whole point of her job is to help the DA catch some very, evil baddies, and most of the crimes are not appropriate for pre-teenagers, (which is why the show is on so late at night), so view the discs before watching with younger kids. The disc set has interesting extras such as meet the real Allison Dubois, to let you kind of make up your mind how much of the show to take seriously.. If you like crime dramas, this should be a good show for you. If you like supernatural shows, this should be a good show for you.
