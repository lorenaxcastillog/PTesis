 I recently saw an excellent romantic comedy: Kiss the Girls (1997), starring Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a talented boxing coach who falls breathlessly in love with young physician Kate McTiernan (beautifully played by Ms. Judd). Both Alex and Kate are recovering from messy divorces when they first meet at the Caf Nocturnal, a cozy little dive on the West side of Los Angeles. After a great deal of verbal sparring, they begin to date-and things get hot and heavy real quick! There is an adorable scene in which Freeman and Judd shovel dollops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream into each other's mouths, proving that racial and generational differences are relative and unimportant. The film is about love's magical ability to cross boundaries and contains oodles of on-screen chemistry between Freeman and Judd, notably when the latter gives the former a half-naked back massage. Not to be missed!
