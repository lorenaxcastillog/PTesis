 I think Jack, Helen and Greg and the dog have perfect chemistry in this tale of misfits whose relationships, forced at first, turn out to be life-saving for each. Nicholson thrills me here, and while I generally respect his work, he can be a little much in some of his performances. But I identified with him. Kinnear impressed me greatly. At the time this was released, I had not seen him act before. Hunt I knew from "Twister" and "Mad About You" on television, but this role challenged her in many ways, and she pulled it off. Recently I've going through hard times, and so have my three or four closest friends, and we have really needed each other, kind of like these folks on screen need love and friendship. I think this is a film which will gain even more affection and respect from the masses as it ages.
