 I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing. The original cast of the broadway show - save for two - are in this film and it's great. I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film. It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things. I think that there is a "RENT" character for everyone! I give the movie a 10 out of 10!!!
