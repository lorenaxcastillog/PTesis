 Ali G: meet Stuart Smalley, The Ladies Man, Pat, and the Butabi brothers. You are now in the distinguished company of your SNL cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests. Yes, Da Ali G show is hilarious, due mostly to its main character, Ali G. His interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment. You would therefore think that an Ali G who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted. And you would be incorrect, sir! The movie is a 90 minute mess. The "plot" is mentioned elsewhere on this page, so no need for me to ridicule it. But suffice it to say that the Ali G character here is a grating bore, lacking in wit or charisma. If you like Ali G, you will not like this.
