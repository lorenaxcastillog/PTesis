 Directed by Mike Nichols, the screenplay of this film was adapted by Tony Kutchner from his play. To say that it revolves around a gay man who is suffering with AIDS, while true, does not give a fair idea of its content. The man does indeed encouter an angel, played by Emma Thompson. Also in the drama is Roy Cohn, himself dying of AIDS, and haunted by hallucinations in which Emma Rosenberg, the "convicted atomic spy", appears to him. The cast of this imaginative drama includes Emma Thompson, Meryl Streep, Jeffery Wright, and Al Pacino playing Roy Cohn. Each of these actors plays multiple roles. The entire cast is outstanding. The film treats Kutchner's play with great flair and visual imagination. It is a quite gripping and believable work of imagination, in a style that might perhaps be best described as "magical realism"; and it is very well realized. In two parts, it is well worth the four hours or so spent watching it
