 Definetly among my favourite films.I love Bette Midler.Her and Lily Tomlin were perfect together in this film.This is one of those movies that are just hilariously funny from beginning to end.With several cases of mistaken identity.The trick photography that brings both sets of characters together near the movie's end is outstanding. Incidentally I recall an episode of Entertainment Tonight that compared this movie to the 1936 Laurel & Hardy feature titled Our Relations.Which had Laurel and Hardy in the same kind of mistaken identity situation.They had twin brothers named Alf Laurel and Burt Hardy.And like Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin,both sets of Laurel and Hardy characters eventually came face to face through the same source of trick photography. However there are at least two notable differences between the two films. 1:Each set of L&H characters had different first names.Whereas Bette and Lily's characters both had the exact same names. 2:The first set of Bette and Lily characters had Bette as the agressive high strung bossy character,and Lily as the more sensitive and shy character.With the other set,these personality traits were reversed.Whereas L&H's characterization format remained the same with both pairs
