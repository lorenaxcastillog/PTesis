 I LOVE TO DANCE .........SO I WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS!! WHAT A BORING DVD!! DID NOT SWEAT!! HATED HER COMPLICATED MOVES!!!!! SHE IS PRETTY BUT NOT MOTIVATING.......MY KIDS AND I JUST SAT ON THE COUCH AND WATCHED IT THINKING ANY MINUTE IT WOULD PICK UP THE BEAT! I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE REAL SPANISH LATIN AND REGGAE SONGS AND DANCING!!!!!!!!!!!! NO WAY IT WAS JUST SOME BEAT AND THESE GIRLS ALL DOING STEP TO SIDE THEN TO FRONT HANDS UP NOW TO THE SIDE......BLA BLA BLA.........WE EXPECTED UPBEAT MOTIVATING SONGS WITH LOTS OF DANCING AND FUN....I CANCELLED MY ORDER FOR ALL MY OTHER PREVENTION DVD'S ON THE WAY FOR FEAR THEY WOULD ALL BE LIKE THIS!!!! INCIDENTALLY I TRIED "PICK YOUR SPOT PILATES" FROM SOME OTHER GIRL AND IT WAS NOT ALOT OF MUSIC OR DANCE MOSTLY FLOOR EXCERCISE BUT IT WORKED AND HAD ME WANTING MORE .....SO I BLEW MY MONEY ON THIS THINKING IT WOULD BE MOTIVATING AND GIVE ME SOME CARDIO TO GO ALONG WITH THE FLOOR WORKOUT "PICK YOUR SPOT".....YOU ARE BETTER OFF TURNING ON THE RADIO AND JUMPING
