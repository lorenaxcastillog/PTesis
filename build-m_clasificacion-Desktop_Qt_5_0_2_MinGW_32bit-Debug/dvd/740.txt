 This is one of my favorite movies and really proves what a versatile actor Johnny Depp is. You must understand that this movie is making fun of those cheesy Elvis-type 50's musicals and the steroetypes that were always featured. It totally succeeds on that level - no one takes themselves seriously in this movie and everyone seems to be having a blast. Plus, the musical numbers are very enjoyable and Johnny Depp is always wonderful to look at!! I love this movie and even my children enjoy watching the dance sequences (this being a John Waters' movie, it does have some moments not for the kiddies). This is one of the movies you can watch over and over and I have done so since seeing it back when I was a teenager when it first came out. I am so glad it is now on DVD and the bonus features, especially the "making of" featurette, are quite entertaining. This movie makes me smile each time I see it and Johnny is just amazing!
