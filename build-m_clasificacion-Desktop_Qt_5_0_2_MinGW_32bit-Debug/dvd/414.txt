 The series is brilliant. This DVD release is not. Both the original and the replacement that amazon sent me were defective. Scenes would skip, certain episodes would "stick" every few seconds, some episodes and special features wouldn't play at all and would just kick you back to the main menu, and disc 1 on both copies was completely unplayable. (I would get "cannot play disc" errors.) I was afraid that maybe my DVD player was being finicky, but then I bought the first-run, individually released seasons through amazon marketplace sellers and ebay. They play just fine, with no problems. I'm not sure what happened with this release and why there are so many glitches, but my recommendation is to find some copies of the originals and buy those. They're always some used copies floating around on amazon and ebay. Mine are used, and they play great. BTW, you get pretty much the exact same extras and features with the first-run releases, with the exception of maybe a couple of things, so you're not really missing a whole lot. Plus, the boxes are sturdier
