 For those who prefer brief reviews: "IRIS" starring Judi Dench and Kate Winslet is a heart-wrenching film that speaks splendidly of LOVE: joys & sorrows all-in-one. Images of the young Iris (Kate Winslet) & the man she will marry change like a jazz segue to the characters in their older years . . . and so quickly you MUST believe that Kate & Dame Judi are the same person! Which is not to take away from the power of Jim Broadbent ~~ in his illuminating role as the elder John Bayley. So vibrant and convincing! One magical scene after another; and then, the devastation caused by what reviewer Fionan Meade called "the cruel erasure of Alzheimer's". But the themes of love and creativity cannot be diminished. Many readers & film-goers will ultimately face dealing with this disease and it will be a heart-breaking & back-breaking experience. Reviewer mcHAIKU believes there is courage to be found in this adaptation and recommends it without reservation.
