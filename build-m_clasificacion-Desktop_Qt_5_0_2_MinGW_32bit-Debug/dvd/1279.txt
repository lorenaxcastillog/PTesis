 I really liked this DVD. I already enjoy belly dancing for my husband and this DVD teaches sexy moves that can easily be combined with belly dance moves to seduce your man. Here are some perfect examples of bellydancing and striprteasing combinations. 1. Using wrist circles, which is one of the most basic belly dance moves, to emphasize hip movements when stripping. 2. Facing away from your lover, go from another basic belly dancing move, snake arms, into a striptease move, hugging yourself. 3. While doing a hip drop, a belly dancing move, do a sensual slide, a striptease move. And the 'ol bump and grind is identical to a hip circle! Ah, the fine art of seduction! Not to mention shoulder shinnies, which I still can't seem to do at all well, How frustrating! My only criticism is the end part where the striptease is demonstrated is MUCH to long. Plus, it wasn't neccessary to include the lovemaking scene. A little more instruction on exotic dancing could been substituted, such as lap dancing.
