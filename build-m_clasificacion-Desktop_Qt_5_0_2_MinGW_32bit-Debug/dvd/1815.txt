 WHAT GREAT FUN to watch some of our best contemporary entertainers pay tribute to a great talent and a class act - and all for a good cause. While everyone may not enjoy all the performances equally, each singer reminds us that JT's talent "translates well" across musical genres. Especially enjoyable is Jimmy Buffet's "video salute" to his friend, and perhaps the most touching homages come from Sheryl Crow and (later) Sting, both of whom talk about their experiences at Taylor concerts in "the early days". Taylor and his sons, Rufus and Henry, (and brother Livingston) manage to get together on-stage before it's all over. So, buy it for the music . . . buy it for the history . . . buy it for the charity . . . buy it for the FUN! You'll discover (or be reminded of) what many of us have known for a long time - it doesn't get any better than James Taylor
