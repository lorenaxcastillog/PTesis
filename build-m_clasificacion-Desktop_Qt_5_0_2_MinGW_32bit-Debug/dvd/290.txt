 At last, the eagerly awaited second series of Hart to Hart has hit the shelves. This series contains one of the classic episodes of the show, 'What Murder' where Jonathan loses his memory, forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious Jennifer. Fabulous stuff. The quality of the transfers is good, not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to! The two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes. The covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better, one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box. But hey, it's the contents that counts and you don't get much better than this! Roll on series three and please Sony, we need a commentary on 'Hart of Darkness'
