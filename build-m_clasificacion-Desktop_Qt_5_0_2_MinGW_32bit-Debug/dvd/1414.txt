 It's been about 7 or so years as far as I can remember since I last saw South Park, and I have to say, I just remember it being more funny. This movie was unbearably lame. On the tv shows, there are actually some witty lines. I just sat through this movie listening to stupid songs that weren't even funny, just the "shock value" of watching cartoons curse. The curses weren't even funny, either ... just sort of stupid 'baby talk' type profanity; what is an "Uncle F&%*er" anyways? I have to conclude that Stone and Parker are two of the most overrated guys out there. Team America World Police just sort of drifted around with again, the novelty of puppets cursing. And while I rented this film hoping to just have some stupid fun like I did years ago watching South Park on tv, it was a real disappointment. Who cares about the cursing? That's not what put me off. It was just not funny
