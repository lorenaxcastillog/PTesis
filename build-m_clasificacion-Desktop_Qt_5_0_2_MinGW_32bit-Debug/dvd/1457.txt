 Perhaps an acquired taste, this prickly satire probes the touchy subjects of moral relativism and the creeping deterioration of the American soul-- represented aptly by the modern cultural bellwether, television media-- with a sophisticated, jaded wit not seen in any film before or since. Taking equal swipes at narcissism, feminism, capitalism, commercialism, political radicalism and desperate idolatry in the context of mankind's cruel exploitation of itself, the quality of the script elevates screenplay nearly to the level of literature. The many rhetorical diatribes, which some may find heavy-handed, are delivered almost as soliloquies, entertaining (and often parodic) as dramatic device, yet each containing biting truths. Lumet's direction is tight, and Holden, Finch, Duvall, Dunaway and Ned Beatty (yes, Ned) all are in top form. More poignantly human than Broadcast News, as trenchant as A Face in the Crowd, as iconoclastic as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and funnier and more evenly paced than writer Chayefsky's previous Oscar effort, The Hospital, Network isn't just for misanthropes and malcontents-- anyone with a wry sense of humor and a keen concern for the fate of Western civilization is free to enjoy
