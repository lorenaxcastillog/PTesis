 Appleseed is anime sci-fi cyberpunk with shades of Bubblegum Crisis 2040 and Ghost In The Shell. The story is about Deonan, a young female urban warrior who is taken to a city called Utopia. Half the population of Utopia is human, half is a race called Bioroids. Bioroids are there to keep the human population in emotional balance and to prevent fights, crime, and war. Deonan becomes friends with a kind and gentle Bioroid named Hitomi. Deonan meets her former comrade at arms/lover who is now a machine, but his mind, memories, and feelings are intact. Soon it becomes clear that there is something sinister about Utopia. Can Deonan make the right decision by trusting the last words of her dying mother? Or is she making a terrible mistake and thereby condemning humanity to extinction? The settings and action are tremendous. The robots and machines look great, but the humans, especially the human women, look plastic and fake.
