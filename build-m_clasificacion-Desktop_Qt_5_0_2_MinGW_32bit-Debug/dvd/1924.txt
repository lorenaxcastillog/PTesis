 This documentary is about as good as it gets. I always feel uneasy with the fact that human beings invariably alter their behavior when cameras are focussed on them. Still, Liz Garbus helps us to find out what makes these young ladies tick. The leftist intellectual community has encouraged American citizens of color to perceive themselves as victims of a racist society. Adhering to society's norms is often considered as selling out to the wider white establishment. It is therefore not surprising that Shanae and Megan have the odds stacked against them. They reside in neighborhoods were vile rap music and sexually promiscuity are glamorized. Shanae was even raped before her twelfth birthday. During a fight, She stabbed to death another young girl. Oddly enough, Shanae is far less troubled than Megan. The latter teenager lacks a viable family structure and will likely become a drug user and prostitute like her mother. Shanae probably already has earned a college degree. Megan, on the other hand, may be lucky if she could graduate out of grade school. It would be interesting if Ms. Garbus might soon possibly provide us with a four year update. David Thomson Flares into Darknes
