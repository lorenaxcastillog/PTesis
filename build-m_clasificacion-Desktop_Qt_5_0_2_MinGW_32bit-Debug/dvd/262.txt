 You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good. This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny. The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked. I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks). That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people. This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).
