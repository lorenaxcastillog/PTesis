 What filth. What utter tripe. As if the early 90's didn't have enough "White People Bad, Everyone Else Good" movies, along comes this sick, unimaginative, racist garbage. I see by the ratings that many viewers like this movie (some of whom appear unable to spell the most primitive words the English language has to offer). Let me ask you wannabe vatos locos this....if this movie had been about white people instead of Latino people, would you have thought this movie was racist? Think about it...white people starting gangs on the street and in prison based on the principle of outkilling and outbreeding other races of people? Oh, but when non-white people do it, suddenly it's not racist. More BS Hollywood double-standard bigoted drivel. By the way, how is your Vatos Locos movement doing? Hmm? Has it been producing successful members of society, or just more fodder for prison gang rape? Exactly. You were racist, degenerate losers back then, and you're racist, degenerate losers now. Though I doubt you'll ever learn. Vatos locos forever! Ha ha ha ha ha what an absolute joke. What an insult to humanity. Grow up
