 The historical fiction upon which this miniseries was based was absolutely terrific, and the resulting film was equally grand... except: Robert Mitchum was too old for the part, and there were too many ponderous scenes of vehicles en route somewhere. The scene is a country road, and in the distance we see an auto approaching. It comes closer and closer, then closer and closer -- and then turns a corner, and you see the car driving away down another road. You see it get farther and farther away. The irritation one feels from reading that description is repeated throughout the film. In the novel(s), Pug Henry was an athletic, formidable (though short-ish) man in his early fifties, and credibly could have commanded the affection of a younger woman such as Pam Tudsbury. Robert Mitchum simply did not -- but, the high quality of the film in other respects overpowers that one casting problem.
