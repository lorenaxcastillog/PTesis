 I was absolutely, hopelessly hooked on CSI from the first time I watched it. I started with Season 1 (never saw it on t.v., just started watching the DVDs) and am now on Season Three. This has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the CSIs is amazing, the story lines are fresh, and it has quickly become my favorite drama (with 24 being a VERY close second). Only one thing about the other reviews -- yes, Nick's character is gorgeous, but how about that Warrick? He's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous, but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face, body -- everything. Grissom is also attractive because he's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything. Sara has a great voice, and well I could say something great about all of the character's physical qualities, but the most important thing is that the show is captivating, innovative, and fresh. Season after season, you're drawn into each and every story line. I love CSI and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years
