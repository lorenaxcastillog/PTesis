 Being a huge fine of MM like I am, I just bought this package on a whim. I was not disappointed. The package has "The Big One", "Bowling For Columbine", and a separate DVD about "Dude, Where's My Country" tour that he did last year. The Bowling for Columbine DVD has 4 hours of extras including his Oscar acceptance speech and interviews. In the separate DVD, MM talks about how we need representation in our congress - like if there are 10% Greens(Independants, democrats, etc) in the U.S. - there should be 10% Greens in congress, he also talks about looking at other media sources besides the U.S. to find out what's actually going on here because our media doesn't tell us or ask the questions that they should. Bowling for Columbine is about gun control and The Big One is about corporate downsizing and greed. Moore's work is always stuff which leaves you happy, thoughful and full of will to make a positive change. You will learn a lot
