 This is a great light and funny comedy that I think everybody can enjoy. It does have a bit of violence but it is not over the top with it. Hanks is his usual funny self and this is one of his early roles before he became the serious icon that he has become and rightly so. But the STAR of the movie is HOOCH the Dogue de Bourdeaux (or French Mastiff). This dog has the most charisma I have ever seen in a dog. The big red beautiful (in the eyes of the beholder)beast has everything it takes to steal the spotlight from Tom Hanks and everybody else in the movie. He is at the same time one of the ugliest and cutest animals ever on film. The dog has the chops, the look and the acting ability to make Turner and Hooch and all time favorite for both adults and kids (maybe not too young though cause of the crime plot) but watching Hanks play off the dog is hilarious.
