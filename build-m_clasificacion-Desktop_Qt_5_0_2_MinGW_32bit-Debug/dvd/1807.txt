 TO BE AND TO HAVE...it is so hard to put into words...but it probably is one of the BEST documentaries ever. What takes place in a rural French school house is unlike anything you will ever see and experience. It is so reminiscent of times past where children are in their purest form--interacting with one another in such an innocent way...untouched by our western society...it is hard to believe there is still such a place that exists. The teacher, Mr. Lopez, is a person who clearly understands his place in the lives of these children. And his love of teaching children is so evident through out this film. This was an exreme joy to watch and yet a painful realization of how far our educational system has strayed. I can only hope and pray that we can get back to the basics--of protecting our children, loving & nurturing them and teaching them the simple joys of life. If you have not seen this film, you must. It will transform you.
