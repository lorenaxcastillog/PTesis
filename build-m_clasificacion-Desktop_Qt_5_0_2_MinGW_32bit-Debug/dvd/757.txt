 I had no idea what this film was going to be about. It turned out to be quite thought provoking and a stupendous love story. I wont retell the plot because everyone else has done that. The characters and the acting were superb. In the beginning, the small town lawyer wife thinks she's quite a tough-guy. That's her personna so when the carpet is pulled out from beneath her she is totally destroyed and has to re-think her concept of herself. So does the son. They all must.. except the angelic small daughter who welcomes dad back without a blink of an eyelash. This film is quite a love story despite the incredible amount of violence. Did the son inherit a fight-to-kill gene from his dad I wonder? William Hurt gives an distractingly accurate impersonation of someone from northeast Philadelphia but in my opinion, Ed Harris sounded like he was from the Bronx.
