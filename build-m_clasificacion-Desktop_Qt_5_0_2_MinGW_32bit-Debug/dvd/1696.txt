 I purchased the wonderful sign language DVD "My Baby Can Talk" for my son Max when he was 6 months old & from the start loved the content - it's made so well, he was enthralled from the first sign. I have video of him watching the DVD for the first time & it's amazing how it totally captured his attention. He actually began signing ("more") at 9 months & his daddy & I were so thrilled! In early April 2006 I got the 2nd DVD, & Max (then 16 months old) took to it again immediately. He began signing many of the new words that same day. To my surprise it only took two days for him to understand "help" which I was amazed at since it's a concept & not something I could easily point to (like a tree). Max knows about 35 signs now (for example, in addition to the very helpful "more", there's eat, milk, drink, cereal, dog, cat, bird, ball, go, car...) - he's so proud to be able to communicate with us & we love it
