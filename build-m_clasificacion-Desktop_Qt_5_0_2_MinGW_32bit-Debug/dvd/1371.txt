 Leonard Cohen is a poet extrodanaire. He is unbelievable. And the performes in this movie are all excellent. I had never even heard of Rufun or Antony, but WOW! And those two women who sung "Anthem" blew me away. Leonard Cohen is not just another pretty face. His intelligence glows from him. His brilliance, his turn of a phrase, everything about his words and music move me. And to learn that he had became a Zen monk. I just can't say enough about this master poet and song writer. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, if you are not a Leonard Cohen fan you will be. It had been years since i listened to him i had all but forgotten about him, and then them movie came out and i am blown away. I want so much to buy it but don't know if it will ever be available. God Bless Leonard Cohen, his music will endure forever
