 I saw this film (again after many years)just last night. I loved the Ray Walston mention of The Rockingham Race Track in Salem, NH which I used to actually see in person going up to Salem a lot. Also, the film's golf scene reminds of the one in the James Bond film Goldfinger (Robert Shaw, whose in this scene in The Sting, wasn't in Goldfinger as he was in the James Bond film From Russia With Love). It's a very good film overall with characters that are not that larger than life. Credible way how Redford alludes getting shot by Shaw's men for one. But I hate Saddam Hussein and the film made me wish someone in real life really had stung him right out of power before he committed his dreaded Anfal Campaign in the 1980's. At least Saddam was very rightfully taken out of powerin 2003. Thank God for Bush
