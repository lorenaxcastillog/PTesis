 Brilliant, everything in this anime is brilliant! Animation is one of the best I've seen, so are the sound. It reminds me alot of "Berserk", both the darkness and the storytelling. The story starts off with Brandon as a dead(revived) man, which then continues with watching his earlier life, with realistic episodes, the story and characters developes as never before, one of the best starts I've seen. Later on, it becomes weird and very unrealistic, and with abit less story, and more shooting, but that's just a few episodes, and it's never too much of anything. I think the end was very brilliant, I loved it, although it was very sad and depressing(that's abit of a plus). Overall I can't possibly say anything bad about this anime apart from a few(1-2) less entertaining episodes. I'll say as "panda"; I don't think any other anime has ever touched me this much. It will with no doubt end up as one of my absolute fav. series
