 Rather than "Menace to Society", this movie should be titled, "The Unfortunate Victims of a Racist Society". My heart bleeds for the real-world counterparts of these young men, caught up in the unending battle for survival in South-central LA, and other such areas all around the country. I understand that we all make choices, but how many do these young men have? It is a racist, exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate; to die violently at the hands of their own brothers. Its sickening. Society is more of a menace to these young men, than they are responsible for being a menace to society. Having said that, the movie itself is excellent. It's gritty and real to the 'nth' degree. Movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be' in this country, but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed
