 This gives you all you want in a western; guns, fights, dirty cowboys, a bank heist, ambushes, wide open scenery and awesome wild horse rides all with a high body count (almost every single character dies). However real the tough terrain is (I felt like I was there on the dusty planes, riding a horse) the story is at times unbelievable. The sometimes problem is Mickey Rourke, who does not come close to ruining the movie, but somehow over-acts and under-acts at the same time. Rourke plays it too aloof almost detached from the entire movie. I wish he had more fire or creative quirks. Rather he just stands there, whispering menacing things without clear motives. When he is in action, he seems kinda slow and too deliberate. Overall Rourke does not appear "cowboy". His goth/pirate wardrobe and make-up do become distracting. But a strong cast (unfortunately I don't recall one female in this movie),strong directing, great horse rides and inspired scenery saves a script with some holes and a slow motion outlaw played by Rourke.
