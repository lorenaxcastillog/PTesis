 I enjoyed this season very much. I found it more cohesive than the first season. I liked that one to, but part of the way in I wasn't sure where it was going. It sort of lagged, seemingly unsure just what it had gotten itself into. In this one, though, there's a clear movement forward from the start - even if the plot is quite convoluted. It feels like the writers and the actors have really settled into the skin of the characters and the setting. They speak and act wonderfully, each of them representing different areas of society, speaking differently depending on who they're speaking too, etc. Very well done. I'm looking forward to what comes next and ever so thankful that HBO has the guts to do programs like this. Who would've thought a cable channel would end up making some of the best stuff out there - even better and grittier than much of what's on the big screen these days
