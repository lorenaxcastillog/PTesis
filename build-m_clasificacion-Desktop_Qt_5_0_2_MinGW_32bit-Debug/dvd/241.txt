 If you're a fan of musical theatre, you're almost guaranteed to find something you like on this DVD. Although the presentation is cheesy (with some awful bluescreen effects), the musical numbers themselves are entertaining. Highlights include Patti LuPone in Evita, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago and Bonnie Franklin in Applause. But for me, as a fan of both the musical theatre and science fiction, the higlight was seeing a young Nana Visitor (Major Kira on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) dance her little heart out in an impressive dance number from My One and Only. In this particular number, you will also see a less than comfortable Twiggy trying to keep up with the rest of the dancers. She looks so out of place next to Tommy Tune. One of the few performances I didn't like was Betty Buckley singing Memory from Cats. Her singing was okay, but I just didn't buy her as a "cat"... Other than that, this DVD should warm the hearts of musical lovers around the world
