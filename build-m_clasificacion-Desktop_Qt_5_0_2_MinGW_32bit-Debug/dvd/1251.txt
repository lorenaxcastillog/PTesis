 This director also did "Rocky" and "The Karate Kid". A small, enjoyable film about a real-life bronco bull rider named Lane Frost who became a world champion in his early 20s. Cynthia Geary, who plays his wife, sure looks like she is Jessica Lange's daughter. The resemblance is remarkable. And the intense scenes of bull riding. Why on earth would any man want to do that for a living? The film really showed the bone-jarring that goes on, and the very real danger once a man is off. Lane Frost was killed before he had a chance to live. Somehow, just to be the best at bronco bull riding, while providing entertainment for the crowds, does not seem a worthy endeavor to lose your life over. The actor who played Lane's dad, James Rebhorn, has been around awhile, and is very good. In fact, he later starred in the wonderful "Babe". But Geary is not so very good. She has all of Jessica Lange's woodenness without the intensity inside. The music was good, country, and so was Stephen Baldwin.
