 As far as the picture was concerned, I loved it. You noticed the background and the lighting is 100% better that previous versions. Then you'll also notice some of the colors are brighter or different. I believe most will appreciate the visual aspect of the film. It will blow your mind if you have a HiDef. TV. Ok the bad side is for those who have high end stereo equipment. The audio format is just plain old regular stereo. I wish that it was in a DTS format or at least 5.0 digital. It would be more complete if they upgraded the sound. For those who never seen this movie, it IS a classic for you DVD collection. It's a movie that you will watch again and again. Because the more you watch it, the deeper the story get. This is a movie that has a lot of color as far as the picture. The story however was not intended to be a clear black and white story. It falls into different shades of grey. I can say I have a different opinion about the story in 1982 that I do now
