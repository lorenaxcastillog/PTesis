 Mr. Show, season Three, is quite possibly one of the funniest things you will ever see. Unless you're blind, then you're SOL. The mad minds behind the first two brilliant seasons, Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, return to reprise their roles as "Bob" and "David" (apart from understudy Kedzie Matthews, who takes over for Bob when he has to go shopping). They bring the funny, they make you laugh, they make you wonder how such a glorious creation could exist in the absence of a just and caring God. Quite simply, this is the finest American sketch comedy I've ever seen (and yes, I have seen Mad TV). If you want smart, savvy, hip and hilarious comedy...this will have to do. No, it's better than that. It will change your life. I used to be in debt all the time, then I got Mr. Show...I'm still in debt, but the laughter they elicit in me distracts from my gnawing hunger pains! Anyway, get this when you can (preferably before the Rapture)
