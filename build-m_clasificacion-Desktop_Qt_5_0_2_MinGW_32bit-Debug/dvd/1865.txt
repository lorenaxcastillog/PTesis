 I'm a young guy, but I've long been a fan of Angela Lansbury and her work. As a kid I first saw her in MURDER, SHE WROTE and was always impressed how she managed to make each show interesting without the need for things found in most modern television shows, namely graphic violence, foul language, and sexual innuendo. Each episode was more of a character study than other shows of the time, focusing more on the relationships between one person and another than allowing each death to come off as some random act of violence. In any event, this show is truly marvelous due in large part to Ms. Lansbury's performance. While the first three seasons on DVD were released on double-sided discs, this season has finally been released on single-sided ones. Hopefully this will improve the playback quality, as many viewers (myself included) had problems with the dual-sided discs not playing correctly. I have had no problems with this set of discs and look forward to the next season being released (hopefully soon!). Truly a great show that I'm delighted to see has finally been given the treatment it deserves. Very highly recommended
