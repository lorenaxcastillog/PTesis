 My little girls, ages 2 and 4, were first exposed to Dan Zanes on Playhouse Disney. They quickly grew to love his music, his smile and his band. After purchasing a couple of his cds which became huge hits both in the house and in the car we decided to buy the dvd. This investment was a great one! The dvd consists of two segments. The first segment is an actual Dan Zanes and Friends concert, obviously but skillfully edited, which my girls absolutely love. The energy of the band and the crowd is apparent and when Father Goose makes his appearance it never fails to bring a huge smile to their faces. The second segment of the dvd is a compilation of professional videos of some of their songs. A few will be familiar to the Playhouse Disney crowd but there are also some new ones, all of which are a joy to listen to and watch. I'd highly recommend this dvd to anyone looking to bring good, clean musical fun into their homes
