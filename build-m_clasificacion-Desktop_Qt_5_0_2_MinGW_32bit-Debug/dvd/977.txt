 this is a great season to be owned by die hard simpsons fans or by fans that are not so obsessed. it features classic episodes such as the return of burns' long lost son (voiced by rodney dangerfield), homer eating insanity peppers and having a psychodelic talk with a coyote (voiced by johnny cash), sideshow bob's brother trying to blow up springfield's dam, homer becoming the voice of poochy the dog on itchy and scratchy, homer gets an arch-nemisis named frank grimms (or grimmy as he "liked" to be called), bart works at the maison derrier, and the x-files cameo episode where mulder and scully investigate an alien encounter in springfield. it also has a great halloween episode (but come on, they're always great). it does feature my least favorite episode (the shary bobbins episode), but i hate musicals. commentary on all episodes, deleted scenes, and the interesting foreign language audio (homer seems offish in every language)
