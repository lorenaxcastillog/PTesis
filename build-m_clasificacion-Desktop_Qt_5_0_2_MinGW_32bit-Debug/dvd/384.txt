 I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The layered reality (writers playing writers playing actors playing themselves) keeps you on your toes. The cinematic device of organic storytelling is enhanced by cutaways in both time and space to scenes of what we are to assume is each character's present reality outside the theater at the time when the story takes place back to the image of the storytellers in a narrative about these events that have already taken place, and again out to their experience coming to knowone another under Dom DeLuise's direction in the same theater (in the past). Really, it's an interesting device. Production values are high and this film is pretty funny. . .and sexy. . .and revealing. While I wouldn't necessarily call it cinematic genius, gay movies dealing with any kind of plot beyond coming out are few and far between. This film is very much about relationships-how they fall apart and how they are born. The fact that these are lesbian relationships is just the cherry
