 I am by no means a fan of musicals but I have to say I love "Little Shop of Horrors", or at least Frank Oz's adaptation. Rick Moranis plays the dorky but sweet Seymore who works in a flower shop with Ellen Greene as Audrey and Vincent Gardenia as Mr. Mushnik, his boss. Seymore is secretly in love with Audrey who is in an abusive relationship with a demented dentist played by the hilarious Steve Martin who is really over the tops in this film. One day, Seymore stumbles upon a new kind of plant. He takes it back to the store with him. He names the plant Audrey II. For awhile the plant appears that it is not going to make it but then one day it suddenly comes alive when Seymore discovers the plant likes blood. Eventually the plant grows and his blood thirst even more so. I absolutely love the musical numbers in the film. I especially love the number where Seymore fantasizes about a live with Audrey. The performances were wacky and over the top. I hope someday this dvd will get a proper dvd treatment. It richly deserves so
