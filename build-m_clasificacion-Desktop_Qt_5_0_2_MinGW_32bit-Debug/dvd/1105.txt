 The year was 1994. Radiohead was soon to release their brilliant sophomore album "The Bends" coming off of a large tour promoting their debut smash "Pablo Honey." This concert mixes material from both. While I am definitely more of a fan of The Bends than Pablo Honey, it is always a delight to see "Creep," their infamous hit single. Several other tracks from the first album stood out as well (most notably "You" and the grand finale of "Blowout" which is worth the price of admisson by itself.) Other highlights included "The Bends", "My Iron Lung", "Just", and a truly hypnotic "Street Spirit." Any fan of Radiohead would be insane not to own this (if not just to see Thom with his hair died blonde and Phil WITH HAIR.) Overall, the songs range from good to mind-blowing which leaves the show with a rating of VERY GOOD. Jonny Greenwood is spectacular with the rest of the group feeding off of his wild energy. And as always, Thom Yorke is so entertaining to watch. This is what rock and roll is all about
