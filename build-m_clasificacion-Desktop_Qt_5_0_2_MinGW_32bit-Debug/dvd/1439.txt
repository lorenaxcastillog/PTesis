 It is very difficult to understand why Todd Field's 'In the Bedroom' was completely unrepresented in the Oscar winners list in 2001. However this is not the first glaring error that the academy have made and it won't be the last. Andre Dubus' quality writing delivers us an enchanting an involving relationship between single mother Natalie and young college bound Frank. This relationship is one of the areas in which 'In the Bedroom' succeeds where so many other films have fallen flat on their faces. Here the love between the characters is truly believable and the viewer is drawn into an attachment and identification with them that is uncommon in modern Hollywood movies. The second, more sombre phase of the film is beautifully rendered and heart breaking. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson deliver wondeful performances that should have had more recognition in terms of awards. Here the film portrays grief and loss with an emotive impact that is rarely seen in cinema. If you are a viewer who is interested in a film which delivers a vivid depiction of the gamut of human emotion, then 'In the Bedroom' is unmissable
