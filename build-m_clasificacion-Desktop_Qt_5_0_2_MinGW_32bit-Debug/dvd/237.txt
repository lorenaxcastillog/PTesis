 Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington. This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting. Exciting. Smart casting and directing. Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past. This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride. Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer. Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal. This film had all aspects of our human nature. What more can anyone ask for. It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught?
