 I pretty much know the origin for these type of DVDs. We have the Walt Disney Treasures sets for hardcore animation fans. So these Classic Cartoon Favorites DVDs are for parents who want to keep the kids busy in front of the TV, and for those who want the very best of Disney's cartoons. The Disney's Sports DVD contains eight cartoons, five of which are Goofy's best sport cartoons, especially "How To Play Baseball". Also it has my favorite Donald Duck cartoon "The Hockey Champ", where Donald battles a game of Hockey with his three nephews; "Canine Caddy", starring Mickey and Pluto in a game of Golf; and "Mickey's Polo Team", Mickey and the Gang plays Polo against a team of celebrites, a few of which are Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. Disney Sports fans will rejoice for this one. And although it's a bare bones release (meaning no extras), it's still great to buy for the above^ reasons
