 So what have y'all been smoking? Sure, Jessica Simpson can sing (especially in her beginnings with 1999's lukewarm smash Sweet Kisses), but not particularly on this DVD. She has some serious vocal affections that hinder her natural sound and distort her pop croonings (she comes off as a Britney wannabe). Interestingly her more tepid and boring tunes from In This Skin sound the best (including "My Way Home"). Her rendition of "Take My Breath Away" is decent, as is the touching "You Don't Have to Let Go" (her "I can love because you love...me" is nothing less than beautiful), but her awful performance of "Angels" falls extremely short of expectations (she sounded much better on VH1's Divas Live). In the end, her Reality Tour 2004 is a decent but much less stellar concert given by a girl who does have talent. Throw out that Britney-trademarked growl, Jessica, and the odd vocal quirk that makes it sound as though she's choking back a song rather than singing it and you can soar. Decent, but not great.
