 City by the Sea brings to the screen the story of a police officer who finds himself stuck between a rock and hard place as he has to arrest his own son. It is a movie about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, inner strength, courage, sacrifice, and how love can overcome and prevail even in the most difficult of situations. Robert De Niro, James Franco and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful! In conclusion, City by the Sea is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment; it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.
