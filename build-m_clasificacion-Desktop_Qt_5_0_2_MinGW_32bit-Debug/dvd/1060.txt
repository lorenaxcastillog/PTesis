 Well, nothing I say will be new considering the number of reviews but here goes: I have never seen anyone get into character like Ricky Gervais did for David Brent, the transformation is total. Even after watching the series and seeing Ricky in interviews it's hard to believe they're not two distinct people. The super-ego of David Brent is so hard to reconcile with Ricky's humble nature. The humor on the show is top notch almost completely subtle, even the extremely obtuse humor is funny on a subtler level. The two episodes which comprise the Christmas specials, as The Dude would say, really tie the series together and leave me with a feeling of closure with regard to the series. The supporting cast did their jobs perfectly, each normal in their own way with the exception of Garreth. This normality highlights the ridiculous nature of David's ego and cognitive dissonance and makes his character even more hilarious / uncomfortable. Perhaps most importantly, the feeling that the cast is having a lot of fun comes across the more you watch it. Thanks, Ricky and Steven for creating this spectacular and unforgettable series!
