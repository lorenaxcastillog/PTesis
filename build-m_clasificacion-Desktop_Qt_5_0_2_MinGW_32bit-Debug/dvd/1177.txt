 I have the Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart - they are still great, but especially when my daughter was 7-12 months. We bought Baby Noah for her 1-year birthday and she LOVES it, and when we watch Beethoven and Mozart I almost feel like she's already outgrown them. This one is definitely a little more advanced - for a slightly older child. The music is great because it's stuff that an adult would like to listen to also - it doesn't get on my nerves like the other 2 DVD's did after a while. For example, when they play the music for the Tropics, it's steel drum and so catchy. My daughter is fascinated by this one, and gives me a great time out for a few minutes if I need to run do something (baby is safely in her play yard, of course!) If you buy this DVD - you won't be sorry
