 For better or worse, this film really represents an era, particularly in So Cal. This film is superficial but bright and smart... and has VERY bright colors -- like a 90 minute Starburst commercial. The entire look, in every nook and cranny, is eighties glitzy-junk new wave excess taken to the extreme. And then grunge (Seattle, Nirvana, Clinton:-) put an end to it all, sort of. But while it lasted, the end of the eighties ($ boomtime for So Cal) is shown here in all its glory: Yuppiedom, lots of gadgets, almost disposable clothes, accesories to the max, disposable pop-culture references, and big-haired beautiful women. Julie Brown epitomizes all of the above with a postmodern wink. She is the heart here... while Geena Davis is the straight person, properly vacant, wandering through this neon world. As so many reviewers wrote, the Julie Brown musical numbers are real standouts. And Geena's &quot;Ground That You Walk On&quot; is great too. Highly recommended time capsule. (Compare this film to 1980ish &quot;Xanadu,&quot; where lots of this glitz was in its infancy, more serious and innocent)
