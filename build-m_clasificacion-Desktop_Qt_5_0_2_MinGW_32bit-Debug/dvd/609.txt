 One Star is evidently the required minimun. This documentory, in my opinion, distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda. If you are looking for the truth, you won't find it here. There are people who, by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other Americans, spread mis-information for one or more reasons: for personal or political agenda, or both; and/or, in some cases, such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country. This is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent Americans consider Anti-American as evidenced by the nature of their words, acts, and reasoning. They have a right say their piece and present their documentary, regardless of their motive. CAUTION: Beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives! When a person, organization, or government wants to see America harmed and Americans dead, I, being an American, consider their comments as a serious threat to Americans, American interest and America's security. Americans who doen't consider such declorations as a threat are either stupid/ignorant people or my enemy; there is no third option.
