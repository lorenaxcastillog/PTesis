 Okay, let me start off by saying, why I loved this movie so much. I love this movie because I feel like I can relate to the characters so well. I imagined them being in their late 30's (I'm in my early 40's now, but was in my late 30's when it came out) and I often times fantasize about doing college over again, and how much better it would be. That in a nutshell, is what is so appealing to me about this movie. It is ensued halarity that I could imagine doing myself, or at least in a "movie fantasy" sense. And that draws you in to the story. Other details which draw you in are: 1)Luke's character is at an offsite meeting 2)Luke's office workplace scenes 3)Vince's family problems 4)Will's marriage failure (that's the world's shortest marriage I've ever seen) etc. Throwing in Snoop Dog appearing live at one of their parties, and Will running down the street naked is just icing on the cake. This movie should be seen by every college student, male and female, and every 30 something wanna be college graduate! Two thumbs up! MC White said check it out!
