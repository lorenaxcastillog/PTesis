 Body Sculpt, led by Firm instructor Jen Carman, is a challenging total body sculpting workout. The video is formatted so you could split up what areas of the body you work on different days. The workout is divided into several segments beginning with a 6 minute warm-up. That is followed by a TOUGH lower-body workout. It seems like the leg presses on the fanny lifter are endless, but in a good way! They are difficult, but you know you will see results. There is a five minute stretching transition before a 15 minute upper-body workout. The video concludes with a final stretch and cool-down. You do need the FannyLifter or a step stool and three sets of weights (such as 3,5, and 8 pounds). Jen is a motivational instructor - which you need for such a tough workout! Definitely a worthwhile addition to your fitness collection, especially if you love the Firm's videos, as I do!
