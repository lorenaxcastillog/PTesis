 My wife raved about this movie for months before I actually sat down and watched it, and after the credits began to roll I think I enjoyed it more than she did. What I expected to bore me to tears in actuality kept me well entertained for its entire duration. The story of an elderly stubborn southern woman named Daisy and her chauffeur Hoke rose from ashes of mediocrity and became a brilliantly scripted and acted film about learning to accept people for who they are on the inside, not on the outside. Jessica Tandy is brilliant as Daisy. When she crashes her car her son Boolie (Aykroyd) makes it known she can no longer drive and hires a chauffeur for her. That chauffeur is quite and well mannered Hoke (Freeman), a black man who wins over Daisy's heart, and ours too, with his mild manner and caring concern for his employer. The chemistry between the two of them is so spot on it makes the entire film a delight. I'm not surprised it won for best picture, I'm delighted!
