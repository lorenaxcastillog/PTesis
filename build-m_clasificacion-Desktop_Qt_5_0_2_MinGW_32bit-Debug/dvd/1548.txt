 Voodoo Academy is a fun movie. It dosent take itself serioussly and its very funny. A boy named Christopher Sawyer enrolls in a bible college and the head mistress accepts him and he soon meets his roomates and the reverend and strange things start to happen. At night the boys start having ( nightmares) which look more like they are having wet dreams and they go off to the head mistres's room/Christopher cant figure out whats going on at first but he has his suspicions and soon figures out what is going on-the head mistress is trying to turn them into voodoo dolls to chanel satan. This movie is hilarious and gay men and women/maybe even straight men will like this. The boys are gorgeous and 2 of them have been in previous or more recent films lately. The reverend and the boy in the cofession booth is a really good scene and the nightmare scenes. I especially liked the sarcastic blond kid, he was really funny. I recomend this film for a laugh or anyone who likes boys in boxer briefs or anyone who just likes a funny movie
