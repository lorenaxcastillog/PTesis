 The year is 2030 and the "real" world has become increasingly confused with the world wide net. Some humans have taken on prosthetic bodies giving them greater access to the cybernetic world plus greater physical strength and speed. Need a new body? Just transfer your brain case to a new one! Major Motoko Kusanagi, one of the top agents of Section 9 (a anti-cyber terrorist task force), is one such cyborg. Her organization will have to deal with murderous robot geishas, a runaway tank, sex-slave suicides, and the reappearance of the infamous "Laughing Man", a legendary cyber-terrorist who once blackmailed some of the largest companies in the world. Ghost in the Shell SAC takes place in the same world as the first Ghost movie but does not fit within its continuity. The animation here is first rate, with subtle shadows, hair motion, and fast moving action. There are no motionless painted scenes to be found here. The feel and pace of the show is more like a film than a tv series. All the characters are appealing and interesting. Great show
