 Don't want to create a war from the previous reviewer, but after watching this fun flick last night, I have to throw my 2 cents in. If you are looking for a deep, touching, sensitive and moving film then don't bother with this one (the cover art clearly shows you what to expect). Also if you're the kind of person who doesn't appreciate the beauty of a dirty joke, then move on to something else. Now if you are looking for something different, hysterical, and funny, then BUY THIS NOW! We (myself and 6 friends) watched this last night and we were laughing so hard we were crying. In fact, we had to pause it several times as we couldn't control our laughter as we were missing the continuing dialogue. And I think that's what this film is all about.........to be fun and entertaining. I don't think the writers/producers/directors/actors had high hopes of an Oscar. And too clarify my rebuttal in my title......"America did prove to be British in approach"...... these artists took comedy ala Benny Hill and but a gay twist to it.
