 I already have the pick your spot dvd by Ellen and I love it. This one really takes it up a notch. I felt great afterwards and I found out that I am really weak in my upper body so I am excited that this workout might change that. I did find the yoga segment a bit repetitive but at least it wasn't too challenging for me since this is my first experience with yoga. As usual there is someone doing a less challenging version of some of the exercises which I took advantage of a couple of times. I like having something to work toward. Someone who is in great shape will probably like this workout on days when they want to do a light workout but for people like me who are trying to get in shape it is awesome and will really challenge you without being too difficult
