 When I sat down to watch The Brood, I wasn't expecting much. I thought that because it was one of Cronenberg's earlier films it would be less accomplished than his later work. Happily, I was in for a suprise. From the opening scenes to the closing credits, the film held me riveted. David Cronenberg's imagination runs rampant throughout, and the dialogue and acting are both first-rate. The inevitable gore is used with great effect and a degree of restraint. This is a truly suspenseful movie that achieves genuine spine-tingling moments. The only reason I rated The Brood 4 instead of 5 stars is because there are some plot holes that become more apparent as the end approaches. I also felt that some behaviors of certain characters were not adequately justified. However, I didn't consider these things until after the movie was over, which speaks to Cronenberg's ability to achieve a suspension of disbelief. This is not just a great horror movie, but a great movie period. It deserves greater recognition than what it has received. For me, The Brood now rivals Videodrome as my favorite Croneberg film
