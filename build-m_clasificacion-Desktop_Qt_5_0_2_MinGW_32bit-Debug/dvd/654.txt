 It's hysterical and pitiful that some of the other 'reviewers' describe this program as though it is some subversive, dangerous, dogmatic propaganda. WARNING: This program teaches children to love themselves and respect others and we all know how threatening and subversive those values are! Quick run back to the cave and hide! The sky is falling!! If you believe little boys playing with dolls is sick and threatens their development, then you won't like this program. If you think it's subservise propaganda to tell little girls it's okay for them to be smart and strong, then you won't like this program either. On the other hand, if you are a nurturing parent and some of your goals include teaching your child to have a sense of self, to respect humanity's differences (gasp!) and to empower (double gasp!) them to reach for the stars, then you'll enjoy sharing this program with your kids
