 I had never seen Guys and Dolls before. I didnt know what it was about, but my father had seen it on the stage and thought it was great. I bought this movie blind. I have always liked musicals, so I thought 'why not?' I noticed that Marlon Brando was in it and thought that was interesting. I had never really seen anything with him in it before. I went home and watched it, and I was completely impressed. He is completely believable in this role. I think everyone is. Frank Sinatra is amazing. He has a voice like no one else. I have to say this was a great purchase. I have watched it twice in the three days that I have had it so far. I would recommend it to anyone who likes musicals or likes any of the actors. And on a side note...Is there anyone that can say that Marlon Brando was not one of the most attractive men ever? After this movie, I am hooked! I have to go and see every movie he made in the fifties now.
