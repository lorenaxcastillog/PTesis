 Leonard Cohen's music brings together poetry, melody, sensuality and spirit in a way that hasn't been matched by any other performer i know. This movie alludes to the magic of Cohen's work but cannot fully capture it as it focuses most of its time on performers who, while trying hard, fall short of what was asked of them. As a previous reviewer quipped, I'd much prefer to see more of the man and less of the fans. I found myself fidgeting whenever the camera focused on others. Especially the Wainwrights seemed to be all over the place, undeservedly so, IMHO; and Nick Cave was vaguely dissapointing with his Sinatra mannerisms. I liked the piece by Anthony (who I haven't heard of before) and especially the closing performance by Bono and his buddies together with Cohen; it was touching to see the respect these guys have for the old aristocrat. I have a lot of affection for Cohen and was sincerely touched by this movie. The humility, the nobility of character and mind and the sheer power of presence that emanate from Leonard show how a well-spent life looks like.
