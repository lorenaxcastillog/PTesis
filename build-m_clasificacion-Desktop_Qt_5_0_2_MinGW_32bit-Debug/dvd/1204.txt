 I just received my DVD this week and I absolutely love it! I've done the classic abs segment and the core segment and they are both great. I watched the other two segments and the exercises seem a bit more advanced as far as core strength and balance but the exercises themselves aren't impossible to do like some abs videos I've attempted. I love Tracey York and I was excited about the cardio segment. She gives you a really good workout but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with ankle or knee problems. The 12-minute all over fix is GREAT. I wasn't sure a 12-minute workout would be worth my time, but she has some great moves that really work. I would definately recommend this DVD for anyone looking for a great abs and/or cardio workout. The 12-minute workout is also great, but I'd recommend the Shape Your Hips, Butt and Thighs workout if you're wanting a really good lower body workout
