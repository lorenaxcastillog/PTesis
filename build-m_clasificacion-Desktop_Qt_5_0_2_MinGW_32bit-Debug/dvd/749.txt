 This movie is really fun because they mixed everything all around and made it confusing. Pay attention the other person is right. This movie is for people who like art movies. It is violent. Some people cannot follow it, but those who do love it. I really loved it. It is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off, but it is really great. This is one you have to think with and pay attention to. This is not something to walk in and out of. It would not make any sense at all. Not one for kids. They will be really confused. It will take so long to explain it to them and still you may not be able to. A smart teen could probably understand it, but some adults cannot. If you are reading reviews I am sure you can. It is some great mental exercise and so much better than other movies when you want something of more substance
