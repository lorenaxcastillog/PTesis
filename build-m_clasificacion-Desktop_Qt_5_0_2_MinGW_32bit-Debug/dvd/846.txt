 This show undoubtly is one of the greatest around. I have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give American's their own Monty Python show and they failed because their show is BETTER than Monty Python. Their show is not BETTER, it is of equal and noteworthy standing. Monty Python is history that will never been changed. They have gone on to do many other creative things. Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development. I can honestly say that this show is not better, yet it is close, to Monty Pythons Flying Circus. Both are great shows. It is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you haven't yet, go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you won't regret adding this
