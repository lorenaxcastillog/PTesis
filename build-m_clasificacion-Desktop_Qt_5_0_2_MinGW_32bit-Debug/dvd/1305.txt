 All in all, I have to say that I enjoy this movie very much. I first saw it when I was very young (right after it came out) and it got to me just as much then as it does now. I will admit however that to a person who isn't into the UFO phenomena it might not make a lot of sense. Being very big into the paranormal myself (practically my whole life), I will say that it even took me a while to fully understand what was going on in this movie. Ultimately however at the end there isn't much that can or can't be proven as no one can really claim to know the full truth (at least that I know of :)). Altogether I give this a 4 out of 5 stars. If you're into the UFO phenomenon, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're not, it's still a fun movie to sit down to on a friday night with some popcorn and have a few thrills
