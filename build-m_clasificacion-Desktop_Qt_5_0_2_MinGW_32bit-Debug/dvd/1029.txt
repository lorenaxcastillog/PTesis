 What an awesome movie!!! Filmed in the early 70's, before seatbelt laws and just before the big gas crunch. The stars of this film may not have been the greatest actors (the dialog is a little sloppy) but they more than make up for it with the action. While watching this film you step back in time. Mini skirts, wide lapels on the coats, wide ties, bell bottoms, big hairdos (even on the men) and everyone was smoking something. Cars, cars, and more cars. The big 3 Chrysler, Ford and GM are all well represented in this film, plus imports from VW to Rolls Royce. There is even a chase scene with a Ford tow truck pulling a "Charger" while being chased by a police K-9 unit (of course the tow truck gets away). The final chase scene (which I could never describe adequately) is worth any amount a money you would pay for this movie. If you love to watch that 70's show, old reruns of Adam 12 or Dragnet and you love cars that were built when they still used contact points in the distributer, you must see this film.
