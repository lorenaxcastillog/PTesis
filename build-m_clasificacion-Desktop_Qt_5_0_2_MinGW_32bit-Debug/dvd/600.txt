 I cannot say more than what the other 5 star raters have said. This is perhaps the BEST haunted house movie ever made. Black and white, no blood, no ghosts, no murders, no nekkid chicks, no revolving walls or dungeons. Trust me. The director will play with your mind in this one. Much of it centers around Eleanor, one of the "ghost hunters" who apparently has a bit of a skeleton in her closet, maybe she's a bit off, as we learn that her mother never wanted her leaving or even driving. Yet the haunting of Hill House couldn't be just in HER head, as the others deal with everything from screaming, cold spots, voices, bangings, and a horrifying breathing door. Gargoyles, carvings, statues, and even shapes in the wallpaper make you wonder if you are seeing something there...or not. I've seen this movie countless times since it the 70s, and I still can't watch it before bedtime!
