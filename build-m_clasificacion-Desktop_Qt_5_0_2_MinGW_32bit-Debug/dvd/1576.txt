 Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination. Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead? I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers. But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal. And the film design! Bleh! Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake. The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated. I felt so much dumber after watching this movie. I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book. Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites. I don't know why I thought of that book just now. I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much
