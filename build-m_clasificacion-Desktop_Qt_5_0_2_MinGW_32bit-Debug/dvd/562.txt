 The West Wing/7th Season is a must buy! The series, which owes its genesis to the movie, The American President, is probably the best and most detailed study of the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ever created for popular culture. The seventh and final season brought back the sharp feistiness of the Sorkin/Schlamme days. Nearly all the main character stories were resolved; however, the Charlie/Zoe storyline was left hanging. This series was definitely not worthy of such a cowardly decision. (While it could be debated that Charlie was not a main character, the relationship was a major storyline over several seasons and worthy of a definitive resolution.) John Spencer's death was an ironic and unexpected blow to the series. I'm glad that "Leo McGarry" was remembered in a way that was befitting both the character and the man who portrayed him. Without a doubt, the entire series is a definite keeper
