 I finally broke down and bought this after periodically borrowing my moms copy. I find myself regularly wanting to go back and look at it. If you like survival movies, this is one of the best I have ever seen. If you like great acting, cinematography, and music, here you have it. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are both magnificent as rich boss and executive going on an adventure photo expedition in Alaska. When Hopkins finds out that photographer Baldwin is having an affair with his model wife it gets frosty between them. While taking a flight together their bush plane crashes in a remote area and they must find their way back to civilization. When a huge bear attacks them and follows them relentlessly the priorities change and who is the real survivor is left open till the last few minutes. Each of their mental and physical abilities are tested to the edge. Irony abounds as the stronger younger man may not be the best suited to a hostile environment. Great movie and one I highly recommend
