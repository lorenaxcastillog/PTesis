 I first saw this film when it was released in 1963 at the theater. I remember one specific scene in which everyone in the house yelled. I mean the way the scene was set up and executed, scared the heck out of everyone. I'm talking about the scene with the steel spiral staircase that started shaking and the balcony. I don't want to say more and take the fun out of it for those who haven't yet seen it. Those that have will know what I'm talking about. After over 40 years this film still stands out in my mind, and in my opinion, nothing since has come close to duplicating the atmosphere in this movie. With Halloween around the corner this would be the perfect movie to set the mood. Yes, it is in B&W, but don't let that deter you from seeing an all time Horror classic. Charlie S
