 I can't say that I toatlly enjoyed the first Eloise made for T.V. movie by Disney but, my youngest cousin wanted to give this a go for family movie night around the holidays. I watch it and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it. Little Eloise is done wonderfully by Sophia who plays the michviously little girl who just loves Christmas at the plaza. Eloise manages to change lives close to Christmas day having old friends re-connect as lovers and rescue a friend from a doomed marriage or help a grieving mother manage to stay at her home. Not to mention getting into plenty of trouble and buying heaps of presents. Eloise all in all has the life every little girl wants to have. I found myself dreaming about being at the Plaza at Christmastime myself. My little cousin loved the movie and I enjoyed it myself. It's a perfect movie to add to your Christmas collection or just to watch with your kids. Right now, we're watching it in Febuary!!! It's a great treasure and I can only hope this isn't the last in the Eloise series
