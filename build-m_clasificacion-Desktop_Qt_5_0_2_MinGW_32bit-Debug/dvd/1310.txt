 This movie should have won an Oscar. The acting was superb. Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson were so convincing as lesbians. Their common interest of Jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians, but them (of course), is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes. The writing is amazing. The nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more. Stockard Channing was aspiring as a pyschologist. She made me feel like I could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant. The stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life. The twists and turns provided in The Three Sisters story was like a M Night Shyamalan movie. I won't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise! All in all I feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss. With dialogue like two men saying (...) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like Alice or Claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - I feel like I should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber
