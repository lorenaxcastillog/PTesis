 One of the first videos I bought on VHS was this movie, One of the first movies I bought on Laserdisc was this movie, and then I waited for the perfect time to pick this up on DVD. I bought the 20th anniversery edition of this back when it was a new release, and it is so worth it. The 25th anniversery edition has all the same as this DVD, but has a cool new digipack cover. This version here includes the 2 part "Beyond the Wall" documentary, 5.1 surround sound, and a crisp, clear picture. There are also some other goodies tossed in here as well. This is an album where roger waters and the rest of pink floyd were hitting mid stride and on all cylinders. Of course this also marked the slow downfall of waters into monotany, with albums like "The Final Cut", "Radio K.A.O.S." and "The Wall, Live in Berlin" to follow the war formula. Floyd continued to grow, even after this. This is a great capture of Floyd at there prime, but this DVD, or any copy you can. A must own.
