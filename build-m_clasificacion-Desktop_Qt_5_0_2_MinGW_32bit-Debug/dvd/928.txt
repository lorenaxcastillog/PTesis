 I picked this up from Hollywood video, noticing "SUNDANCE" across the cover. It is a very interesting movie. I may not have seen all of the director's other work, as many of the other reviewers, but having picked this off the shelf by chance, I think I am as qualified as any to say that "Melvin Goes to Dinner" is an excellent film. It is a thoroughly entertaining, interesting and thought-provoking film about people. Four people end up chatting for hours over wine at a bistro. The viewer does not know their particular relationships to one another, and in the beginning of the movie, little flashes from the characters' lives are thrown in. I thought the beginning was a bit too much information for a viewer, but it sorted out in the end as the characters' lives unfolded to each other and the viewer. It was an excellent movie, I highly recommend it
