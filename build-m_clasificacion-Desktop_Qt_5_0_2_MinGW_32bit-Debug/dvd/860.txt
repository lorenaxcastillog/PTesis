 it's interesting to see the beatles within the context of their contemporaries in the entertainment world of 1964. i wasn't born at the time so it is something of a revelation to me. some of the other acts on the show are embarrassingly bad, but this was the state of the still infantile tv of the time. the beatles ushered in a period of unbridled creativity that was only hinted at during this period. the video quality is poor much of the time when compared to the same clips as presented in the beatles anthology series. ed himself seems to have all the charisma and savy of a stuffed hippo, but he certainly managed to pull in some of the finest musical acts of the sixties over the course of his run. he was mtv, vh1, and soul train all rolled into one. ed gave america the beatles and we shouldn't forget him for that
