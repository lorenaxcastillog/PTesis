 The movie is awsome! If you have sons watch it with them and point out the love the brothers show for one another as one brother begins to die. The brothers were ready to kill each other throughout the movie after several events had left them lifeless, sad, and demonic for they had watched thier entire family die. Lost in thier own grief they did not realize the need they had for one another until it was too late. At the end of the movie you see the bad brother smile for the first time in the movie. He smiles after recieving a mortal wound when he hears his brother cry out his name, in fear knowing he is watching his brother die. He smiles and remembers his brother as a small child calling his name as a child calls out for his mother a million times a day. He smiles and says, "How sweet...I had forgoten." Reviewing the entire movie: Awsome soundtrack and very fast moving. You have to see it more than once to catch it all. You have to play it after that just to keep the sound track going for you never tire of it
