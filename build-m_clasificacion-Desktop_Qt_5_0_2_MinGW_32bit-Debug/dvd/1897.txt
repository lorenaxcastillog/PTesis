 Okay, most people realize that 35mm film stock from the 1970s was really rotten, much of it is already fading. So it stands to reason that most movies shot in the 1970s will not fare as well on HD-DVD as newly filmed movies. Animal House is no exception. Universal has done about as well as could be expected with this classic. It has more detail than the standard edition in my side by side comparison. Dean Wormer's face is almost too clear! There is not much difference in the sound. All of the extras from the previous special edition are here AND you even get the movie in standard DVD on the reverse of the HD side. All in all this is a wonderful presentation. If you come to view this HD-DVD, just remember that the 1970s were NOT the golden years for 35mm film stock. Just be glad that this HD-DVD looks as good as it does
