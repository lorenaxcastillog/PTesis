 Years ago, in the days before cable, there were six or seven television stations in Chicago. Only a few of them had programming late at night. There weren't channels to flip between; when you found a movie you liked, you actually watched it. One weekend night, I came home late and found my sister watching the late-late show on WGN. "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it. A good Sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park. And this movie is as wild a ride as any Sturges movie. I have seen this movie a number of times over the last 30 years and each time I am almost doubling over with laughter. I can't wait to get it on DVD. For a few years in the 1940s Preston Sturges was a brilliant shinning star. As far as I am concerned, he never shone brighter than he did in this "Miracle."
