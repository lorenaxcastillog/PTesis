 This is a classic Hollywood musical that should be in everyone's dvd library. The dvd transfer is crisp and clean. And the film itself is just charming. I remember seeing this film many years ago at a revival theater. When Rita unexpectantly walked onto the screen there was an audible gasp from the audience! There were more gasps during those incomparable Astaire-Hayworth dance numbers!! The "I'm Old Fashioned" and "The Shorty George" dances are among the best EVER filmed. Certainly Rita was among Fred's best partners, if not THE BEST...together they fly through their dance numbers flawlessly...their tap routines in BOTH films they did together are the most complicated I've ever seen, yet they are excecuted with such grace, ease, and absolute joy!!! It's quite clear that Astaire & Hayworth liked each other very much. The music by Jerome Kern and lyrics Johnny Mercer are sweet and lilting and beautifully underscore the modern day, yet tender fairy-tale romance between Astaire and Hayworth perfectly. This dvd brought that all back to me again.....Three words for this film-SMOOTH-BEAUTIFUL-CHARMING!
