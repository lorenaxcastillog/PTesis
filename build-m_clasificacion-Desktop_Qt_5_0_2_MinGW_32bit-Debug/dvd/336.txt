 From Hell: I don't think I can give a very good review of this movie because it is based on actual events, and the case was never solved, and I'm not familiar with the facts that do exist about it. All I can say is that given what I know, which is extremely limited, I think this is a good portrayal of what may have been. Of course, I think Johnny Depp was awesome in his role of the inspector in charge of the case. But then again, I love him; so... I'm not normally a fan of movies that take us back so far in time, but this one didn't bother me. I guess that is probably because of the subject matter. It's one of those instances where plot overrules setting/time period. That doesn't happen very often for me, so I'm impressed with that alone. So I guess for me, that about sums up my review. I'm sure it's not very helpful, unless you can use the information about Johnny Depp, and the info about historical films. If so, I'm glad I could be of service!
