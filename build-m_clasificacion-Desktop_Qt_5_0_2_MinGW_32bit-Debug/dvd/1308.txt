 Sumptuous film version of David Hare's play about a young and idealistic Englishwoman who experiences her glory-days whilst working for the Resistance in WW2, only to find disillusionment and unhappiness in the following years. Meryl Streep turns in a credible performance in the very difficult role of Susan Traherne. Susan survives the danger-fraught days of the Resistance full of hope and ambition, that is soon crushed when she returns to a sense of numbing apathy in England. Marriage to renowned foreign service officer Raymond Brock (Charles Dance) does little to improve her outlook; initially entranced by her unorthodox ways, he becomes repulsed by her and sees her as an embarrassment. Susan eventually becomes a piece of driftwood floating through her own life, and that is the real tragedy. Hare's stinging social commentary, based around an entire lost generation of real-life "Susan's", still packs quite a wallop. Meryl Streep is fabulous as Susan with a fine support-cast including Tracey Ullman, Sir John Gielgud, Sting, Sir Ian McKellen and Sam Neill
