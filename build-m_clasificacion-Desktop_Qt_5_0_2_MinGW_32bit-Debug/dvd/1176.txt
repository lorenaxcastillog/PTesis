 This was when PBS and the CTW were making programs that were both "educational" and entertaining in all sense of the words. Today, while PBS still does Children's Television, the programs are not quite as effective as the earlier shows were. Seseme Street is still on, but replacement shows like those shows that are made by Scholastic Company, just do not have the same effective ability to get kids to learn, while shows like Seseme Street, The Electric Company, and Mr Rogers's Neighborhood did. Anyway Volume 2 of the Best of the Electric Company is being prepared for a DVD release, Like Volume One, it will also feature a selection of shows from the six seasons that it aired on PBS. I understand Rita Moreno will host new episode Introductions to each episode. A few more of the cast and crew will be interviewed in their work on the show (if only they could get Bill Cosby and Morgan Freeman to do interviews), and yes, more of the shows will feature Spider-Man segments
