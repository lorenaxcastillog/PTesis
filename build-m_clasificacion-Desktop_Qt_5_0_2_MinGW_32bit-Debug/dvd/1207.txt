 In contrast to a lot of American productions on art/artists, this stands out for being tasteful, informational, and interesting. For relying on the strength of the actual photographs, instead of irritating editing or distractions related to the process or a heavy biography on the creator's personal life. It's also willing to rely on the artist's narration of their own work, so you'll get to hear them explain their thoughts in-depth and you'll view their work entirely differently than if you'd just seen it in a book or a gallery. The first few minutes will be boring if you make quick judgements about their work, soon after though, you'll see the depth of their interests and the way their mind operates. Plenty of reason to pay attention! You'll be turned out to a lot of new photographers, this is way better than any modern photography book you can get your hands on
