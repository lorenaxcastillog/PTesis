 This has been arguably the most enjoyable import i have got this year. Over here in Australia we have just barely started seeing the 2nd series of NewlyWeds on free-to-air tv here, so naturally i snapped up this 'smile time' variey hour excitedly. But what shocked me was that it was really funny. A prime example was when Nick decided to introduce his favourite Baseball playing friend. 'Oh Dear' I thought aloud. But luckily it turned to a classic case of audience abuse, and everyone can enjoy that. Jessica working at an 'ole style Saloon with the power to read dirty thoughts which results in Nick all wet... 10 Seconds Of Awkwardness with Mr T was another example of irreverence that i enjoyed.... But what topped it off was the music. The songs were delightful. Oh, and Jess Pole Vaulting... So if you havent seen it, or heard of it (Australian people) buy it now and laugh
