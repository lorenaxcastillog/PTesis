 After dismantling the mammoth stage productions of ZooTV and Popmart in the nineties, U2 returned with the old fashioned approach to the live concert setting.Stripping away all the excess lighting and props(remember the lemon?)and not doing what other veteran bands have gotten into the habit of doing,like filling the stage with background singers and musicians.U2 did not want to to have any distractions on stage and therefore did away with it all leaving just them and their audience and very minor backing tracks.The band look and sound excellent,joking with the audience and having an all around good time,Bono even invites his young daughter onstage with him while they play"Mysterious Ways","Until the end of the World"the song about Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Christ comes to life and out does the studio version by far.This is U2's best concert dvd to date,every music lover should have this disc in your collection.You won't regret it...Enjoy!This is probably one of the greatest concert's captured on video
