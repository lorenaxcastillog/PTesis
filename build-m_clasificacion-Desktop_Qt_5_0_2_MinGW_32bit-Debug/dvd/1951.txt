 I liked the DVD set to be honest. It however did remind me of the History of the Undertaker 3 disc set. The whole thing comes off as a way for WWE to make a buck(which that is the whole point in selling merchandise in the first place) than something special. JR hosts and introduces the matches but he seems so stiff doing it. On the other hand, I enjoyed the match selection, especially on disk 2 & 3. Some of tehse matches I had already seen or didn't care that much to watch anyway, but I was glad to see them. I would say this is a great set for new WWE fans. Atleast discs 2 & 3 are. Soem may get bored wi th the matches from the 70's and 80's. In the end, I could only get one dvd at teh moment, and I am glad I picked this one
