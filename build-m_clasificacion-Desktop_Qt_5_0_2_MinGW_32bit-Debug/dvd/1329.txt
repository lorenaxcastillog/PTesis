 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a classic Frank Capra film from '39. Starring a stellar cast of some of Hollywood's best from the "Golden Age" of cinema it's not only one of the greatest films of that era, but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of America was something to be proud of, not mocked. Yes it's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions, however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us. Can the young and naive Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) survive in the United States capital as a newly appointed Senator? Will he check his ideals and values at the door and play the political game or will he stand up for what's right against the "powers that be?" If you're any kind of movie buff you already know the answer. One of Capra's and Stewart's best and definitely one of the Essentials to any DVD collection!
