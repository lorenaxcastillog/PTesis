 This movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise, but it took a few watches for me to get to feel that way. Gene Hackman plays a private eye who is under utilized in his career (he plays an ex-Oakland Raider in the movie) and is also in the middle of discovering that his marriage is falling apart. (I thought it was interesting how Hackman used his private eye skills to spy on his wife while she was cheating on him.) Hackman's character accepts a seemingly open and shut runaway case (to bring home Melanie Griffith's character) that is nowhere near as simple as it seems. The plot line takes so many twists and turns it does get confusing, but it never gets boring. Overall, I thought Gene Hackman did a great job in this movie, and there were also good performances from the supporting cast. It was fun to see Melanie Griffith and James Woods so early in their careers too. The DVD was worth buying and also has footage on the making of the film
