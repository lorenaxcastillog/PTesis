 It was so refreshing to see a masterpiece of storytelling transferred to a brilliant film. The special features with directors et al was very enlightening into the integrity and balance of the film. I never thought about the great acting I kept thinking of them as real people and felt like I was a fly on the wall of this incredible and terrible series of events in the life of Serpico.I think that is the key - if your not reminded of their acting ability because you are so involved in the story it has to be great.Pacino was totally believable and authentic in this role and I personally find this my favourite role for him. So to wrap up the waffling all I can really say is regardless of the fact this film is 30yrs old (approx), it stands with precious few as remaining a brilliant and topically relevant film. Bloody fabulous
