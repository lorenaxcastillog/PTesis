 Fans of actor / musician Eric Balfour, who has played in a number of character roles, most famously as Claire Fischer's troubled boyfriend in the landmark HBO series "Six Feet Under", will love this film because you get to see this sexy hottie in all of his god-given finery! (WOOF!!) I mean, the plot is kind of paper thin and all but who cares!! I would've bought it for the realistic sex scenes alone! Which I'm not sure if they were acting in them because... well, buy it and you'll see for yourself! Eric shows everything!...frontal, rear and even an erection in at least 8 diferent scenes. This dude is FINE!! The acting does get better towards the end when Eric's character's father dies and he and the female lead's sexual relationship begins to disintergrate into something unexpected. Overall though, I liked this movie and didn't feel short-changed at all
