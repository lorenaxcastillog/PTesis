 Like a few others in Altman's career, a truly great film operating on a stealth level. A Southern California Theater of the Absurd all moving toward the sacrifice. That image of Matthew Modine holding that balloon and making that sound will stay in my memory the rest of my life. Not a movie for the impatient. Altman adept and even and driving it home--a director who's mastered his craft and can, every once in a while, create a true gem. There's a reason why everyone in Hollywood wants to be in one of his films when it looks like he's latched onto something good. They know they'll have a place in the film-greats history books. This may be his best. I watched it in three installments, so the length wasn't exhausting. Maybe that helps with the digestion too. Wonderfully absurd in a low key. Highly recommended for the discriminating viewer
