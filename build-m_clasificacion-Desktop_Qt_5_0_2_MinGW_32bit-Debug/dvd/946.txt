 Bizarre behavior in a police department? and we always thought Cops didn't have a sense of humor ... This show is, from beginning to end, packed with excellent writing and even better ad-libbing. Non-stop nonsense! The cast blew me away--all virtal unknowns before this show, and yet so talented! It takes a natural brilliance to play "dumb" so well. Some of the can't-miss recurring issues in Season 2 include: ~ Trudy falling in love with a serial killer ~ A gay prisoner/leader of the gang the "Grape Slushies" ~ Dangle's wife (gasp! it's true) ~ Some amazing PSAs by R. Williams ~ Hospital visits that make you feel sorry for everyone involved ~ Hilarious segments from traffic school ~ The entire gang finally must pay the price for their actions Perks to owning the DVD set: ~ excellent deleted scenes ~ a special segment from the 2004 Comedy Arts festival (whole cast onstage) ~ no bleeps--you get to hear what they really say ~ Come on, you'll have Reno 911 anytime of day
