 And I did, until I cried. David Cross has to be one of the bravest, funniest and-believe it or not-most eloquent comics performing today. I thought it was very original to do this kind of DVD, instead of just rehashing everything that was on 'Shut up You F*cking Baby'. Instead we get to see what it's like to be on tour with David, and get a glimpse of some of the colourful people that he gets to meet on a daily basis. The fans of Mr. Show should be pleased to know that Bob Odenkirk even makes an appearance, and says one of the funniest 'heckles' I've ever heard in my life. I honestly don't get some of the reviews for this DVD, especially since most of them are coming from David Cross/Mr. Show fans. If you see a review that contains the words "I had experienced David Cross through his part in Scary Movie 2", do yourself a favour and take that one with a grain of salt. My only complaint with the DVD is that David has yet to do a Canadian tour, so that we too can get in on the fun.
