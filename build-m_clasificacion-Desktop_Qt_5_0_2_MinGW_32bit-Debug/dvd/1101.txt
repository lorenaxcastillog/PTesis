 This is by far the best instructional dvd I have ever bought or seen, best value for my money, I'm not saying it's cheap, but it has enough information to fill 4 dvd's (which is regretfully what every one else in this industry is doing). It deals with the complete Yang style taijiquan form and chigong, thoroughly (novice to advanced), but then it is so much more. It is great on its own but it is even better with the book by same title (see my review). You can start by watching Dr Yang's lecture which in itself is a great bonus, but essentially the dvd takes you from stretching and qigong excercizes to a detailed breakdown of the complete Yang style taijiquan form. Additionally you'll be able to observe master Yang perform the form at various speeds (there's even an introduction to Fa Jing). There's even more but I don't want to spoil it all for you. Like I said before, this is no substitute to real lessons but instead is the best tool you can find to help you improve faster and with solid reliable background(basic to essential) information
