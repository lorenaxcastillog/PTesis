 Funny as can be! Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin crack me up!! This movie probably never made big money at the box office, or won any awards, but I absolutely love it! Not going to give away the plot, don't want to ruin it for you! You just have to see it! A case of mistaken identities gone amuck! Midler and Tomlin, all four of them, are a hoot! Laughed myself silly! Bette milking a cow... Lilly on the elevator with the dog... eating sushi.. their friend from home.. then, meeting at the hotel, in the ladies room... Oh wow, it was funny! My dear husband, Norman, even laughed at all the right parts. He seldom stays awake late at night, but he watched this with me, and my little eight year old granddaughter in bed with us, sweet thing, she fell asleep - shhhhh! adorable. Aren't grand kids a miracle? You won't be sorry if you buy, rent, or steal this DVD, watch it!
