 This is my favorite dance/exercise dvd!! The dvd shows the short tahitian routine that you will learn in the dvd. Then you have a small warmup. From there, Kili breaks down movements and steps and incorporates exercise elements like a grapevine, squats or a fitness hop. During this time you are actually doing hula moves and getting a very good workout (esp for the legs). I'm a beginner and was able to pick up the moves fairly quickly, though I am still reluctant to incorportate my the arm movements. After the 25 min workout, kili demonstrates the dance routine again with vocal cues, then demonstrates the dance twice more without the vocal cues. Then you there is a cooldown and stretching session. In this video you will learn to roll your hips, do the figure eight, the tahitian bump, and the pookie, or hip raises. It's really great fun!! I have ordered other Island Girl dvds!!
