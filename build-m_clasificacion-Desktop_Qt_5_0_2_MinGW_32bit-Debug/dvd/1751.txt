 The content of this dvd is similar to the Chomsky book of the same name as well as 9/11, but for those that learn more by listening than by reading, this dvd is a great choice. Chomsky helps to put the tragic events of 9/11 in the proper context. It may not please some people to be reminded that the U.S. has propped up plenty of dictators and overthrown plenty of democracies, but there's no disputing what Chomsky brings up in his work, it's all factually accurate. It's just a matter of your worldview and whether or not you think the U.S. should be able to do whatever it wants, and then hold others to standards that we would never apply to ourselves. Chomsky has been a steady and reliable source for learning about the world we live in for decades now. He doesn't play petty partisan politics. You won't see him give a pass to anyone...Republican or Democrat. In order to really trust a critic of U.S. foreign policy, this type of balance is an elementary prerequisite. There is no better place to find this balance than Chomsky
