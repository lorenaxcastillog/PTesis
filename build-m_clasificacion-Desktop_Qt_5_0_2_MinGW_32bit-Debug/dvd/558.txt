 It is nice to find a movie that believes that its viewers have an IQ over 60. Hollywood doesn't make enough of these types of movies. The movie itself is quite thrilling. The last half an hour actually has you sitting on the edge of your seat. I found it to be quite entertaining and well worth checking out. The acting wasn't the best, but I've most definately seen worst. It was refreshing for the director to choose several "no name" actors so that we can enjoy the progress of the story and not be distracted by celebrities. It added a lot of realism to the movie. The best part about the DVD was the makeing-of feature. It is amazing how much was done with the lack of technology that Hollywood has now. It was even interesing how they had killed their monkey. If you enjoy the movie I highly suggest you check out the feature as well. It is only half an hour long but I had wished it could have been longer and more detailed
