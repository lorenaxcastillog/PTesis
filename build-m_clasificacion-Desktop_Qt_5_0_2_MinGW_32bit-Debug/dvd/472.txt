 I don't want to offend anyone, but the reason this wonderful film arrives in full screen on dvd, is because it was shot that way. The very first widescreen movie was "The Robe", 1953. So any film which you buy on DVD before 1953 will be a 4:3 aspect ratio. We as movie going fanatics back then didn't know any better. "The Robe" was produced in widescreen as a way of drawing people back into movie houses, since theater goers were staying home to watch old movies on 4:3 televisons. So, if you're upset about the aspect ratio of this DVD, feel better about it. There never was a widescreen version of this movie. Enjoy it for lush sets and wonderful performances, all directed by a man who knew exactly how to use every single inch of a 4:3 screen, John Huston. He made some of the greatest movies ever produced in that aspect ratio, and this is one of them.
