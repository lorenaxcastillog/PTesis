 I just returned from seeing this movie at the theatre and was so impressed I wanted to find out more. Unfortunately I see there is no soundtrack available, but I'm hoping that will change, because the music used in the movie was one of the most touching and memorable aspects. Yet, WORDS are the true star of this film, and it was heartwarming to get an inside glimpse at an intellectual hobby that crosses (pun intended) all groups regardless of age, economic status, etc. Not only did I walk away inspired to become an avid New York Times Crossword Puzzler, but uplifted by the positive comradery of the puzzling community. In a world where it seems so easy to find things that divide us, it was wonderfully surprising and satisfying to see this warm film about something uniquely universal. The creators non-judgemental treatment of the pastime and those devoted to it is worth at least 4 stars whether or not you like to engage in wordplay.
