 I'm sure that this anime show is topnotch. I'm sure it kicks ass. However, why in god's name are they selling it for almost $150? Because you are willing to pay for it. Do the sell Harvey Birdman or Venture Bros for this much? No, because nobody is stupid enough to pay for it. While it is a good show, I would reccomend refraining from buying it until they cut the price down (simmilar to Neon Genesis, cowoby Bebop, Trigun, and every other 7 year old, 24 episode anime they want to sell to you for $100). With all due respects, the Simpsons is also animated abroad. Their boxsets contain just as many episodes as these animes. Yet they can sell their stuff for $70 cheaper. Save your money and just tape, dvd tape, or tivo this stuff if you want it so much. Most of these anime series are lacking in extras, or the extras are in Japanese.
