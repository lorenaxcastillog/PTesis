 This was the best movie that the beatles did it was funny and had a bit more of a plot this time. 'in the weeks that followed five more attemts were made to steal the ring.' Quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he,he. But in 'another girl' we can only wish that Paul would wear that tshirt more often. and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music. That is before John turned into mountain man\amish terrorist anyway. Okay! Now I'll actullay reveiw the movie. Help! was a clever movie, and had a plot! Imagine that! Anyway, the movie was about Ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring. that wont come off. Sooo, Ringo must be sacrificed. So high preist Clang, and Aimee end up trying to sacrifice him. Or Clang is anyway. Aimee's trying to protect him. Prof. Foot and his assistant Algenon are after the ring too. so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere. The bahamas, the alps you know. Well i'm not gonna give away the ending so you'll just have to buy the movie and find out. So do it! it's worth it!
