 There's so many reasons I didn't like this and am rabidly searching for someone, ANYONE to rid me of it before I just pitch it in the trash can. *It's not dance. It's regular fluffy girl aerobics pretending to be dance. Boring. *The "instructor" has the personality of a limp dishrag and honestly, if I heard her say "I wanna see your personality in this girls!" one more time... I woulda broke my TV. *It's way too difficult to follow unless you are an aerobics maven. I'm only slightly over weight compared to some of my friends (147 lbs at 5 ft 4 in) and I could barely get into some of the steps before Ms. Galardi was spritely bouncing into something else. So it's going to send you back to the couch with some Doritos if you're like most of us out there that would need such a DVD. I wish I had ignored the professional or spotlight reviews and just read the customer ones. This DVD is AWFUL!
