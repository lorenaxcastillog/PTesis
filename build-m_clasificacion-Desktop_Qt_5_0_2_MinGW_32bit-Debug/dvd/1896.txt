 Stewart Granger plays celebrated white hunter and guide Allen Quatermain in the turn of the century African adventure yarn "King Solomon's Mines". The technicolor film is highlighted by the outstanding cinematography of Oscar winner Robert Surtees featuring a wide array of animals in their native habitat. Granger is reluctantly hired by proper Englishwoman Elizabeth Curtis played by Deborah Kerr to locate her husband who disappeared in the unexplored African interior while attempting to find the legendary diamond mines. An exorbitant sum of money finally convinces Granger to embark on this dangerous trek. Accompanied by Kerr's brother in law John Goode played by Richard Carlson, the trio along with a group of native bearers make their way inland using an antiquated map. Overcoming many hardships and encountering many groups of both friendly and unfriendly natives they inexorably make their way towards their destination. As expected, sexual tension between Granger and Kerr provide for some amusing dialogue and interplay. Without Surtees excellent work the plot, standing on it's own would be rather mediocre. The ending of the movie was sudden and anti climatic, depressing the overall quality of the film
