 I posted this originally under "wow...this sucks"...I may have been a little harsh. I am still disappointed with it, as I had high hopes when I caught the tail end of the performance on TV (but I think I saw his first "Bananas"). Its not that there are no funny parts (there are a few), but its that his material is not really fresh and original...its been done before and done better(particularly arguing with his puppets and some of his general observations that start the show and I really didn't care for his timing/delivery). I will say that his puppet symphony at the end is a killer segment...I did laugh really hard at that...i guess if i could change my rating it would be a 2 out of 5 instead of 1. Check out the Jeff Allen "Bananas" DVD...he is funny, orginal, and the story of his life will bless anyone who watches it.
