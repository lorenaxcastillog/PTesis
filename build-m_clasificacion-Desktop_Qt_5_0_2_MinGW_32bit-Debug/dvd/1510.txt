 I'm willing to bet for many people(myself included) that this isn't the kind of film anyone will walk away from thinking "Phenomenal". No matter how many times you see this movie it will never reach phenomenal status, but it does get better every time you watch. The first time I saw this movie I hated the annoyingly stupid characters and poorly delivered jokes. Then while laying in bed I start thinking about some of the corny jokes like "Im trapped under the ice" and "Trix Rabbit or Count Chocola". So I pop in the DVD again and every time I watch is better then the last, because you find more silly/corny one liners that stick in your head. Directing=4 stars Ending=2.5 stars acting&cast=4 stars replay value=4 stars music=4.5 stars OVERALL= 3.8 STARS If you like corny humor like "Kung Pow, enter the fist", you might like this movie. If your looking for the same dark teen humor found in "Jawbreaker", this is not your film.
