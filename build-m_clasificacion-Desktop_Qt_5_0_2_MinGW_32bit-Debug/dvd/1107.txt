 A perfect sequel to the original "Candyman", the second - and best - of the series involves the Candyman's modern-day descendants and also delves much further - and more graphically - into the origins of the character. The special effects are ghastily realistic, the production design and production values flawless, vivid characterization, and the acting again award-caliber, with special mention going to Kelly Rowan and Timothy Carhight as the main 'protagonist' couple, the little girl who brilliantly plays their lovable young daughter (sorry, I can't remember her name), and of course the always excellent Tony Todd, who turns in great performances even in weak movies and absolutely shines in something like this. "Farewell To The Flesh" also features some of the most memorable visual imagery around, including the unsettlingly surreal sight of the Candyman in the middle of a vast Mardi Gras celebration, slowly stalking down center street amongst the costumed festivities unnoticed (or possibly Unseen?) Masterful, probably among the top 5 Clive Barker-related movies ever made, which I feel just about says it all
