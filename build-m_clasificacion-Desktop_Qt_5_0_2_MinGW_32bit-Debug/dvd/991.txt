 I last saw this production in 1981. I was stationed at the American Embassy in New Delhi at the time. Someone had it on a VHS tape, second or third generation ... it was a horrible copy. BUT: it was ABBA! This DVD release is SO much better ... WIDESCREEN ... DTS sound ... CLEAR! It immediately brought me back to that time period. ABBA had their fingers on the pulse of a time period that still pulsated with the Beatles' music, James Bond, the upheavals of Vietnam, the Munich Massacre, the Russians in Afghanistan, Nixon's resignation, etc. Their music, in contrast to many events of the time, was cheerful/upbeat. The girls in the group were positively lovely, the outfits the band wore were great, and the MUSIC was absolutely outstanding. This DVD covers it all. Forget the inane supposed "story," sit back, and be fully entertained by one of the world's premier musical groups. ABBA: like the song that ends the movie - THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC
