 "How to Succeed" is an energetic and snappy satire of big business. As the story opens, J. Pierpont Finch (Robert Morse) is a poor but ambitious window washer; he finds a "how-to" book that can teach him to climb the corporate ladder in no time at all. Ponty follows the book's advice and advances from the mailroom of the World Wide Wicket Company to become its president, falling in love with secretary Rosemary (Michele Lee) along the way. The movie looks like a staged play, and that's a good thing, since this was such a smash hit on Broadway. It preserves forever the look of the early sixties with vibrant colors, pillbox hats, and references to Metrecal and Wildroot Cream-Oil. The unique Robert Morse is the whole show here. He originated the stage role of Ponty and this movie made him an even bigger star. He is a great singer and dancer, but it's his irresistible personality and charisma that keep you rooting for him. Michele Lee is perfect as his leading lady, and Rudy Vallee reprises his stage role as the singing, dancing, and knitting Big Boss. This is a happy, fun movie. Kon
