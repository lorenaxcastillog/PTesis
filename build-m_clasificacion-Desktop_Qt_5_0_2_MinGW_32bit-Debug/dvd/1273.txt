 I bought this DVD after taking a pilates class with the pilates machines, so I was familiar with some of the mat moves throughout the five 10-minute sections. My pilates teacher told me that if I purchase ANY pilates DVD to supplement the pilates/machines class, the best way to do it is this: 1 - Review the move according to the teacher and practice it once. 2 - Pause the DVD. 3 - Do the move AT YOUR OWN PACE and AT YOUR OWN LEVEL. 4 - Do not try to keep up with the teacher. After 4-6 sessions on the DVD, you should be able to do the moves SLOWLY, but WITH STRENGTH and BETTER CONCENTRATION - AT YOUR OWN PACE, even if it takes you longer than the prescribed 10 minutes. If you try to keep up with Lara - you could end up inflaming your lower back, or straining your neck. You have to ask yourself - what's my goal? To get stronger? Or to get it over with in 10 minutes?
