 A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio. The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out. What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her... This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game. We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it. We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon. Thank you. Aussie Girls
