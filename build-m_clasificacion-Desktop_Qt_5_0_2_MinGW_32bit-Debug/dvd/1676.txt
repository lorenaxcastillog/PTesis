 Another masterpiece from Akira Kurosawa featuring Toshiro Mifune, this time Mifune is not a samurai armed with a sword but a determined executive armed with 50 million yen to make a deposit on a percentage of shares that would make him the big boss of National Shoes, where he has worked for 30 years. On the night that he is to make his takeover he receives a phone call telling him that his son has been kidnapped for a 30 million yen ransom. Without a second delay he makes arrangements to pay the kidnapper, but then he learns that the kidnapper made a mistake and took his chauffeur's son instead. What is he to do? Part moral dilemma and part police thriller HIGH AND LOW despite being 43 years old is still very powerful and exciting. Sadly though the usually dependable Criterion dropped the ball and this DVD has no extras. Not even an audio commentary by Kurosawa expert Stephen Prince. It's still worth buying just for the movie alone. Watch in the police station scenes for an appearance by sometime Kurosawa leading man Takashi Shimura (STRAY DOG, IKIRU).
