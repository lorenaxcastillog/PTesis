 As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories. The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona. This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's. Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960. The people were wonderful to grow up with. This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer. I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD. I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts. Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating
