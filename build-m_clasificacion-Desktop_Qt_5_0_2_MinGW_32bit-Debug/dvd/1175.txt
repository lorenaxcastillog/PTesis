 What struck me was how old the other actors have gotten. OMG! Anyways, each of the other actor's - Louis Avlos, Skip Hinnant, Hattie Winston, Judy Graubart and Jim Boyd introduce the episodes as well as the trivia bits in between episodes. What's even nicer is those "missing" sketches appear to be on here: ex. "The L-Y Song", "Sweet Sweet Sway", "Phantom of Love", "Grease This Town", "We are out of Sweet Rolls", "The Six Dollar & Thirty Nine Cent Man", Julie Grown Up (aka Julie The Cook), etc. It's also nice to sample a little more episodes from the 2nd season. Of course there are definately a bunch of repeat sketches/cartoons like "I would Die For A Piece of Your Pie", "Unlock Your Love, Unbutton Your Mind", "Right On", "Silent E", "Grin (w/ Louis Avlos), Skip Hinnant Blind Folded with each cast member handing him an object that starts with "GR", "Sneeze, Snore, Sniff" song, and many more. Bottom Line: We All Get Old! --- oops no I mean This is another great set!!! Better buy it if you have the first one!
