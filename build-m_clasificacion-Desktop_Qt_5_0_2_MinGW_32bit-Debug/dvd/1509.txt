 There were a couple of aspects of this movie that were a little too neat and packaged, like how Reese'es character's dad changes overnight and such. But I have to say that this movie was riveting to me. I have never before seen Patricia Arquette and I was just astounded. Her performance is absolutely superb. To me, a book or movie is great, when I literally feel like I have become a person in the story, and feel everything that person feels. That is why this movie is so great. Patricia's character is that person in this movie, at least to me. I am an absolute fan of Reese Witherspoon, so I couldn't be too objective as I love everything about her and she is great in this movie as always. Her character really shows the love of a true friend to the abused girl. I cannot imagine anyone watching this movie and not enjoying it. It is a truly heartwarming story. I will watch it again and again. If you like it, check out &quot;The Man in the Moon.&quot
