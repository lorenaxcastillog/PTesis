 I recently gave this movie another shot, at the request of a friend. I was impressed, this time, with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography. It's as if every scene could be a postcard, and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing. And the songs are great, if a little "forced" into the movie. Unfortunately, that's all there is, except beautiful Brad Rowe, totally wasted here in this nothing piece about self-indulgence and galling disregard for everyone that loves you (while pining away for what you obviously can't have.) Add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others (Sean P. Hayes' character) while simply pursuing your own desires. ("I want to be there for him.") Right. It's so artificial, it's about as convincing as plastic palm trees. There are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers, but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long, heart-felt pauses of nothing. Someone made this picture to fulfill their dream, and did a fine job of casting and cinematography. There is little else to see here. Even as a fluff piece, it's barely worth your time
