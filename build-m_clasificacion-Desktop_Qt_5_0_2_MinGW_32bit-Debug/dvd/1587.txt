 I think that Anthony Hopkins gives a terrific portrayal of Paul (not that I've ever met Paul....:) He brings a lot to the character that I have never really considered in reading the Bible. He does a great job at "humanizing" Paul. Paul was such a tremendous apostle at the start of the Christian church. I think Hopkins has given to us, in this film, a look at Paul that truly shows his human side. I tried to understand what might have been Paul's "thorn in the flesh." Maybe it was his arrogance (as he stated himself). I've always thought it was possibly some physical impairment but after seeing this movie, maybe it has more to do with pride, etc. An interesting perspective. Anyway, I highly recommend the movie. It shows some of what the Bible describes of the relationship between Peter and Paul. The film stays pretty close to what the Bible describes (certainly taking a little artistic license) in filling in some places. Even that though is done very well.
