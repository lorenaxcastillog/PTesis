 Something of a multilingual cross between "Friends" and BBC's "This Life," this film is an entertaining portrayal of several young singles sharing a crowded flat in Barcelona. The central character (played by Romain Duris) finds himself liberated from his parochial horizons as a 20-something Frenchman destined for a corporate desk job, in a restrained romantic relationship with a girl (Audrey Tautou) as maddeningly clinging as his hippie mother. His experience causes him a kind of rebirth as a European, his best friend among the lot a lesbian who teaches him how to make love to a woman - another liberating experience that has him seducing the wife of a newly married man who has befriended him. At two hours, the film has enough time to explore the personalities and relationships of most of his flat mates, and the conflicts between them that arise are quickly resolved in an overall celebration of being young, reasonably intelligent, and unburdened by any serious responsibilities. Duris, playing a naï¿½ve young man, is fun to watch as his character emerges from the cocoon of delayed adolescence; quite a contrast from his intense, driven, noirish role in the subsequent "The Beat That My Heart Skipped.
