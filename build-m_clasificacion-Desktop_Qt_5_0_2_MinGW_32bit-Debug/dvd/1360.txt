 Although The Family Guy is pretty much unknown in Holland, I've been introduced to this great show quite a while ago. After seeing quite a couple episodes of the previous seasons I came to Canada again and got the DVD from a friend. The movie was just HILARIOUS!!!! The Griffins were funny as usual and I was entertained throughout the entire movie. Lots of jokes in this show relate to North American subjects and people (makes sense since it's an American show) but this does make it quite important to know a bit of the culture and the language of course. Having subtitles on the Dutch DVD would also help of course but most of the time that still doesn't translate everything with the same humour. I read that the movie was quite similar to the last episodes of the third season but to be honest...I couldn't really care less cause I haven't seen those episodes!!!!!!!!! I guess that's the only good thing about the show not being on Dutch television.... But nothing bad about this movie and I would recommend it to everybody that has or hasn't seen it yet!!
