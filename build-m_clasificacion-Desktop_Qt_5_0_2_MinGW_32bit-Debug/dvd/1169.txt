 There are a lot of great reviews here for this new DVD release, and I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus. What a lovely film! I am familiar with the other 6 R&H movies, but I never saw this one all the way through before, and it sure never looked or sounded like this on TV. Like the song, "Chop Suey," this is a mixed plate, but the overall effect is delicious. The cast is charming, with the wonderful Oscar-winner Miyoshi Umeki repeating her Broadway triumph in the central role. The score, though not top-drawer R&H, has several gems--"A Hundred Million Miracles" and the haunting "Love, Look Away" are particularly beautiful. The real star of the film may well be Alfred Newman, whose orchestrations and arrangements make everything shimmer. And those Dong Kingman title paintings are simply gorgeous. Let's all thank Universal for (finally) doing such an outstanding job of restoring and preserving this little winner for us, and for all the future "other generations" as well. Hooray
