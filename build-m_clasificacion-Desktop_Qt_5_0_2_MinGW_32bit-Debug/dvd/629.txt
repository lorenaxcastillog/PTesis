 This movie blow me away!!!! Hard Boiled is SOOO violent that should be rated X or not for sale on the market. You see a LOT of innocent people getting killed, a baby with blood on his face, Chow Yun Fat shooting two pistols at the same time, BUNCH of explotions, slow motion stunts and shooting, lot of bloodshed, cool gun fighting and of course: Chow Yun Fat as ONE MAN ARMY!!! The only bad thing is that the movie is low budget. You won't see a nice cinematoghraphy and the sound is monaural! but the movie is still COOL!!!! The dvd is GOOD!! It contains many trailers of previous Jonh Woo movies like The Killer and A Better Tomorrow, Jonh Woo filmoghraphy, notes from Hard Boiled, guide of Hong Kong crime films, Chinesse and English languages, audio commentary and more. P.S: Some of the action scenes are very LONG, and of course: Chow Yun Fat also use different guns like shotguns and rifles. Adios
