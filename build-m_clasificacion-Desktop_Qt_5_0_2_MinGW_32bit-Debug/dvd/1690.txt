 After reading this short review, please read on. The other reviewers will tell you some info that might be useful to you. My review is short for two reasons: 1) Blade Runner is one great movie, despite the fact that this Director's Edition might not be your cup of tea. After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that. It blasts any earlier version away and that makes it worth the price. I would have rated this new DVD version five stars if the same could be said of the sound quality, but unfortunately, it only has 2 channel sound. And yes, I will buy the other versions that will come up, too. Hopefully these will play on all speakers ... ;-
