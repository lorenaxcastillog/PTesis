 I love Lucy- and have most of her movies and most of the series. This season however is not my favorite... although featuring some classic episodes such as when Lucy and Ethel wear burlap sacks by accident thinking their designer dresses or that infamous wine stomping scene. But, mainly Lucy and Ricky have lost that "spark" you saw in seasons 1-4 having notrious difficulties at the time you call that on screen as well. The gang having just returned from Hollywood in the last season- get ready for a trip around Europe together as Ricky tours Europe. Having numerous incidents and run-ins with locals from imprissonments to not being allowed to cross the border. The gang faces it all together with enormous humour. Some great episodes with a few celebrities show off Lucy's comedic talent. Still it's not one of her best seasons on the air. Be sure to buy this one Lucy fans- and newbie- Lucy fans try season 2,3,or 4- you'll fall in love with Lucy!!! No matter what I LOVE Lucy
