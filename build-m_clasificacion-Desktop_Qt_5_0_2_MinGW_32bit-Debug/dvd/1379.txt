 Although the movie is fifteen years old now, its message is potently timely. BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT revolves around what happens when terrorists nuke a Russian city and make it look like the US did the deed. Retaliations ensue and the movie becomes a frightening chase to stop further annihilation. When it appears that President Martin Landau has been killed, he is replaced by warmonger Darren McGavin who is paired up with another hawk, Rip Torn. They decide the only way to WIN the war is to take out the leaders. A subplot involves lover pilots Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay who are piloting the bomber set to do the dirty deed. The tense what if scenario is played out beautifully, with acting kudos to Landau, McGavin and Jeffrey DeMunn who plays a soldier who wants everything to stop, but is hogtied by McGavin and Torn. Along with FAIL SAFE and DR. STRANGELOVE, BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT is a hearty testimonial against nuclear weapons
