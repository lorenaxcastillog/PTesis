 This foreign (French)film had a short run on cable some thirty years ago and was later remade with an American cast and a rather lame, and Hollywood type ending. Recently I saw the American version on satellite cable and was reminded of the original. This version is not readily available and thus I was extremely pleased to have found its availability on Amazon. The story is suspenseful, scary, spooky, disconcerting, etc without the special effects or gory/blood of modern scare movies. This story should not be viewed by the faint of heart but only by thoughs who appreciate a well directed, acted, producted, cast and just plain well done story. It is one of the few old movies that is as fresh and effective today as it was over thirty years ago. It will "stay" with you and will not become a dust collector item on your video collection shelf. Highly Recommende
