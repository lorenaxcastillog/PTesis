 Like another reviewer stated here we also take this DVD to the beach with us every summer. My college age kids and I can recite the dialog right along with the actors. The cast (especially Kurt Russell) all look like they had a blast making this movie. I even remember reading in one of Jimmy Buffett's books where he quotes Captain Ron, saying something along the lines of "As Captain Ron would say '...if anything's gonna happen, it's gonna happen out there". I can't say enough about this movie, and anyone who doesn't at least chuckle a little at Captain Ron's antics probably can't find humor in anything. In fact, I noticed 4 negative reviews of the movie out of 111 (112 counting this review)which tells me that those 4 who gave it negative reviews probably aren't a whole lotta fun anyway so I don't really care what they think. Now, if they'd only come out with a sequel..
