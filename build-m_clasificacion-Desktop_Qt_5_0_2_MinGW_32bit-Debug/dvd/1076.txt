 AS I said Chase this Paper down, it is worth it if you love great films! This small film won actor/producer John Houseman his best supporting Oscar for his playing the character of Professor Kingsfield. I start off with that fact because you can see this fact while the film unfolds before you. This movie is John Houseman tout de force all the way. Kingsfield plays a teacher's teacher..he runs the students thru their paces. Timothy Bottoms plays Hart, a young law student who is dazed by all the excitement of his first year. He meets Susan ( who isa played by a very young, prew-Bionic Woman Lindsay Wagner) who Hart finds out is Kingsfield's daughter. It is an amazing character study of the first year of law school and those who teach them. Note this film also has the talents of James Naughton and Edward Herrmann in their early tv/film careers. Worth every second of film. It barely date himself, and it was released in 1973 Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL
