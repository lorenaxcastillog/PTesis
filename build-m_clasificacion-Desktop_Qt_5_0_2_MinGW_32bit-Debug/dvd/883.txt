 There is a huge oversight in the manufacturing of these discs. The discs are double sided and they failed to identify which side is Side A and which side is Side B. When they come new, Side A is facing up. But if you don't put them back in the same way, you'll need to actually put the disc into the player and pull up the episode index before you'll know whether you have the correct side or need to remove the disc and turn it over. I have looked very carefully and there is NO indication of Side A or B on any of my discs. Perhaps they corrected the problem part way through manufacturing, but I can assure you there is nothing on my discs to tell. Anyway, that is my only beef. The ER series is top notch and I think most of us are familiar with it or we wouldn't be considering buying this. I give it four stars only because of the manufacturing issue
