 This is a great response to Bronte's Jane Eyre. Here we get Edward Rochester's wife's version of the story. She portrays Rochester as a second son who travels to the Caribbean seeking a rich wife. Instead of the Byronic hero that Bronte depicts, here Rochester is a young, selfish, Englishman who disregards the needs of his wife as well as all the pledges he made to her prior to her acceptance of his marriage proposal. Typical of his class, he indulges his desires selfishly. After his brother dies unexpectantly, he inherits his family's money and position. Then contrary to all his previous promises he uproots the youthful and very innocent Antoinette (Bertha in the Bronte novel) and drags her off to his foriegn and bleak homeland. I use this movie often in my Women's Lit courses in conjunction with the 1944 version of Jane Eyre. The Wide Sargasso Sea has some rather erotic love scenes that the more conservative of my students find offensive, but I always make it available to my students with the requisite disclaimers. It is a lushly beautiful film. Its setting and cinematography alone make it worth viewing
