 This is one of the best thrillers in recent years. The story centers on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes to Italy to befriend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and persuade him to come back to the U.S. (at the wishes of Greenleaf's father). Soon, Ripley becomes immersed in Greenleaf's style and doesn't want to leave. Identity swapping, lying, and murder ensue. What's great about the movie is how you identify with Tom Ripley even as he does many evil things. The story also highlights great truths about social class, gender, and identity. The cast is exceptional--Matt Damon and Jude Law are the best. And the look of the film is wonderful. If you buy/rent the DVD, be sure to check out the commentary by director Anthony Minghella, which is like a film class. Minghella highlights how he uses performances, shots, music, editing, and backgrounds to highlight the many themes in the movie
