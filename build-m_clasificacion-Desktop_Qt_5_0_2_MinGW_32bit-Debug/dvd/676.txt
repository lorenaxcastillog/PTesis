 This is a movie that I have seen on and off through the years and have always loved. The Civil War, violence and how it affected members of different faiths and how they responded to it is a subject that I had not really considered when studying this in school. Gary Cooper is perfect as the strong father who struggles with his passion for horse racing (to church) with his friend and neighbor, and problems arise when he purchases an organ at the fair--music is not allowed by his religion! Son Anthony Perkins did well as a devoted son who feels shame at not fighting in the war and defending his home and family and has to make up his own mind how to respond when push comes to shove. This movie has everything; drama, humor and music! I still love it, no matter how many times I have seen it
