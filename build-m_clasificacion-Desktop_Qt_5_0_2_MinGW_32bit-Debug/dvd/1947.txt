 Walking Tall is a better film than I had hoped it would be. It's a fast, action packed film that is over too soon. Which is a good thing, it doesn't drag but keeps up the action. No real character or plot developement is in this film, but that doesn't keep the film from being entertaining. The Rock and Knoxville both show that they are both incredible actors when they want to be and I have to say that I was impressed with both of them as well. The movie itself was well done, although the story could have been a little deeper as stated earlier. The characters in the film are hardly introduced at all. But there is enough plot to understand what the story is about. I too have never had the chance to see the original film, but after watching this I may give it a try.
