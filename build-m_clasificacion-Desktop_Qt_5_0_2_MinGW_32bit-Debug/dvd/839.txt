 I hate sit-ups but this video is worth it because it works. I have been losing weight with diet and aerobic exercise and have come to a stand-still so I decided to add some ab work and light resistance training. Within 1-2 weeks of doing this DVD I started receiving compliments of how "skinny" I look. I could fit into my size 10's again because my waist was beginning to trim down! I like this video becuase the instructor is not annoying. She simply tells you what to do without fluff. There is no intro (warm up) which I like. There are six routines to choose from so if I only have 8 minutes I can just do one. If I have enough time I like to do THREE of the six workouts. Which is amazingly hard. It has Beginning and Advanced Versions of BootCamp Abs, Kickboxing Abs, and Strengh Abs
