 I splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday (Devil's Night.) I wanted to have all three films available should I feel the need to watch them again. The concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to me- it seems to be the only kind that really exists.... I wasn't dissappointed in this set. It contains all three of the "collectors series" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features. The profile of James O' Barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good. Plus, there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films. I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted. Sure, the original film is by far the best, almost supernaturally superior, but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision.
