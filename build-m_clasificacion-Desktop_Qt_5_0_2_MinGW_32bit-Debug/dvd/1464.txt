 After I wrote this review, I read other's reviews and thought some were much better than mine, much more expressive. specially Mr. censored's review, you sould read it.It's posted December 2004. The important thing is that you read 3 or 4 reviews and see that nobody is kidding you. This concert is fantastic. Ok now my unedited review: This is the greatest incubus DVD I've seen, and the greatest Incubus thing that I have ever experienced. I've known Incubus for some time now and I can tell you its a great concert, you can really tell how professional the band members are. Throughout the concert you will see extended versions of songs, solos by Mike Einziger and Jos Pasillas. You will experience Incubus as it is, full of energy and power. you can tell these guys are good 'cause the live versions are identical to the recorded versions, but they have that special "live" feel. Or should I say "alive"? This is a must for anyone who admires or likes Incubus
