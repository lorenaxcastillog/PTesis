 I really enjoy the series. Specifically because it is based on the lives of four homosexual black males, which is something unheard of on "Americas's" television network - A gay soap series! Even though African Americans have portrayed homosexual roles on television before, this series almost makes that fact taboo, in the sense that it illustrates the quote on quote everday life of multiple homosexual African American men. I think the plots are very dynamic and the cast is as well. Being that the series compares to much of reality, there can be predictions based on a viewers personal experiences, and in the same breath, there can be suspense. I am very proud to see all of the support not only from the cast, but more so from the viewers. Considering the ratings and popularity of the series, I would have to say that America may be changing just a little. Less than 30 years ago an interracial couple on television was considered taboo... Now we have Noah's Ark.
