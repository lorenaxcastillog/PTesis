 Okay people, Robert Redford is an ATROCIOUS actor. He is a Hormel hamslice prancing around as a vapid left-wing pooh bah. Witness the scene in this film when he is "tired" and answers the phone. Ha! Okay, but on to the movie. The Candidate is apparently for those legions of people out there in America who think they're good enough, they're strong ehough, and gosh darnit they want to make a difference! Oh, but politics is so evil! Well, I would never want a politician like this wimpus calling the shots for me or my family. This film squanders what could have been an insightful look at political ambition, instead Reds-baby is, as always, doofus #1. It helps that the evil Republican is nothing more than a windbag spouting off empty rhetoric. HINT TO FILMAKERS: Movies are more dynamic when there's an interesting, well-defined villian. But, as a political junkie there still was enough here to keep me mildly interested, if only because it's a great portrait of the McGovern-era vapidity of the Left. However, this film fails not because of any political predisposition, for it doesn't even begin to explore the origins of political power.
