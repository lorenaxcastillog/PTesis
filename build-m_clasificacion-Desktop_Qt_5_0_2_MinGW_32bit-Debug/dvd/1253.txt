 For those of you who saw the Dolls back in the '70's, this is a time capsule version that brings you back to Max's Kansas City, Kenny's Castaways, Club 82, and more. The Dolls are young, brash, alive, and vital. Seeing Johnny healthy and built, or Jerry Nolan chubby, it's worth the price of admission. All of the Dolls are energetic and engaging. At the time, the world was their oyster and there was no place to go but up. Great sloppy chaotic versions of their greatest non-hits. A nice feature of the DVD is the Performance Only section, as well as the commentary. It does bog down a little in the middle, but picks right back up again as soon as the band hits the stage. Some of the comments are very funny. The black & white photography lends a "historic" feel. It's way better than it should be, given the time & technology advances since then. It ends around with the Red Patent Leather gigs at the Little Hippodrome, but without fan fare or anything maudlin.
