 You know it's interesting, when you open the Ramtha web site of the "School of Wisdom", one finds a high school essay in NeoPlatonic Metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats, however when you hit the link that says who is Ramtha, you get a "this information is not available" message, kinda makes you go, HHMMMMMMM????!!! now don't get me wrong folks, Edgar Cayce and the author of a Course in Miracles might have tapped into something, but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative, it kind of reminds me of the lines in the Revenge of the Sith movie that Palpatine gave to Anakin to turn him to the dark side!!!!! You know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik, you know esteemed Jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the Sith; or even Tolkien's Saruman, hey folks get Christopher Lee's opinion of the DVD before you fork over your hard earned bucks, and uh...do a search on this Ramtha spirit, er channeled, er thingy!!! Live Long and Prosper!!
