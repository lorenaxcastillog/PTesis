 Barry still has it after 32 years! I have seen him live 18 times in that time period, and he NEVER fails to deliver. I have been to many concerts, some VERY good, but NO ONE can touch Manilow as a live performer. Since I don't know if I'll ever be able to afford a trip to Vegas, this DVD is the next best thing, perhaps even better as I have "The best seat in the house" in my living room! The "Music and Passion" show is excellent, and the added "Vegas Glitz" (lighting and costumes)makes for nice "eye candy" as well. The DVD sound quality is awesome, the band really cooks, and while Barry's voice is (naturally) not the same as when he was younger, many times it does sound exactly the same as then, but it also now has a richer, deeper sound (like a fine wine) that compliments the emotion of his many songs. Don't forget he is not just the consumate showman, but an amazing arranger and composer...every note of music you hear, Manilow is "ultimately" responsible for. Barry is showing Vegas how it's done!
