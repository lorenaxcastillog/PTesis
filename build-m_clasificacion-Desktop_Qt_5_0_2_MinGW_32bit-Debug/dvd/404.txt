 I watched (and liked) the movie, but it didn't leave room for a -good- series to follow or preceed it, so I didn't hold out high hopes for this. When it was available cheap, though, I decided to pick it up - and I'm very glad I did. This is another version of the same story told in the movie, so treat the two as separate. It brings in Mecha, but not as a dominant feature, as well as aspects of starstruck romance, love triangles, and a bit of fantasy intrigue, blending them into a consistent story. I do think parts were a bit drawn out, and the Isaac Newton reference was a bit silly, but these weren't enough to bring down the story. On the other hand, the characters are multifaceted, bringing a healthy range of emotions into play without seeming forced or trite. I mainly took off a point for the artwork and the plot being drawn out at points. The artist doesn't know how to draw a nose (can't say I do either, but I'm not selling my work), which becomes obnoxious at times. If you can get past the noses, it's well worth a look.
