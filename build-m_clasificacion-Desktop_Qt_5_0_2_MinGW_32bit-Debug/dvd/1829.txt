 Werner Herzog is famous for his movies about obssesive maniacs (Aguirre, Fitzcarraldo, etc.). However, it turns out that he has a great sensibility for documentary films. Although this movie is not for everyone -it has a very slow narrative- it is a very important testimony of those people who have lived in the land of darkness (blindness) and silence (deafness). It shows, amongst many other things, how these people live, how they "see" the world (notice how language falls apart here)and how they communicate. A word of advice: there is a shot of a poor child who was born deaf and blind and lived in isolation for several years (imagine a person who has not developed linguistic skills at all). That is one frightening and sordid scene that will give you nightmares. I have a weird obsession with documentaries and love this film; however, if you're not into this genre you may want to rent the dvd first.
