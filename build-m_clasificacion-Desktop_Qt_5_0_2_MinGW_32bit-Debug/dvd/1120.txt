 As I write this, 28 others have already reviewed this box set and 27 of them have given it 5 stars with the lone dissenter giving it a respectable 4 stars. I think that probably speaks for itself. If you need further evidence for the quality of this show consider that it was cancelled after only a season and half, thereby putting it into that depressing Pantheon of shows that were just too good for the average public (other members include: Freak and Geeks, Wonderfalls, My So-Called Life, and Undeclared). Now to the show itself. It's funny and engrossing. Denis Leary and his frequent show-biz cohorts, including Diane Farr, Lenny Clarke, and Adam Ferrara, are convincing in both the dramatic and comedic elements of the show. The writing is smart and inventive-- Leary himself is among the credited writers-- and the characters are people that you'll actually care about. It's sad that series ended so soon, especially since the final episode reveals so much potential for further development, but with this box set you can at least experience 18 episodes of one of the all-time great TV shows
