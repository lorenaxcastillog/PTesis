 I'm familiar with most of the information in this movie but I suspect that a lot of people, the working middle class (which I'm a part of so I know what I'm talking about) are not. They are too busy watching Fox News and listening to talk radio. I hope enough people who are disenchanted with the Bush Administration and their shrinking personal budget would occasionally watch a movie such as this. It's about how the media is biased because it's owned by Corporate America. How deregulation by the Telecommunications Act hurts our nation. They are buying up the small independent stations. Corporate America and the Republicans would love to regulate the internet because there is too much information they prefer we didn't know. They will try to use some pseudo-intellectual reason to censor the internet by euphemist language (like they did with Patriot Act) to brainwash the unquestioning citizens in our country. Please watch this with a family member or friend who is open or ready to re-think their right wing views.
