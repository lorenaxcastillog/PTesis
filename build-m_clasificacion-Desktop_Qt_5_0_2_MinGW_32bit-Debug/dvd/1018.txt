 Meghan White is one of the best dvd instructors out there. She moves you through the workouts so that even though it's burning, and you're sweating, you hear her count "for 4, 3, 2, 1...", and you know you've made it. She's positive and really gets you moving. I started out with the under 15 minute exercises, and I've now moved to the 30 minute one. The one alteration I would do for people with hip bursitis, or back problems, is when you go forward, with your legs "hip width apart", in one of the usual pilates exercises, I always stretch my legs out in a V, with legs wide on opposite sides, and that will help people with back or hip bursitis problems. It releases the back and the psoas muscles. As far as the overall, this is great! I love it. Right now I've been doing the 30 minute Mat exercises and I sweat hard where drips fall off of me! And though currently it's hard for me to do the push ups in that part of it, I will keep trying! Meghan White is the best
