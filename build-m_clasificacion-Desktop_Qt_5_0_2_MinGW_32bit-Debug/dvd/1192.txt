 I'll tell you the truth - I purchased this film only so I could say I now own every movie Alan Rickman has ever done. He, as any fan will tell you, brings vivid life to every character he does. His portrayal of Ed the Artist is absolutely what I expected - well done, although the part was small. Now, for the rest of the movie. I have never witnessed overacting like this in my life -- not even on the high school stage. The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common? Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen. I've given it two stars strictly because of Alan Rickman's involvement in the film and because I did stick it out until the end. If you are a fan, rent this just to hear him say, "Don't molest anything-"..
