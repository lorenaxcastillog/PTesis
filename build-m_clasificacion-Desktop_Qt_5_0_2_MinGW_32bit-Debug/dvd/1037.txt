 Just a note of thanks for all who made these DVD's possible. I had all three concerts on VHS and they are about shot. My favorite is the Grace Under Pressure DVD which I have awaited for many years. Exit Stage Left has some excellant performances as well like Xanadu. A Show of Hands is very well produced and the sound on all three is very good considering the time it was recorded. I have seen Rush live five times starting in 1979 and have always enjoyed thier shows. They are a true fan band that performs perfectly live as these DVD's demonstrate. If you like live concerts that are not full of gimicks and filler than these are the shows you need to see. Excellant musicians playing thier hearts out. Most bands could learn a lot from these guys, especially the more modern bands of today's Hollywood type produced bore bands.
