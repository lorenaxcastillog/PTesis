 I'm glad I didn't let any negative review sway me from getting this disc. While the A&E biography is a "feel good" story of this legend, this disc is much more honest in it's portrayal of Johhny. They don't hide the fact that he had two sides, & W.C. Holland, & brother Tommy Cash recall with great detail what a fully human being the Man in Black really was. The narrator is fine, & the re-enactments are minimal, and needed to tell the types true stories that these wild boys went through. It doesn't take anything away from the story. The disc doesn't focus on his music so much (as there's no full songs presented), as on the man he was. That's ok; I have enough of John's music to compensate for that. I love the guy even more now then before. No sugar coating; just like Johnny would've wanted it.
