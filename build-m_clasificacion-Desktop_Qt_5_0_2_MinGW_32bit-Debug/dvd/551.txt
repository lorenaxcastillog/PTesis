 My wife and I both loved this sweet film. Sure, there are a few holes in the script from a sci-fi POV but if you suspend belief for 2 hours, you'll enjoy this love story, especially if you can share it with someone you love. And isn't that the point of most movies? That is, we suspend belief in the "normal", every day rules of logic, and plunge headfirst into the world of make-believe. Bullock and Reeves (I guess you have to be named "Reeves" to make a film about time-travel love!) have a wonderful chemistry together: they make you believe in the magic of romance. And even though almost everyone will figure out the plot well before the movie's end, there is still one moment that could go either way, which makes it worthwhile. Really, folks - sit back and enjoy this one. Much more worthwhile than brainless, inane flicks like anything starring Jack Black or any of the myriad "teen" comedies
