 Who will ever forget that wonderful scene where Gable is attempting to teach Colbert the art of hitchhiking. After Gable's thumb fails misserably to achieve its goal Colbert decides to try. Standing by the side of the road she demurely pulls up the hem of her dress just enough to reveal her calf, immediately bringing a passing car to a sudden halt. Proving once and for all that "the limb is mightier than the thumb." When you talk about the "Golden Age" of cinema one of the first films that have to come to mind is the '33 classic 'It Happened One Night' directed by Frank Capra and starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. The chemistry between these two Hollywood legends is magical, the script enchanting and the supporting cast superb. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. Simply one of the greatest comedy romances of all-time! One of the Essentials for anyones DVD library.
