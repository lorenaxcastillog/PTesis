 I rented the DVD to see what this series was all about. I admit that I had somewhat skeptical expectations since I tried to watch one random episode when it was being aired on HBO. Watching the series from start to finish - WOW! For all of you who are wondering how two leaders of opposite camps could exist together, more so, be married, I think this series gives them a glimpse of how they (Carville and Matalin) play off of each other -- and it works. The series shows the underside, albeit game playing, of American politics. Viewers may have been thrown if they did not watch the series from the beginning -- but that's all the more reason to buy this DVD set! So disappointed that the series was cut right when it was getting even better, but oh well...great while it lasted. Lastly, John Slattery is hot -- 'nough said.
