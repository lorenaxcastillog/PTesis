 A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs! When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem... Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie. On the negative side, the 11-year old surviving for 8 weeks on Isla Sorna is ridiculous to say the least, not to mention his overly confident attitude throughout the movie! In addition, Allesandro Nivola's character is not all that interesting and that takes away from the enjoyment. In the end you kind of wish he hadn't made it... In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT! Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching and one to consider adding to your movie collection!
