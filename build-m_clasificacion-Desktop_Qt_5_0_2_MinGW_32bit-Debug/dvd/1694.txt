 The other reviews focus more on the plot surrounding the B&W film "Captain Blood" than on some isolated scenes of pure cinematic brilliance. I've seen this movie many times and have enjoyed the chemistry between dashingly handsome Errol Flynn and stunningly lovely Olivia de Havilland more and more with each viewing. Those scenes in particular in which Miss Bishop (de Havilland) is Mistress to Dr. Blood's (Flynn) Slave and then Peter Blood's Master to Arabella Bishop's Slave are full of romantic tension laced with subtle humor, as though both were having fun verbally besting each other. Another great moment was the sword fight on the beach between smiling adversaries Flynn and Basil Rathbone, with Rathbone doing an incredible impersonation of a Dastardly French Pirate. The only other sword fight I can think of that comes close to this one being a classic is in "The Prisoner of Zenda" between Ronald Coleman and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. If you haven't had the opportunity to see this swashbuckling film, rent it and treat yourself to a big bowl of popcorn and be prepared for a rousing adventure. Those were the days when actors knew how to act.
