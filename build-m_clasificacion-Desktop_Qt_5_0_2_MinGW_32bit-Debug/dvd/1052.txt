 OMFG! If you're considering buying this disc, you have enough interest to make getting this 2 disc DVD an absolute MUST. Disc 2 alone is awesome and worth the price, even if only for the acoustic set. I'm a life long fan, have other videos of the Minutemen, and have even seen the live back in the day. But I've never seen this acoustic footage before. It's amazing! History Lesson Pt 2 and, my favorite, "I Felt Like A Gringo" done acoustically is just so nice to finally see. I can, and will watch this over and over again. The other two sets are good as well, but yeah, the camera is a bit blurry, and D Boon's mic is a bit too loud most of the time. But it's as close to being there as you can get. Having seen this band years ago, it was a rush to see and hear them in so many ways once again. So tight, so raw, and so damn fun, bands like this are rare in the history of rock.
