 This DVD is not only visually pleasant but it is more informative than most of the other DVDs out there concerning the area of Rennes le Chateau. It is given from a French perspective by French historians and writers from southern France. It is a departure from Henry Lincolns hypothisis (which still has merit) and it dwells on the main character, Father Sauniere and a strange murder of Father Gelis a priest who lived only three miles from Sauniere and of course, a secret. Taken with Henry Lincolns video, it gives one a much broader picture of the mystery....and more questions. Which for me, is wonderful. I love a good mystery and this one is one of the biggest mysteries in human history. I loved it. I watch it often. There always seems to be some snipets of information that I missed. I recomend it to anyone with an open mind about Christianity and perhaps, human origins
