 This movie has a little bit of everything. We have some funny dialogue for the comedy fans, we have a father getting to know his daughter for the softies, we have Cage as a con artist for the crime movie fans, and we have an unpredictable twist at the end for... well, everyone. Who doesn't like a good twist? Cage gives us a great performance in which he plays a con artist with (it didn't actually say but I'm guessing) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. He's a germ-ophobe and a neat freak who's just spending time with his 14 year old daughter for the first time in his life. Eventually she finds out he's a con artist, and he ends up taking her along on a con. That's where the plot really gets good, and eventually it leads up to the most mind-boggling twist I've ever experienced watching a movie. I was thinking about this movie for about 3 hours afterwards, trying to decide what made it so good, and there really isn't any one specific reason. Great movie for fans of any genre, I highly recommend you rent this
