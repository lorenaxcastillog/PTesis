 can someone answer the following question for me, per favore? as a student of italian language, watching italian films is extremely helpful at mastering spoken dialogue. however, many movies that take place in southern italy are spoken in pure dialect and are NOT proper italian. as i'm on a strict budget, i can't afford to purchase another movie such as "malena", where the actors are not speaking proper italian, and frankly don't even look italian. looking at the actors names in "i'm not scared", for this movie i notice some that don't end in vowels (but rather end in -s, like gabriele salvatores (french?)) or names like diego (spanish for david rather than davide which is proper italian for david). imagining trying to learn proper english by watching the beverly hillbillies? italian southern dialects are essentially a variation of italian bad grammar and makes it very confusing for learners of the most beautiful of all the romance languages. nonetheless, my non-speaking italian friends who saw the film loved it, and the 4 stars are for their review. molto grazie..
