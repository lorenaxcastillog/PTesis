 Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel. Lumi Cavazos is a likeable Tita,struggling with her forbidden passion for Pedro.She's a sympathetic character&conveys her pain with her eyes.For a talented actress,I wonder what has become of her since. Marco Leonardi is not as sympathetic as Pedro.He comes across as a cheating scoundrel,causing pain for both his wife&his forbidden lover.One wonders why Tita loves him so much,except that it's forbidden.Marco Leonardi is,however,being true to the book.He uses Tita for his own pleasure;instead of bravely marrying her,he is a coward in marrying her sister&cheating on her. The movie renders less magical,or powerful,the scenes in the book.Instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti Western.One expects to see John Wayne riding to Tita's rescue. The magical scenes are hardly convincing,even for their time.The movie does have an excellent soundtrack.It's far inferior to the delectable,sensual novel
