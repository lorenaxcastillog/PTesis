 Baby Boom starring one of the greatest actress' of all time, Diane Keaton is a sweet, heartwarming film about a successful businesswoman who gets an unexpected surprise... a baby! One of her relatives dies and she is held responsible for looking after and raising Elizabeth, a cute little girl who forever changes the life of J.C. Wyatt (Keaton). The film also stars a young and conniving business associate James Spader and Sam Shepard who plays a potential love interest for J.C. halfway through the film after J.C. deicides to leave her high-paying job and move to the "quiet" country, a place she has always dreamt of living. This is Keaton's signature and best role I think, of course I love her in Annie Hall but there is something special about her performance in Baby Boom that keeps me coming back to watch this delightful little film. I highly recommend this boom of a film
