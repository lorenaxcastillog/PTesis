 I too was mesmerized by this documentary, as an educator and student of child psychology, etc. THen I heard the running commentary, especially the remarks of the cameraman, and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is: using despised children for selfish purposes=prostitution. THe cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b#tch (his words) and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls. The inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise. Often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm, as Mr. Oscar Wilde noted. This despicable film takes kids, uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman, divides families and friendships, exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition, like Liza Dolittle, without hope of going either back or forward. The pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling
