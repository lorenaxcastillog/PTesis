 The first time I saw this film was when it came out in 1986, and at the time I was terribly disappointed. Didn't like the film at all, thought it was amateurish and pretentious. But then I watched it recently on DVD, and realized that it was a really good film - performances were all really good, I liked seeing the DC scenery, and the directing by Mike Nichols was wonderfully subtle. Despite the fact that both Nicholson and Streep can sometimes be overpowering, and that Nicholson did get a bit hammy at times in this (I still can't abide the scene where he sings), I found both of their performances to be deep and nuanced. The co-stars were good too, added a lot, and I especially enjoy Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of a gossip. Carly Simon's singing really does set the tone well for this movie, which is definitely worth watching. And if you don't like it the first time, watch it again in a year or two, and I'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively
