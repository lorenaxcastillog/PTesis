 I read the very lengthy review that I saw first, and I must say I was appalled. I don't know if your from a different generation, thats fine, but no need to criticize the generations that follow. This has been one of my favorite movies for years. We find Winona Ryder, valevictorian of her university working as an assistant for a cocky talk show host. Finally she retaliates against her position working for the man when she is overqualified for the job. Janeane Garofalo, however, is the hippy of the movie. She enjoys 70's music, and 70's apparel, working at the Gap. Ethan Hawke is a genuis who feels that anything he does is almost a waste of his time until he gets a family wake up call. Steve Zahn is a man who is coming to terms with his sexuality. This is not a movie of losers, this is four people graduating from college, and dealing with the problems in life. Everything is scary once you graduate, and your parents give you the freedom to go without any more assistance. I think this was a great movie with a great soundtrack and an excellent cast getting their start.
