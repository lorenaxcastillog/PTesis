 My friend got me hooked into ER a year ago and I could not stop watching it. I watch the episodes every Thursday on NBC, but this movie is the best of all. I got this for Christmas one year, and since then I have probably seen it 20 times. It gives me a good feeling whenever I watch it, which horror movies can't do, and I love horror movies (just click see more about me to find out!) The music sets the tone for the movie. The movie is perfect and I couldn't see how it could get any better. It is weird to think that only a few characters from this movie still live on in the show today. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes hospitals, medical dramas, or just anyone who likes that feeling of a good movie. That is how good this movie is
