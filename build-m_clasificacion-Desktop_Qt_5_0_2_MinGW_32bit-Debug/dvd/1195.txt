 Personally, I don't think I would resort to murder, but for the four brothers in this movie there was no doubt how far they would go. Set off by the police force's lack of effort (in their eyes) in finding their adoptive mother's killer, the four brothers take vigilante justice to a whole new level. Nearly lost in the plot of killing, corruption and revenge though is a story about family, loyalty and love, even respect (for the woman who raised them mostly). I was touched by their Thanksgiving meal where they each saw her, except Bobby, who finally saw her at the end. Josh Charles plays another smarmy, dirty cop (like he did in SWAT) and Garrett Hedlund does an amazing job as the troubled, youngest brother who tries so hard to make the older ones proud. A well done piece by Singleton for sure, it could have been set in any large city but he picked Detroit. Interesting. This movie is very gritty and violent, but I was drawn right in and everytime I thought I had it figured out there was another twist
