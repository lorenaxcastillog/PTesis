 Starting in 1995, the New York City program in ballroom dance now includes 6000 children from all burroughs of the city. This documentary observes 11 year olds learning body discipline, social etiquette, appropriate attire on their way to achieving a sense of self respect, personal dignity. Some of the children inhabit neighborhoods where they stumble across drug addicts and dealers each day. The teachers of 3 different schools reveal secret tricks to overcome physical and social awkwardness in children and open them to their potential for becoming accomplished through structure, practice and smiling. The children openly discuss their fears (my dad cheated on my mom) and hopes (do you like girls?) between classes as they march toward the selection process for the citywide competition (bronze, silver, gold levels) quarter, semi-finals and the glorious finals outdoors in sunlight. The music is charming nostalgic, the dancing exhilarating; the children's enjoyment of their bodies in motion is contagious. Recommend also seeing the original Japanese DVD Shall We Dance? to see the transformative power of dance to change adult self image and relationships.
