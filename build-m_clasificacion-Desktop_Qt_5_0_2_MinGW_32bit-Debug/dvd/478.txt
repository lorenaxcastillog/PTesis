 I decided to order a copy of this DVD when my son was still under a year. It was definitely too advanced for him then, but now at 20 months this is BY FAR his favorite movie. He watches most of the DVD which includes little kids/babies in the intro, Old MacDonalds Farm, an ABC of animals, and sections on different kinds of animal (furry faced animals, animals with fins and flippers, etc. etc.). He has even started answering some of the questions (what animal makes this sound, etc.)--so it's a bit more interactive for him. This is a great DVD to add when your child is getting too old for the Baby Einstein videos because it offers a lot more information. For example, it gives solid information such as "Did you know a cow has 4 stomachs?" and goes over the names of baby animals and groups of animals. This definitely gets 5 stars from my son (and me) these days!
