 This movie is amazing. Luke Perry does a great job playing rodeo great, Lane Frost. The movie follows the true story of Lane Frost, and although parts of this movie were created by Hollywood (there was no Martin Hudson, Kellie wasn't there in the end, Cody didn't write poems, etc.) it is still a great movie. Luke Perry plays Lane Frost, Luke does a great job portraying Lane. Lane's parents, Clyde and Elsie, attended throughout the filming of the movie. As did Lane's best friend, Tuff Hedeman. Tuff could sometimes be heard speaking to Luke and saying "Lane wouldn't do it that way", so Luke would stop what he was doing, and start all over, doing it until he got it right. If you overlook the few "Hollywood" moments, this is a great movie. It is without a doubt my favorite movie, and I hope it will be yours too. It's a great movie for rodeo fans of all ages, and even if you're not a fan of rodeo, you will be a fan of Lane's by the time this movie is over
