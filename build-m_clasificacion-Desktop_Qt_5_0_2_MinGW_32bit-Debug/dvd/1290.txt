 Everone else already said this is the &quot;best dvd EVER&quot; so there is no point repeating that... I will simply add to it my favorite qualities... The absolute best thing is the live acoustic performace they did in Cali.... they redid A Certian Shade of Green to sound totally chill... the singing notes are even completely different. When you enter the vegas option each time you click on it it shows something different (one of those things you just have to own it to understand). It has all their already made videos on there which is great since I liked them w/o ever seeing a video until this dvd. Take me to your leader is a funny video. It's just plain cool... even if you don't like Incubus music (how could you not), just get the dvd for good laughs. Only drawback.. it doesn't play everything straight through, sometimes you have to click on each individual thing
