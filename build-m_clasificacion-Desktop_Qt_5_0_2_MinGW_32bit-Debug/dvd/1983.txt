 This wonderful, humble, simple film is so very compassionate, loving and sincere that you may wonder, "how is this possible?" How is it that someone in the '90's could dare make a film devoid of irony, sarcasm or bitterness? It seems a miracle that Kurosawa was allowed to make a film which has, as it's main point, human kindness and love. This film makes me wish that I were a better person. It makes me think about mortality and one's legacy, and it makes me think about the people I love. Good old Kurosawa...always urging us on to make the difficult choices to live better, truer, more socially responsible lives. See if you don't watch this film, then call your mother, or check in on your brother or sister, or reconnect with an old friend. It's the kind of film that shows you how precious our human relationships are, and what a gift this life can be.
