 Mari Winsor has changed my life!!! I know this sounds infomercialist but she really did!! i was really overweight and almost 2 years ago I decided to really get serious about weight loss. I ordered this series but as usual it took me months to actually use the tapes. When I did, no lie, the first week I noticed my posture was more erect, my stomach had lifted a tad. I was amazed because usually unless I see some sort of improvement within 30 days, I stop. I didn't expect to see something the first week. You talk about motivation. I have since ordered eveything that she comes out with. If you have monster thighs such as myself, she has a pilates tape or DVD specifically for buns and thighs, her upper body tape literally melts fat off your neck and face within days. By the way, Target sells the series for $40 now. Hope I helped someone. I only have 40 pounds to get off now, I just ordered a new dvd from her, wish me luck!
