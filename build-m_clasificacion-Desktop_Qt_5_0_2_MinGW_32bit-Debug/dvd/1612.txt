 I can't believe I'm the first to say something about this film. I have not yet seen this film. But I'm ordering it and hope to see it soon and revise this "review". A friend of mine tells me it is a remarkable, an INCREDIBLE film. "... and most INCREDIBLE is visiting the home area of a million or so swifts. the end of the movie...even now i cry sitting here. (not sad, just awed)" The New York Times says it's "Filled with breathtaking images." And declares Herzog is "One of the greatest and most originals of documentary filmmakers." The Christian Science Monitor calls it "Touching, transfixing, unique." Roger Ebert says "it earns its place among the other treasures and curiosities in Herzog's work." Based on seeing previous Herzog films -- Aguirre, Kasper Hauser, Fritzcaraldo, Nosferatu, etc -- I expect nothing less. To say Herzog makes interesting, thought provoking films is an understatement. More details after I see the film. So, see the film and let's see what YOU say about Herzog's "The White Diamond"
