 I recently returned to work full-time after having my second child and found I had little time left to myself. I needed a workout that could be done in 30 minutes or less so I ordered this 2-Disc package and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. Since I was very active the weeks following my child's birth (exercising 40-60 minutes 6 days a week) I was worried such a short workout would not be enough to challenge me. I was wrong. Both workouts are very fast-paced and effective. I am completely drenched in sweat when I complete each one and I feel strong and energized - just what I need to get me through the day. Plus I like Jillian's no-nonsense attitude and how she pushes you to your limits and beyond. I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who wants to get great results in the minimum amount of time
