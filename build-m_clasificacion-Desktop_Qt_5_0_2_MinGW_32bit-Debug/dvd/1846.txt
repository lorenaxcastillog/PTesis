 When I first saw this film, I thought of it as one of Tim Burton's more unusual efforts. But as time has gone by, it has become to touch me on many levels. The music and "choir" backup lends a true heart-warming and mystical quality that can be compared to "The Wizard of Oz". The scene where Ryder dances in the snow created by Edward's ice carving is unforgettable. She is able to celebrate who this person is--and love him as well. If I could edit out the attempted rape of Edward by the town slut (and a few ill-chosen profanities), I would show this film to youngsters. But I leave it as an adult tale of a love that could never be fully consumated. It is the story of the freak who is castoff by the pastel-colored "normal" people who never comprehend or appreciate that special individual who is Edward Scissorhands. I hope we never see a sequel, for this work stands alone as a modern day classic.
