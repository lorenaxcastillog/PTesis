 U2 is one of only a handful,if any,band's that have been around for 25 years or more with all original members.And it shows,it's easy to forget that there are only three musicians onstage playing 95 percent of the show.The band comes onstage while the house lights are still on and procede to go into their first number "Elevation" while they stay on until halfway through the song.Many great songs fill the hall all through the dvd.Superb sound and picture will please any viewer,only when the "Bono -Cam" angle is pictured does it become slightly blurry."In a Little While" is performed to perfection,so is "Bad" and many others.Notably missing is "One",probably U2's greatest song ever put to sound,so is "Pride(In the Name of Love)" and a few others.It is still a very solid performance by four of the greatest Irish rockers to ever walk the earth.The second dvd is pure bonus features,music videos and alternate camera angles on certain songs from the first dvd,easter eggs are also included in both dvd's(good luck!).This collection belongs in every U2 fan's library,it could very well even bring a tear to your eyes.Enjoy this brilliant concert from Bono and the gang..
