 There is not much more that I can say that has not already been said. Yet, I must admit that I am seeing this for the first time about a week after Robert Altman receive his honorary Oscar. Altman is a director that I have long admired ("Short Cuts" is a favorite) even if I haven't always liked too many of his films ("The Player" is terribly smug and self-seving while "Ready To Wear" is just plain bad). He is an artist and original of such rare quality that his works completely deserve the respect they get. With "Nashville", I was blown away, after being a little restless with it in its first third. I think it's a brilliant film that is shockingly prophetic in its attitudes towards politics, the deepening quagmire of the public's quest for fame at any cost and desipte some tender moments, there was this unnerving sense of paranoia running through it that completely makes this film stand the test of time. "Nashville" is very much a product of its time but the stories and messages are timeless. I must add this film to my DVD library.
