 Yes!!I was extremely excited when I saw that the MI tv series was finally going to be released on dvd.I've been waiting for a long time for them to come out.Although,I don't really remember the episodes that I used to watch back in the day,I can only say that it was a well thought out show,with great plots and stories.For those people who never saw the tv series,they will enjoy it today as much as us "older people" enjoyed watching it many years ago.I think that they will find it to be very entertaining.The tv series was way ahead of its time.Not like the early James Bond movies versus the more up to date movies with all of the stunts and special fx.I think the tv show is still relevant today.The show had excellent writing.The MI movies captured very little of the original plot structure of the tv series,except for the opening scene of the first movie.that scene was what the tv series was all about,a lot of deception going on.I will buy every one of the sets as soon as they are released.Thank you paramount
