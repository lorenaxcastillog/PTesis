 Bullets Over Broadway is an extraordinary comedy directed by Woody Allen (Annie Hall) and starring a hilarious cast including John Cusack (Say Anything), Dianne Wiest (Footloose), Jennifer Tilly (Liar Liar), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Rob Reiner (Sleepless In Seattle), Jim Broadbent (Iris), Mary Louise Parker (The Client), and Jack Warden (Night And The City). Cusack plays David Shayne, a struggling 1920's playwright who finally wraps up a new script. He's able to convince a has-been actress Helen Sinclair, played by Wiest in her Oscar winning role, and a distinguished English actor Warner who has a huge appetite, played by Broadbent. The only way that David will be able to have his play hit broadway is if he allows a gangster's lover Olive, played by Tilly, who proves to be a terrible actress. Just when David thinks things are going bad, Olive's gangster bodyguard Cheech, played hysterically by Palminteri, interferes with David's script and demands to make changes, while Warner and Olive begin a secret affair. The film's comedic approach and Woody Allen's brilliant directing and screenplay makes Bullets Over Broadway a splendid film, and one of the best comedies of the past 15 years. Recommended
