 The film is well-done in all aspects, definitely worth seeing if you have any interest in the way the world began to track the AIDS epidemic back around 1980. I was a newspaper editor in Oklahoma at the time, and I remember the early news stories which first hinted that something big and bad was brewing in the gay community. Although I am straight, I have friends of that sexual preference, and in fact, one of my sister's oldest and dearest friends was an early casualty of this killer disease. Even better than this movie, however, is the source book by the late Randy Shilts, who was a journalist in San Francisco (who happened to be gay, and who happened to contract and die of AIDS eventually.) The non-fiction book is huge, but it is gripping. AIDS is still with us, and is a heterosexual scourge in Africa, so this story is not as dated as one might think.
