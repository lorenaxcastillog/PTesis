 It's a shame this show was cancelled in it's prime. The 3rd season was one of the best (though each season is fantastic and holds it's own) season 3 had some of the most hilarious situations Jeri would get herself into. Getting an STD, a boyfriend who wants to keep her a secret, and having a run-in with a school bully are just a few of the wacky episodes in this season. The reason I especially love this season set is the fact that there is a very extensive blooper reel on it and a dance sequence compilation, both of which are HYSTERICAL. It's a shame they didn't include blooper reels for each season, but this one on the 3rd season set contains bloopers from all the seasons together, so it works out. Being that the 'Strangers' sets are so inexpensive, even if you haven't watched the show before, you definitely should pick a set up and give it a shot. If you like crazy off the wall, politcally incorrect and just plain WEIRD humor, this is for you
