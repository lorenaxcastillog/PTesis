 "In My Country" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale. This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide. Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters. How did it turn out? Take a look at the DVD extras: Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found. This is a man who knows quality and knows junk. He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could. Good move. Smart guy
