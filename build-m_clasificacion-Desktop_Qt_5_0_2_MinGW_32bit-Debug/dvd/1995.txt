 This rare TV concert is a great collector's piece. The video quality is good at best, although the "advertising hype" insists that it's beautiful. It is a film transfer and has been cleaned beautifully [de-speckled], but at the expense of crispness. I find some of the additional "bonus" material boring. Still it's a definite "keeper." The extra footage from a deleted section [Mein Herr] is a treat to watch and apparently has not been "cleaned," maybe on purpose, so that we can see what the original aging film looked like before restoration, which I heard took on-and-off ... six years to complete. The A&E segment puts me to sleep, the GLAAD Awards stuff is so-so, but the Liza and John Kander chatting piece is interesting. A CD, "Liza with a Z," accompanies the DVD in this edition. I have not listened to it yet but when I do... it will be nice to hear it without all those ticks and pops [my vinyl record from 30 years ago]
