 The review for this movie on Amazon says it's an "Environmentally friendly animated film with a strong message that doesn't club anyone over the head" WHAT? This movie smacked me right in the face with its blatantly unadulterated political correctness! Let's not pretend that it doesn't. That out of the way, I will say that I LOVE this movie. I saw this in the theater with about 6 other people, all adults and all 7 of us came out of there really happy with it. I have to make a confession though, I am a bit biased, because I love anything, with Tim Curry in it, he could star in the life story of the guy who invented dental floss and I would watch it with glee. That aside, Robin Williams does steal the show with Batty; Hexxus is in a close second. This is one of those rare movies that I will watch maybe once a year, I love when I have to baby-sit and they pick this one out, I thank baby Jesus that they didn't pick out Scooby Doo again.
