 This movie takes place in a small town isolated on an Island off Maine. And as the title suggest, it is hit by the worse storm ever. Snow so thick it is hard to see through and wind so strong that the waves of the ocean start to claim buildings. This alone would make for an exciting adventure movie. But of course King gives us more. A truly supernatural villain comes to town and knows everyone secrets. He starts to kill them off and keeps asking to be given `what he wants." As we watch the movie we are trying to figure out what he wants...and also wondering why the villagers do not give it to them. The movie is suspenseful. And the acting is great. Everyone in this movie acts well, including the children. Of course the best is Colm Feore as the villain Andre Linge, and Tim Daly as the town Constable Michael Anderson. Better then most movies made today. Only thing I would have added, is for a book to have been written.
