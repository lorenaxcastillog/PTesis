 "Singles" is written & directed by Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, and Vanilla Sky) and features an all-star cast including Matt Dillon, Bridget Fonda, Kyra Sedgwick, and Bill Pullman. The film also features Chris Cornell (formerly of Soundgarden, currently of Audioslave) and the members of Pearl Jam (Eddie Vedder & Co.). The film follows several stories; One is about Cliff (Dillon) the lead singer of Seattle band Citizen Dick. Cliff is under the impression that he's a rock god (the members of Pearl Jam are his band with Eddie Vedder on drums) and is worshipped by his neighbor Janet (Fonda). Meanwhile we follow the story of Linda (Sedgwick) who has had enough of guys and decides to stay single until she meets Steve (Campbell Scott). It's an awesome movie for anyone who dug the Seattle grunge scence; The soundtrack rocks, featuring songs by Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mother Love Bone, The Smashing Pumpkins, Alice in Chains, The Lovemongers, etc. The movie is well acted, Fonda is hot; Dillon is very cool and funny. The movie is well written and very entertaining. A few parts of the film fall short; but other than that. Don't pass it up. B
