 "The King of Marvin Gardens" is an example of why the seventies was such a golden period in American filmmaking in that studios as well as stars would take a chance on offbeat material regardless of it's box office potential. Director Bob Rafelson creates a haunting story of disparate souls who cling to hopes that are as faded as the Atlantic City facade they inhabit. Jack Nicholson effectively plays against type as a radio personality who joins up with his brother(Bruce Dern) to partake in his latest get-rich-quick scheme that has all the earmarks of going up in flames. They are joined by Ellen Burstyn as a faded beauty queen who's along for the ride in the futile hope of attaining a dream. This film is not easy to watch at times but the more ambitious viewer can appreciate filmmaking that dares to challenge it's audience. Gorgeous cinematography of the Atlantic City landscape before the casinos were erected.
