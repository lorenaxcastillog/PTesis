 Whisper of the Heart is a wonderful story about a schoolgirl, Shizuku, who is worried about her future. What will she be? What can she do? When she meets Seiji, a mysterious boy who seems to be able to do anything, her fears for her future increases. So she starts out to follow her dreams, to see how far she can get. Will she prove able to meet her goals and fulfill her dreams or will she fail, lost and with no direction in life? In addition to the main plot there is also a touch of romance and fantasy. The two disc set includes some special features but don't buy it for the extras. The movie is the one and only reason to buy the set. Brought to us by the folks of Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro) which is a studio I feel great respect for. They really make good anime, with high standards and touching stories that don't talk down to the viewers, be they adults or kids.
