 A very pleasant surprise, Guarding Tess, brings to the screen the story of a secret service agent guarding the widow of a former president and all that that entails. Could he possibly be biting more than he can chew? Even though the American Founding Fathers would probably not be pleased with the way their successors have been abusing their powers and with the "royal" treatment that they have been receiving (a far cry from the original humility and anti-monarchist rhetoric), one cannot stand idle and not recognize the strong bond that developed between the former first lady and her protector. Nicolas Cage, Shirley MacLaine, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, Guarding Tess is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! 4 1/2 Stars
