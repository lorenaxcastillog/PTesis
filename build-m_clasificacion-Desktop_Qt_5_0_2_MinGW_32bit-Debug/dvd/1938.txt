 I think this dvd is perfect example of gilmour's talent and musicianship outside the context and smoke and lasers of the Pink Floyd stigma. In this minimal environment it was refreshing to see his true gift for music shine on. We can only hope that this could spur on a bigger and more consistent solo career from him outside of the Pink Floyd identity. We as his fans deserve the treat to hear new stuff from him and he could only continue to grow and soar to a higher musical ground. I have always felt that even though Pink Floyd was so successful iconic and great, that it did kinda block a truer essence of David Gilmour and that he sacrificed his individual artistic identity for years in the name of Pink Floyd. Perhaps he wants it this way. Who Knows? In this performance, his voice has a amazing softness and character. his guitar feel is amazing as usual and his demand for the best arrangements and technical sound makes this video a very high quality musical experience and to top it off it was great to see Michael Kamen on stage. His back up choir, amazing as well.
