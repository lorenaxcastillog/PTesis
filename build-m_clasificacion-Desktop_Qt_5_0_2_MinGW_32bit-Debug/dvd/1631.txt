 I saw this movie in a theater (on a double bill with Harold and Maude). The "alternate" ending is the ending that I saw...so obviously it was not removed for theatrical release, but apparently to make the movie less shocking for television audiences or video buyers. Why you would continue to release the dumbed down happy ending version on tape and DVD with the original (and far superior, though far blacker)ending added as an "alternate" is beyond me. The happy ending looks rough and wrong-it is just too abrupt, since all they really did was chop off the last five minutes of the movie! I am confused as to how and why you would leave in the elaborate rape joke but demur on Gordon apparently doing Mamma at the end. It seems to me that if you can't take the original ending you should be horrified by the whole movie! SURELY this was never shown on TV-gorilla rape and all? Every other word is the F-bomb as well. If this was altered for TV, there must not have been much left when they were finished. It was still funny, after all these years-just didn't like the hacked off ending
