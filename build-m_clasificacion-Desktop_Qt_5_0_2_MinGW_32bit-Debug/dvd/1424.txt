 Movie buffs look for attractive leading ladies, handsome gentlemen, unpredictable suspense, or witty humor. Hitchcock makes no compromises in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Mistaken identity leads to life-threatening consequences as criminals seek to kill a government agent. Most people would be content to escape with their life but Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) wants justice. His tenaciousness leads to his being framed for murder. Fortunately the government is well aware of the facts. The solution, of course, is to hire him as the unwilling government agent he is assumed to be. Sultry Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is a trophy of conflicting agendas and men's desires. Dangerous Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) is not willing to share her and for the sake of Roger's life she tries not to be shared though the latter is her romance preference. Eve therefore becomes incentive for Roger to become an earnest agent on a mission to rescue the desire of his heart. Movie quote: "The moment I meet an attractive woman, I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her.
