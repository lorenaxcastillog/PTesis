 I was 25 in 1985 and remember watching a big chunk of Live Aid on tv. Didn't have a VCR back then, and it's been an awfully long wait to see this legendary concert - but worth it! The performance of Queen, as many have stated here, is worth the price of the entire box set. I was fortunate to see Queen live in 1978 and have never forgotten it. But their performance in London at Live Aid is hands down one of the most electrifying sets you'll ever see. You will not be able to sit still. Freddie Mercury was probably the greatest frontman ever to grace a concert stage. He is sorely missed today. Dire Straits were awesome too, and U2 as well. For the Philly show, I'd have to say Simple Minds and Mick Jagger had the best sets. I could have done without the Chevy Chase/Jack Nicholson introductions, because they were pretty lame. Enjoy this DVD set! Now for the big question - when will it be released on CD?!
