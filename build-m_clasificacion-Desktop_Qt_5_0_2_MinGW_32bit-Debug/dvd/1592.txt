 There are some John Water's movies that are hardly watchable because of the poor script, filming and acting like Pink Flamingos and Mondo Trasho. John Water's work started to improve with the make of Hairspray. Then Crybaby, serial mom, and cecil b demented proved that Water's can make some excellent comedies. A Dirty Shame combines the raunch of Desperate Living and Female Trouble with the high tech filming and direction of Cry Baby and Serial Mom. This movie is lighter and easier to watch than any of his dark or disgusting comedies. If this movie wasn't making me laugh which it did several times then it was entertaining me which is what I expect when I see a movie. The characters in this movie are hilarious and so are all the situations. There is frontal nudity,foul and perverse language and of course tons of off the wall innuendo and humor. I'd suggest you watch or buy this movie if you like sex comedies or comedies in general.
