 I got this, I already had "Jurassic Park" on VHS, but I wanted it on DVD. And I'd never seen "Lost World" before. I actually liked it, not as much as "Jurassic Park" but it was still good, oh, and one more thing, the "Jurassic Park III" trailer SUCKS! In part one, Doctors Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are invited by John Hammond to spend a weekend at Jurassic Park. On the way they meet Dr. Ian Malcolm, and as Hammond says, "I bring scientists, you bring a rock star." He says it to Donald Gennaro, head of InGen, the company bringing dinosaurs back to life. Well, a man named Nedry sets everything wrong, and the dinosaurs escape and wreak havoc, 'cause they were behind electrified wire, and Nedry turned it off. In part two, Hammond asks Malcolm to visit Site B. They visit it and all the animals are loose. They have to get to the communications center in the center of the island, infested by raptors, to get out. And I won't ruin the spectacular ending for you. Adios, amigos
