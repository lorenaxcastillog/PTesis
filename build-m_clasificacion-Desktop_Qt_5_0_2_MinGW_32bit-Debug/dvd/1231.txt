 (3.5/5 stars) This movie brings to mind some action-adventure movies of old, such as "Gunga Din" or "Bengal Brigade." Despite the efforts of its keepers, a mummy is inadvertently awakened. It terrorizes a group of treasure seekers and archaeologists with its rather flamboyant magic. Will he be stopped before enslaving humanity? I prefer T.P. to CGI, but CGI's appeal is understandable, especially on such a large scale as this. There is also too much humor in this film. Sparse amounts, sprinkled intermittently, might suit the adventurous mindset of the movie, but it was carried too far here. Apparently the intent was to distance this from the 1932 horror film as far as possible. The likeable Brendan Fraser fits the action hero role well, and I have given this three star movie an extra ï¿½ star since it also features the beautiful Rachel Weisz. This belongs in the same category as "Pirates of the Caribbean" because both are enjoyable, but not great by any means.
