 I am writing this review having just viewed this DVD. I noticed on the DVD package that the running time is supposed to be 124 minutes. But when playing the DVD, the actual runtime was 104 minutes. I am curious if anyone knows if there actually was a longer version or if this is really a typo. Robert Shaw is the Hans Gruber character - European with lofty ambitions, Another bad guy is the one with the knowledge of the system, another is a blood hungry trouble-maker. Walter Matthau is the perfect anti-hero John McClane character as the befuddled Subway detective. This movie is a great portrait of how New York works, as well an insight into the workings of the Subway system. I saw a man in NYC wearing a t-shirt that said "Let me drop everything I'm doing and help you with your problem", which kind of sums up the attitudes of the major players in this race-against-the-clock hostage drama. I give it a 7 out of 10
