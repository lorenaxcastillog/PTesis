 "Tastes so good, it'll make you want to slap your momma"!! This is just one the hilarious quotes from "Friday After Next". This is one seriously funny movie. If you don't just bust-up with laughter, then you are probably already dead. Ice Cube and his buddy Mike Epps deliver one Hell of a good Christmas themed comedy. This time around, Ice Cube plays his role to the max, and manages to showcase the "Craig" character in ways not shown in the two previous "Friday" films. Craigs entire family are here, engaged in antics wild and crazy enough to make anyone roll with laughter. The whole "Bro's Bar-B-Q" scene alone, makes this a film not to miss. I watched this film again, while visiting friends in the Philippines. And the Filipinos laughed eved harder than my American friends did! It seems that Ice cube's movies are a big hit all over the world. So I say get yourself a copy of "Friday After Next", and invite some friends over to watch it. This is one movie worth adding to your comedy film collection. Ice Cube always delivers, and this time, he really takes care of business.
