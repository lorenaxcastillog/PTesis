 Once upon a time there were some very interesting movies made. This was during the 1980s. Some directors had some interesting ideas about showing how high school can have quirky moments and be educational sometimes but also give life lessons that will help down the road. Even the teachers have political viewpoints, not just parents. Maybe not anymore. After all that wouldn't be politically correct any more to talk about that in class. I feel sorry for students today, so many things are not allowed I don't know how they can learn anything about life and having a personality. Well back to this movie. It is Jon Cryer's best from all his movies that I have seen. Funny and suspenseful with some love thrown in for romantics. Cryer is a stock broker, Andrew Morenski, that finds himself on the run from hitmen. He hides out with a nephew and finds that being high school student, Max Hauser, is a good cover. Cryer is excellent and the rest the supporting cast are great as well. Any fan of movies like &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; will probably love it
