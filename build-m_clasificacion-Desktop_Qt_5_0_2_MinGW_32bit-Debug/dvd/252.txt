 I'm not sure why Sony Home Entertainment decided to start releasing "Archie Bunker's Place" on DVD before "All in the Family" was finished, nor do I know why they picked such a goofy-looking picture of Archie to put on the cover (What's up with that grin? He looks like a doofus!). However, I will still be purchasing this box set to go along with the AITF sets. Even though it's not as good as the original series, it's still worthy to own, especially when the episodes are the original uncut versions. As usual, Amazon is the best place to buy it from since it's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there's free shipping to boot! Buying this release will only serve to give the publisher more faith in anything with Archie Bunker, so the rest of the AITF seasons might not be too far behind. So, here's a good place to cast your vote for it! You'll enjoy this set for sure
