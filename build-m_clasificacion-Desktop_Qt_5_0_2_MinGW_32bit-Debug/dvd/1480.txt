 Yes, it is a simple, uncomplicated story. Yes, they could have developed the relationship between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald a little more. But despite its minor faults, this is one of my very favorite movies. It's a wonderful story that could easily have remained just a local legend, but I'm glad it didn't. I found the interactions between the Englishmen and the Welsh villagers hilarious, as well as the continuing sabotage of the Englishmens' attempts to leave the village. I thought the storyline about "Johnny shell-shocked" added just the right amount of depth without being overdone. And the end of the movie was quite satisfying, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I'm just an old sap, but I enjoy this story. And I love that they show the actual mountain/hill at the end, along with the children of the people represented in the film. If you want to watch a movie that presents an engaging story without unnecessary embellishment, this is a good choice
