 I, as probably many other people, got this movie after I watched "Memento", the second movie by the same director, Christopher Nolan, which I liked very much. I liked his first one too, although probably the comparison with his follow up Hollywood production makes 'Following' even more interesting. It is low budget independent movie in noir style that is shot in black and white. The style of the movie reminds me old french crime movies although it adds the twists so familiar to us from 'Memento': the order of the movie doesn't follow the real order so you see different pieces in different times trying to recreate what really happened. The plot itself, although unpredictable (the ending is totally surprising) not really convincing and logical. But it's ok since, in my opinion, the main quality of this movie is its style. The acting is adequate. All in all although not groundbreaking it is interesting especially as prequel to 'Following'
