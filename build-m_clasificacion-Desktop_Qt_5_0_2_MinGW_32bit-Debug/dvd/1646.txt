 shows the innocence and naivete of teens until someone takes it away from them. young stella is infatuated with the quite handsome but gay(unknown to her despite all the very obvious signs and outright displays) director. eners the aging but always dashingly sexy mr rickman, runored to have gotten a local girl pregnant some years ago in this town, surrounded by women his own age who seemingly would do anything to get him to give them a second look. but, alas, his sights are set on the 16 year old virgin who doesn't equate sex with love but as a way to fit in with the world and people of the theater. the ending is extremely sad and one wonders if stella will hold herself resposible for the cruel fate of rickman and how this will affect her ability to establish "healthy" relationships in her future. luckily, it appears she will never know the dark secret her lover takes to his grave
