 It's a true blue spectacle miracle come true! Barry Manilow on DVD doing his Las Vegas show for those of us who cannot get tickets to this spectacular! Decade after decade, album after album (now CD's), Barry Manilow is a true entertainer, a true showman along the lines of Sinatra and Elvis. Whether seeing him in person or listening in the car radio, there is never a doubt that he is giving at least 110%. This DVD performance is no exception. Like a fine wine, his voice has mellowed and richened with age. He is a generous entertainer, not afraid to let his back up singers and band have their time in the spotlight. His audience loves him and he definitely returns the feeling. The DVD is fast-paced and chocked full of songs touching on his many styles---from his early "Midnight Special" hits to his current "back in the 50's" song catalog. The audience is boisterous and appreciative and Barry plays off them well. Slip the DVD into the player, dim the lights and enjoy the smooth and stylish songs from the always classy Mr. Manilow
