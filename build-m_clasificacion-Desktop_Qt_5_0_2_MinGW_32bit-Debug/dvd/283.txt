 The Gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by Billy Bob Thornton, the talented man that also wrote Sling Blade. First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. Why? Because of the incredible cast. Here, you'll find probably one of the best casts ever. It has Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, an actor whom I can't remeber his name but who is brilliant and Keannu Reeves. Keannu Reeves? A good actor? Damn straight. He was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. I am not kidding. His performance was remarquable! The movie is about a widow, mother of 3, making her money as a psychic. But, she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything. This psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person. And only one. You'll find that one out on your own. This movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. So, watch this brilliant movie that I will definitely add to my collection
