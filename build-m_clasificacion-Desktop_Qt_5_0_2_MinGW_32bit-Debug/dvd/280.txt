 I'm not sure what it is about Miyazaki films but for some reason a 21 year old here feels like an 8 year old again. I'm not saying this movie is just for kids or anything but I would highly recommend the movie for any parents out there. Now I went and watched the movie without knowing anything about it and sure i was a bit unsure of the movie at first but Miyazaki won out in the end. Technically the movie is pretty good, the voice overs are pretty decent. If you are one of those people that couldn't stand say dakota fanning and her sister in "My Neighbor Totorro" you have nothing to worry about. I got to give props to Billy Crystal, he does a great job. I really don't know what else to tell you, by now you should just buy it already especially if you are already a Miyazaki fan. If not this one would be a great one to see first. I'd also recommend Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service
