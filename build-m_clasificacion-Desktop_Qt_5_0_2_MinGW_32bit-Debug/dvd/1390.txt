 Don't look here for a horror movie my friends because you won't find it. Oh, "House" starts off well enough and the old lady's suicide creates an ominous tone and just when you think it might be a scary movie, it turns into a joke. What you essentially have in the movie "House" is a dark comedy bordering on just downright comedy. There is pretty much ZERO horror in this flick and when the villain is actually revealed to the audience, you just have to laugh out loud because it is meant to be funny. If you like dark humor with just a taste of horror then this is really right up your alley...if you want a pure horror movie that will produce genuine scares, forget it because you won't get it with this movie. Incidentally and yet very sadly, this movie produced a pathetic sequel called "House II" that is just plain crass, stupid and mindless humor...it is so bad that I will not even write a review on that garbage
