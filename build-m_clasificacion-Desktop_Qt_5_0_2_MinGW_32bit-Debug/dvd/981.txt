 Although the author denies any connection between this book and the Clintons, it is quite obvious after reading it that the book is based 100% on the Clintons. Right down to Bill's indescretions with the ladies and the way 'he' approaches everything. Of course, the characters are renamed and there are a few more colorful characters thrown in to spice their life up even more. I also watched the movie version of the book and that really screamed out 'Clintons'. I have no idea why the author couldn't write a book about their actual lives. Maybe he smelled 'lawsuit'. Either way, this book follows the characters throught an election bid and the trials and tribulations that occurs mainly due to the runners life upsets. A 'lady' steps forward with tapes of the 'president' talking dirty to her on the telephone (sound familiar)? He also sleeps with a young girl of a friend. Not an intern but on the same kind of line. I do fully recommend this book and the movie too. In the movie, a plumped up John Travolta plays 'Clinton' and what a wonderful job he does. See for yourselves
