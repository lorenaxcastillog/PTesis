 Despite it's general outrageousness, Independence Day IS a good movie. Bit of trivia for you: the French think it's ridiculous....because it's sooo "american". Quite so. But that doesn't stop it from being fun (there are good lines)...the actors' preformances are on the whole good... Roland Emerich delivers good material as usual ("I Robot" and "The Day After Tomorrow")... Fine the story is a bit "cockamany," but so what? We all need a bit of escapism in our lives, and Independence Day devilers on that. Not to mention it's patriotic undertones... Doesn't the President's speech just galavnize you? Makes me wish the White House would employ screenwriters to write the President's speches...especially now. Oh, by the way...my family and I have watched this film EVERY 4th of July for the past 7 years. Sounds corney, I know, but it beats "Born on the 4th of July" And we get some fun out of it...since we don't have a stars and stripes to wave out the window
