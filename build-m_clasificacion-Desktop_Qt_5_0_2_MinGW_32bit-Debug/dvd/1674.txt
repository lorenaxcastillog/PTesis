 The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times. So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant. What a disappointment! The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy. There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "Do you believe in Ghosts?" The "lighter" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling. Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D. Yet "The Polar Express" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.
