 Bend It Like Beckham was a very enjoyable movie to watch. It was inspirational and heart-warming for young girls with a dream in showing that you can be anything that you want if you work hard enough. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was great in the role of the coach. Parminder Nagra showed a wide range in her acting abilities, considering this is one of her first films. Keira Knightley sparkled in her role as a tomboy with a homophobic mother, bringing just the right amount of humor to the film. It was an all around sweet, yet touching film examining the influence of culture in a young girl's life. The film poked fun at the proper life of a young Indian girl growing up in a traditional household without getting too serious. The costumes were rich in color and the soccer scenes were well filmed without looking fake. All around, Bend It Like Beckham was an enjoyable and sweet romantic comedy. It's definitely worth the watch.
