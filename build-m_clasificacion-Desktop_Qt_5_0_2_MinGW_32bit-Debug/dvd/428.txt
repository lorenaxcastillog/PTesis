 This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills. It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner. The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery. The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script: Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1: ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts) "Evil Corporation"? Why are you being redundant? The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great. Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance. I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it
