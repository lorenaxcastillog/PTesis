 Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life
