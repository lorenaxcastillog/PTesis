 Warren Beatty raps out the best work of his career both in front of the camera as Senator Jay Bulworth, and behind it as the film's director. Bulworth is hilarious, politically incorrect, and tells truths that come in the form of shocking interviews, and also in the form of a manic white-rapper phase that delivers his message. Halle Berry is at her hottest, most mysterious and intriguing, the streetwise kids in the ghetto almost steal the show, and a jumping soundtrack pops the movie right off the screen. There are a few movies that display so much insider acumen, "Wag the Dog," "Primary Colors," and "Thank You For Smoking" come immediately to mind. Bulworth is in an elite satirical league that could include "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," but to be more accurate it is in a tradition dating back several centuries that includes greats like Swift, Voltaire, Shaw, and even George Orwell.
