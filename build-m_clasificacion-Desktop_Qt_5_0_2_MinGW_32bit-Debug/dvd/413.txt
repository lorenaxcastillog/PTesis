 Strangers with Candy (the movie) is pretty funny. In fact, it is funnier than most major comedy releases but maybe not as funny as the TV series that spawned it. Problem is the same as for X-Files (the movie), rather than changing the game plan (Coneheads) for the new arena they went with their usual formula that gets watered down on the big screen. That being said, in my worthless opinion, Amy Sedaris is the funniest woman in the world and it was wonderful and wonderfully funny to see so many of the original members reunited. One other problem may have been that on the series they would set-up several shots to tell a joke and didn't have that liberty in the movie, as it cost so much more. Another may have been with Paul Dinello directing the movie he shortchanged his role as Jellineck. Still, Strangers will be hysterical for any ardent fan but not sure it's the best introduction for a newcomer as Strangers with Candy, like a fine wine, is an acquired taste.
