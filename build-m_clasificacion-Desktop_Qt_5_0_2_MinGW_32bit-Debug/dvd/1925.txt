 I recently attended the premiere in New York City of Game 6 and was frankly surpised and amazed by what I saw. To me, Micheal Keaton is Batman, Bebe Neuwirth was Lilith, Robert Downey Jr., is well, Robert Downey Jr. What I watched was an amazing story from the master story teller, Don DeLillo, that was full of character, sub plots and great dialog. Keaton, as Ebert and Rober said, gave the first Oscar worthy performance of 2006. His character is torn between his passion for his play that tells the story of his family which opens that evening and watching his beloved Red Soxs in the sixth game of the World Series. This is not a baseball film, nor is it a theater film. This is a film about people. For anyone that wants to see strong performances deliver great lines under wonderful direction from Michael Hoffman, I highly recommend this film
