 George C. Scott is magnificent as George S. Patton! Although the movie has some inaccuracies- some of them showing Patton in a less than favourable light- Scott manages somehow to successfully raise the character above them and make us care for, admire and respect the old general, who was in fact a far superior soldier and a far superior man than those who tried- and those who still try- to belittle or criticize him. George S. Patton said "It is the unconquerable soul of man, not the nature of the weapon he uses, that insures victory", and thanks in great part to Scott's portrayal, we see and feel Patton's soul, the soul of a true warrior, which was much needed them, and, I fear, we still do today. Although it is very likely that he would be treated as unfairly today as he was back then, if not more so. This is a movie worth wachting for many reasons. It may not be precisely a History lesson, but it is certainly is good lesson on what it takes to be a soldier and what it takes to be a man.
