 Very funny, I love the ol' classic screwball comedies where everyone is screaming hysterically, running madly and falling all over each other. Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe, played with psychotic brilliance by John Barrymore, is a hyperactive megalomaniac stage director who after discovering Carole Lombard and making her into a gigantic star smothers her with his controlling nature until she finally has enough and leaves for Hollywood. After she leaves he has nothing but flops until he's in danger of loosing his theater, so in one desperate last ditch effort he tries to get Lombard back. How neither Howard Hawks nor John Barrymore got an Oscar nomination for this movie is a mystery to me. D: Howard Hawks (RIO BRAVO, BRINGING UP BABY) Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe - John Barrymore (GRAND HOTEL, DINER AT EIGHT) Lily Garland - Carole Lombard (MY MAN GODFREY, TO BE OR NOT TO BE) Oliver Webb - Walter Connolly (IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, LIBELED LADY) Owen O'Malley - Roscoe Karns (THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) Max Jacobs - Charles Lane (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE) Mathew J. Clark - Etienne Girardot (THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME '39)
