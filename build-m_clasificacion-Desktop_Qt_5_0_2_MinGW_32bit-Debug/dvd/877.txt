 I stubbornly resisted this movie because its topic about homosexuality, and will admit I was baiased against it for only that reason. When I finally watched it (from a purely paralegal point of view) I was amazed at the sensitivity given the issue at hand: not necessarily homosexuality, but having AIDS, and the bias our society still has for such issues, even in 2005. (And sorry that I allowed my predujiced feelings to get in the way.) It is a case like this - real or imagined - that validates the legal system. A great wrong was comitted against Mr. Beckett, and he fought back, and WON. The relationship between Andy & Miguel was handled tastefully and tactfully, and wasn't offensive to me at all. I was especially grateful to see how supportive Andy's family was for him during this horrible time in his life. I very highly recommend this movie for the "historical" value that is has: not only putting a "face" to AIDS and homosexuality, but for bringing awareness to the subject.
