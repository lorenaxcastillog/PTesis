 Quite coincidentally, this movie was on television last night, right after I broke up with my boyfriend and he left. We broke up because he doesn't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children, only to enter into my family (consisting of my little boy and me), and take on head of household, parental responsibilities again. While I was single a long time until I married (at the age of 38) he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly self-centered. He wants that time now. So he left. Unlike this movie, he doesn't walk the streets like Billy Crystal, thinking how great it is to be alone and, allegedly, a free spirit, only to "see the light" and come racing to his girlfriend to tell he that he loves her, and "when you love somebody, you want your relationship to start right now"! No, in my case, he left and he hasn't called (even though I asked him not to), and I'm fairly certain he is not coming back. Very sad. But a great movie
