 I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories. I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film). Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series. Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs. What's that all about? Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills? Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years! Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise. But....that logo is really annoying
