 This light romantic comedy could be described as a chick flick for those a bit older and wiser than the target audience for most current Hollywood movies in this genre. Like its predecessor "Shirley Valentine," it follows a married woman as she escapes a housewife's life and finds another more to her liking. So marginal in her own family that she gets left behind at a tour bus stop, and acting on a combination of impulses, she takes a vacation on her own in that most romantic of cities, Venice, and meets there (among a comical assortment of characters) a man who steals her heart. The leisurely pace of the story and the gently comic humor are just right. Difficulties are eventually resolved without great effort, sometimes in unpredictable ways, and you relax into a feel-good world where kindred spirits meet and live happily ever after. Goes well with a bottle of Italian wine - shared, of course
