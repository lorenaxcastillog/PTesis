 Like one of the other reviewers said I too was a bit hesitant in seeing this. I had, up to that point, seen only Kurosawa's samurai based films, but then I saw Stray Dog and was sold on the fact that the man truly was a master of not just samurai films, but cinema, as an art form, in general. I've not seen this film in about 8 months, so it's not exactly fresh in my mind, but there are two things from this film that will always stick with me until my dying day: -The final shot of the film, of the criminal behind the glass. This was so haunting, so effective that to this day the thought of it sends shivers down my spine. If this was Kurosawa's intention or not, I don't know. -The first, I think, 45-50 minutes, are based solely in Mifune's apartment. The fact that you can stay in one spot for that length of time and still keep an audience's interest just goes to show the directorial and acting brilliance that Mifune and Kurosawa are so widely reguarded for
