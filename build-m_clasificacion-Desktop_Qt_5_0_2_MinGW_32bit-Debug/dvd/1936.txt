 Did Klaus von Bulow (played by Jeremy Irons) inject his wife Sunny (Glenn Close) with insulin to cause her to fall into a coma or not? Originally convicted, this is about the appeal case that reversed that decision. Close narrates the film from her coma state, and Ron Silver plays the hot-shot lawyer Alan Dershowitz with non-stop energy. The movie is very spirited and captivating and although it revolves around a legal case, it's not really a courtroom drama since very little of it accurs in court; instead we see Silver's aides scurrying around like chipmunks gathering their appeal case data. Of course, the weight of the movie lies on Irons, a rather cold, mysterious man who may or may not be telling the truth. Legally he gets off, but we're left with the impression that morally he may be guilty. The movie is compelling as we're watching, but, strangely, I found the images and scenes from the movie quickly evaporating after it was over: it had no lasting power. Irons won an Oscar for his role
