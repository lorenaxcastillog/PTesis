 Andrew Jarecki intended to make a documentary on David Friedman, "New York's Number One Birthday Clown." What Jarecki uncovered, however, was the sad, secret, mysterious tale of David's father and youngest brother. To their friends and neighbors in Great Neck, an affluent New York suburb, the Friedmans were a model family-until one Thanksgiving Day when Arnold Friedman, a former musician and award-winning teacher, and his youngest son, Jesse, were accused of child molestation. The resulting investigation and trial exposed a bizarre criminal case where the facts were neither as simple nor as clear-cut as they initially seemed. The Friedmans compulsively filmed and videotaped themselves during happy times, and, strangely, this practice wasn't curtailed after the arrests. Much of CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS consists of this family footage, and while you have to question their rationale behind shooting these intimate moments, there's no denying that they're what give this documentary its emotional power. What is the nature of truth? CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS will make you ponder that question long after you've seen it. A bizarre, disturbing, and compelling experience
