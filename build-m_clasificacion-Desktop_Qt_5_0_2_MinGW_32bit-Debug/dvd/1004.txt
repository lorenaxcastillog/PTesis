 How do you show a millionaire playboy, swooping in by plane to pick up a socialite Hollywood actress and make it look like a coming of age story? When he shared his milk with her, it was so romantic, I didn't know what I was going to do. Also, has that recording of that Bach fugue ever been put to better use than it was in the Hell's Angels filming scene? I'm such a *fan* of Scorsese that I could see taking my remarks about him with a grain of salt, but honestly, no one else could possibly be as good at adding music to a film. Also, everyone's acting was just great. Alan Alda playing the mean guy...Alec Baldwin was great... I knew Jude Law was Errol Flynn even before he was introduced... Kate Blanchett was of course wonderful... I'm so glad that Scorsese has decided Leonardo DiCaprio is his new favorite actor. They make such a good team -- Dicaprio was great in this.
