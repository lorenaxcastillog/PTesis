 I was extremely surprised that tap is not released on DVD. In fact it sucks that there is no DVD release. My name is Chris Richardson and Tap is one of my favorite movies. I am 25 years old and I still whatch this movie and I will never get sick of this movie. I am in the US Navy and I have no VCR, I only have a DVD player. I saw the movie on TV the other day and I need to own this movie but with it not released on DVD I can't and that sucks. Tap was a story of the life of a lot of tap dancers in the late 80's and even into the early 90's. The struggle of old and new tap dancers. This movie showed the world that tap dancing was in the process of changing with the times and young tap dancers were starting a whole new form of tap dancing, a new generation of tap dancers were mixing todays music with a new style of tap dancing and this movie helped to change the way that people thought of tap dancing. Please release this movie on DVD really soon.
