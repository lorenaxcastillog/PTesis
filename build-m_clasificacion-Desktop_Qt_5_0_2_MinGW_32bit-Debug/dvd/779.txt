 Drive Well, Sleep Carefully is visually interesting with great tunes and tons of live footage. For those who are looking for a "live" dvd with uncut performances, this dvd is not for you. The whole disc feels more like a documentary than a live and uncut sort of disc. That's not entirely a bad thing, because voice overs add to the overall artistic feel of the disc. It seems like some people have given this dvd a lot of negative feedback because the members of Deatcab come off as whiny occasionally;however, it seems that many reviews that give negative feedback do not take into consideration that being a "rockstar" is a difficult job. Frankly, Deathcab is rather honest in many parts of the film, and Drive Well, Sleep Carefully shows a dimension of touring that a lot of music fans do not see. Overall, this disc is worth adding to a disc collection for non-Deatcab and Deathcab fans alike.
