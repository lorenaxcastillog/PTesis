 When &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; was released eight years ago, I ended up watching it in the theater because I was bored and because it looked a little more promising than the rest of the pack. That thought proved to be an understatement. To date, I have seen this movie at least eight times, and I tend to enjoy it more with each viewing. Nicholas Cage is perfect as the disgruntled Secret Service agent who feels he has been banished to his current duty -- namely, doting on a cantankerous former First Lady, played to the hilt by Shirley MacLaine. &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is alternately funny and moving, and even includes a bit of a mystery for Cage to solve. Far more than a one-dimensional film, &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is satisfying for so many reasons -- the witty script, the fine performances, the deft direction, and the mostly even pacing, to name a few. While you can catch this on a regular basis on TBS (which has made the movie one of its most reliable staples), &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is definitely worth owning for more frequent viewing
