 1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B&W so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!!
