 Michele and Fillippo, the two little boys who are rescuer and victim respectively, may not have been scared as they each demonstrate unique courage and rapidly growing friendship when confronted with an ongoing terrible situation, but as a parent, I sure was. The obvious reason is for the kidnapped child, pale and almost savage from his captivity beneath ground, while his mother pleads for his life on national television in Italy. But the more subtle cause is for what happens to Michele, ten years old in one sun-drenched summer in southern Italy, as he gradually comes to realize that none of the adults in his small remote village are to be trusted. This loss of innocence is as painful to watch as his own humanity and courage are stirring. His solitary stand against adult perfidy leads the film to its tense finale as the two boys inspire each other to separate acts of bravery at great personal peril. Taut from start to finish, I'm Not Scared is a masterful work throughout.
