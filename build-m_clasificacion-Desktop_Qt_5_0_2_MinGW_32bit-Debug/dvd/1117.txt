 This is truly the first great volume of the series. There are other good ones, but no other volume struck my fancy like this one did. Every episode is jam-packed with action and great story line. Ready to take you for a ride. Misguided Miscreants 1 & 2 - The first episode on the disc. We step into Mugen's past, and see who he really is, and how/where he grew up. This episode and its follow up are amazing episodes with great action, and top notch soundtrack. Amazing finale, as well. Bogus Booty - The trio find great, stashed wealth with intension to spend. This is the most hilarious episode of the series, and not to mention one of the coolest. The most rewatchable on the disc. Lullabies of the lost verse 1 - The party splits ways, and find theirselves troubled. For troubles never singly come. Great episode, with an even greater follow up
