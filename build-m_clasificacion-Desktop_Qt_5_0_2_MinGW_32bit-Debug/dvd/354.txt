 I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip&hop music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film
