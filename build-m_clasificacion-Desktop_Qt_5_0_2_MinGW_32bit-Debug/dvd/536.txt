 I believe that maybe not "everything" is ideal for the dog, but those methods are really working. And they don't in any way threaten the dog. He just learns his place with not violence or yealing. Use the leash, make a little sound, touch the back of the dog...Where is the violence in this? More than that, I've read many different books and articles lately from various authors, species specific or general and those books confirm me a lot that there is a great logic behind his methods. Of course he offers a "school" of thinking about the psychology and the way of the dog. Others may consider them to be "out of date" or bad or whatever. "Specialist" often defend ONLY the way of thinking they think is better...wrong I think. For me I'd say, try them, try others and see for yourself. For this one in particular I don't see how a dog would feel anxious, angry, fearful or very sad in the end. He will respect his owner and follow him in his life. The owner will continue to give him affection and care. Some kind of perfect relationship
