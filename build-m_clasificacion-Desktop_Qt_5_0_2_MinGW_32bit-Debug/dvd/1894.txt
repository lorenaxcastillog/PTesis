 When I saw previews for this movie, I thought to myself man I want to go see this movie. I never did though go to the movies to see it. I finally rented it though and I wasn't disappointed one bit. The action is off the chain, the plot is pulsating, and Seagal is his typical bad ass self. There were other good performances in this movie as well. DMX is equal to Seagal in the bad ass department, Isaiah Washington shows off his versatility as the cop teamed with Seagal, and Michael Jai White is very convincing as the devil cop Louis Strutt. The best part in the movie is when Boyd (Seagal) fights Strutt while Rollins (DMX) fights Bontini. If you're a movie fan who likes over-dramatized Oscar movie dribble, then this movie isn't for you. If you like an entertaining plot with pizazz and style, then this movie is right up your alley!
