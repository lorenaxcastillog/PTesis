 I'm 15 years behind most of you, but I've seen it now. It's wonderful. Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. This film covers 15 or 20 years in the life of Miss Daisy, beginning with her wrecking the car. Her son hires a chauffeur against her wishes. Etc. Dan Ackroyd shows us that he can act. After GHOSTBUSTERS and BLUES BROTHERS I had my doubts. This deceptively simple story works because Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy are so skilled. I think Freeman was more deserving of an Oscar than Tandy, but I'm not knocking her win when I say that. Set in the South, starting in the early 1950s, and as a Southerner myself I particularly enjoyed the authentic dialogue. It covered some "heavy issues" with a light touch, but that's because it wasn't about those issues. It was about its characters. And hey, we know the issues already. This is simply a wonderful film. I'll watch it again. It's rare for "critical acclaim" to equal "Mikey likes it," but it happened this time.
