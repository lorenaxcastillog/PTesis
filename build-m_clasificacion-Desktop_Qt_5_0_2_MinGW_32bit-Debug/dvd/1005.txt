 History is created by the telling of stories of the past and so many times those stories get changed and enhanced by those storytellers. BUT...in this case, this documentary of a day that changed our nation is priceless from a historical perspective. This video is the real video footage taken totally by chance. And every inch of film was done with total respect for those that lost their lives that day. And it is an amazing look at the brave firefighters that support each of us every day in a quiet loving way. Their love and dedication to their job, without regard for their own safety is amazing. Doesn't mean they don't get scared...just means that they care enough about others to give their life to save someone. If you never want to forget...and you want the REAL story...and you want to see real courage then you should buy this DVD
