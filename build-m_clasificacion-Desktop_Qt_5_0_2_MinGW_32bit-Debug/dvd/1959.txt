 I read all of the reviews presented and purchased the video based on those reviews. Unfortunately, I must say that our family was very disappointed with the video. It claims to be made by a Christian company (not certain) called Reasons to Believe but in the first 30 minutes of viewing the film, there is no mention of God and the subject matter tends to lead the viewer away from the Biblical creation. The statements made by Dr. Hugh Ross are not even close to being Biblical. Everything mentioned went against the Bible's creation. For any Christian thinking about purchasing this film, I would not recommend it. I would, though, highly recommend the Moody &quot;Journey to the Edge of Creation&quot; videos. There are two in the series, &quot;Our Solar System&quot; and &quot;The Milky Way &amp; Beyond.&quot; The photography is fantastic and the message is clear...our universe is made on a grand design. Only the Master Planner, God Himself, could have created it with such precision and loving care. Please do not be deceived by this video, &quot;Journey Toward Creation.&quot; &quot;Creation&quot; should not even be a part of it's title. Maybe a more proper title would be...&quot;Journey Toward Deception.&quot
