 This comedy is highly recommended. Air Force Lt.Col. John Burton (Cary Elwes) has just been assigned by the Pentagon as a weapons procurement officer in charge of signing off for the U.S.Army's Bradley fighting vehicle. His new commanding officer is Army Major General Partridge (Kelsey Grammar). This program of inter-service teamwork has been appropriated by congress to oversee misuse, abuse, and other non-worthy military projects by the various military services. Only Lieutenant-Colonel Burton refuses to sign off on this dangerous and worthless fighting vehicle. Moreover, when he investigates the background of the vehicle he discovers that the Bradley fighting vehicle has morphed into just about everything--except what it was initially designed to function as. Therefore, things go bad for him when he butt's heads with his commanding officer, Major General Partridge. Gen. Partridge has invested his time and energy to see that no matter what, the Bradley is to go into production. Richard Benjamin directed and stars in this excellent, and dark comedy. The entire film is great, and is highly recommended!
