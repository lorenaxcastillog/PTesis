 Documentary on the destruction of Flint, MI, with the closing of GM plants there and the laying off of 30,000 workers. Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless
