 Great movie, Being from a lil place not terribly east of Perry County, the place where the movie was filmed, is sorta my old stomping grounds. Its a lost thing almost in this world but, when you get in the back woods of the Appalachian mountains, people sorta stick together, and still watch over one another. Anyway.. about the snake bus being "over the top" mentioned in an earlier review. That bus exists, it used to visit the Paintsville Apple Festival every year, and he used to bring it to my gradeschool regularly for education about the snakes. Mind you the tanks were better situated than in the movie, and well taken care of. Most of the snakes in the real bus were quite venemous as well. Regardless, the bus in the movie, bit for bit, is an exact replica of the old snake bus. IIRC the snake man was from Hazard, Ky *which has no relation to the dukes of hazzard which was georgia*and took it to Hillbilly Days in Pikeville as well... anyway just my 2c and a little background to the movie.
