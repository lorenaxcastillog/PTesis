 Yes, the commercials are crass, but once you get past that this DVD is one of the best especially for older infants. I started showing my son Baby Bach and Baby Mozart around 3 months (along with a few others, but I think those two are thest best for young infants.) Around 4 months I wanted to introduce my son to a little more mature viewing. Monet is recommended for 6 months and above, and it was around 5 months that this became his absolute favorite. At 9 months now, this DVD is still his favorite. The puppets are incredibly cute and funny, the music is pretty good, and the visuals are stunning. It is my favorite to watch also!! I would HIGHLY recommend this to slightly older babies. Baby McDonald is okay, but I am still waiting for Baby Neptune to grab his attention. For babies under 5 months, I think Bach and Mozart are the best.
