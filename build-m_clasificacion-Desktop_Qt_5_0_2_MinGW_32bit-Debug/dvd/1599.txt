 Errol Flynn, who has always been one of my personal favorite actors all my life, plays a stellar perfomance as the swashbuckling hero, Robin Hood. Each character in the movie is brilliantly acted and the fighting scenes quite believable. You all know the story, so I won't go into detail about it. The second disc contains a lot of information that the average person doesn't know. Such as James Cagney was origianlly picked to star as Robin Hood but had a fight with the bosses and walked off the lot. There's also a short about one of the masters of the bow, Howard Hill. A couple Merrie Melodies cartoons starring Buggs and Daffy. And best of all, a behind the scenes look at the stars who made up the extraordinary cast. For those of us who grew up on such fare, this is a must have. If you're expecting it to be dark and gritty like the version starring Kevin Costner, you will be disappointed
