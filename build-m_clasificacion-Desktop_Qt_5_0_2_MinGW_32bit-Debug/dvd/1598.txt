 Cheerfully blending a gee-golly, "let's put on a show" sweetness with a brazenly filthy sense of humor, "Mr. Show" is arguably the funniest and most original sketch comedy show since Monty Python. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross lead a talented cast -- and guest stars like Jack Black and Sarah Silverman -- through increasingly loony sketches that seamlessly blend into one another, stream-of-consciousness style. You could call it "mashup comedy," as much of the series' hilarious punch comes from fusing two disparate elements -- the Pope and the O.J. Simpson trial, for example -- into one bizarre whole. Highlights include the folksy proprietors of a Mom-and-Pop porn shop; an infomercial for pans which rapidly becomes a twisted psychological nightmare; Jack Black in a slacker pardoy of "Jesus Christ Superstar"; America's quest to blow up the moon; a group of mobsters arguing over what the biggest number is; and a Jerry Springer-like talk show set on a life raft adrift in the ocean. "Mr. Show's" definitely not for everyone, but if you've got adventurous tastes in comedy, you're all but certain to love it
