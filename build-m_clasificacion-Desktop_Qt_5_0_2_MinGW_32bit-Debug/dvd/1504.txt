 you will be amazed at Paul's ability and dedication to learning the tuvan language, despite extremely limited resources (being blind, and having to translate from english to russian, and then from russian to tuvan! it was a huge challenge). This is a powerful story told in the spirit of Richard Feynman's life, which was also spontaneous and full of meaning. The tuvan throat singing is simply amazing; I still have no idea how they do it. Paul's live performance in the concert is astounding, especially because he winged the whole thing! If you don't appreciate something this good, I don't know what to say. Just go get it, and see that truth is stranger (and better) than fiction. Also get the soundtrack, especially if you were impressed by the music. And get Paul Pena's New Train cd that recently came out, which is a lost classic that was just released by his record company
