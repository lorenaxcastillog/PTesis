 Both of these workout programs are really good. They are simple to follow, exercise all parts of the upper and lower body, and are over in a flash. I can't tell you how much better I feel after I've done one of these workouts. Sometimes I use these programs for my "off" days, when I feel like I just can't face an hour workout, and I always am happy when I've done them. The key to these videos is really using heavy weights. If you aren't tired by 8-12 reps, as Kathy says, you need to increase the weight. If you use weights that are too light, you won't see the results you want. I've only given them four stars because of a couple of small details. In the first video, I don't think the back exercises (only about 1 minute) are necessary. Most of us have lower backs that are too strong; the problem is our abs. On the second workout, I hate the abs section. I just cannot stand pilates, so I just do the abs section for the first video or make up my own. Overall, though, these are excellent value workouts.
