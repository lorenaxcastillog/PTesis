 In the instructor catagory, Keli is in my top 3. I have done many of her workouts and when I needed to lose weight, I did via her dvds. Even now, I still do this workout every now and then to boost my metabolism again, because it's tough but so effective and fun. In this, there are aerobic/toning intervals for a little under 40 minutes (the most effective way to burn fat and calories) and then there is body sculpting. It is tough, but so worth while. She is very motivating yet has a no-nonsense method. The choreography is great and makes it fun. It is an advanced workout, so don't jump right into this if you haven't worked out for a while. When I first got this about 3 years ago, I couldn't do much of it at all, but by doing it in parts over time, and other easier workouts, I got there and it's worth it to keep trying. You won't be disappointed
