 Unfortunatly southpark above seison 4 is not availlable in Holland on DVD. So everytime a new season is released I rush to have it shipped from abroad. This season was really worth the waiting, again. As always the makers of Southpark succeed to brilliantly mock society, recent events and stereotype the American way of life. "Beef" between a south park dancing crew and the boys, the man-child Michael Jackson with a child on his own moves into Soutpark, people coming in from the future to work who somehow make you wonder what that reminds you of, the unevitable and hypnotising attraction of Wall-mart, the quest for ratings of rivalling TV shows , Paris Hilton with her own Stupid Spoiled whore product and al always many, many of Cartmans brilliant, ignorant, blunt, shameless, rude, spoiled , respectless behaviour. To put it short : hilarious. But be careful! Don't watch this if a naked Cartman might upset you
