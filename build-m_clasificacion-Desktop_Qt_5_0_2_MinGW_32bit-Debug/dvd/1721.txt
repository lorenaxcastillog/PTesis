 i knew it would be hard getting back into shape after my baby, BUT with this dvd it was EASY! Leisa Hart is excellent at giving short and simple cues to help you follow her routines, and i absolutely LOVE IT! The choreography is simple and not overly challenging, it is great for a beginner or someone who is in decent shape. I was definitely overwieght and out of shape when i got starte two months after having my baby, i only wish i had done her Fitmama Prenatal video and got started sooner because I was so out of shape after not working out for 3-4 years that it was a struggle to get motivated on my own, but when i started doing leisa's dvd it made me feel capable of getting into shape, slowly but surely. I am in no rush since i took so much time off, but i do feel some results and it is because of the instruction led by leisa hart. I really like her workouts and enjoyed losing my baby weight with this dvd
