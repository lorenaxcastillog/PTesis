 I think "Best Years" is now terribly dated, and it has always been overlong, but there are great performances here, especially Harold Russell's portrayal of Homer, the double-amputee, who must return from WWII with artificial hands. Set in a large, fictional, midwestern city, the film tracks the troubles of three veterans as they return to civilian life. Russell is so impressive because he was the real thing...a non-actor amputee vet. The movie is worth seeing for him alone. The Hollywood pros, of course, do good jobs in their roles as well. If your parents or grandparents were young adults in the post-war 1940's, this film will help you understand their experiences. It is fascinating, too, for the cars, the airplanes, the jobs, the courtship rules, and the relation of young adult vets to their parents or partners after years of separation. I think every adult citizen should see it at least once. We have wounded vets returning from war experiences every day in the USA in 2006, and while the nature of work and relationships have changed tremendously in the past 60 years, the fears and joys and hopes and challenges are largely the same
