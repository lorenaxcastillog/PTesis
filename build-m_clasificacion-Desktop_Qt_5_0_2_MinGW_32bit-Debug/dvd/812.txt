 After reading the reviews, I decided to order it. I wasnt looking for something vigorous, just something to involve my 2 year old toddler while getting a decent workout. It was really fun, my son had a blast. Of course, it took him a few minutes "get" it but eventually he started playing along. The workout itself is fairly easy if you do it without the baby, but if you do it WITH.. its a pretty good session. I used my 2 year old (33lbs) on as many as I could and I worked up a damn good sweat. The only thing that is annoying is that one of the girls talks over the whole time about this and that... but I just tuned her out. If you can get over the cheesy quality of the video and dont take this as a real serious, get down and dirty workout, then I think you'll be really pleased with this
