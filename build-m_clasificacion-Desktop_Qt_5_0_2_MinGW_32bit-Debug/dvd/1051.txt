 Any movie about Ray Charles is guaranteed to have a fantastic soundtrack. What else? First of all, Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. He was a pleasure to watch. Next, since we have childhood flashbacks, we must have a credible young actor. We do. The kid's great. Next, the story. Yep, we've got that. No sugar coating of the lows and an excellent job of sharing the highs. It's a fine, fine movie. It focused on the early years, before rehab, and probably simplified some things to fit into only 2.5 hours. So, not perfect. But very good. Well worth watching. Possibly the funniest moment is this. White kids on the beach trying to sing the orgasmic call-and-response of "What'd I Say" as if it were something from a Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello movie. Hilarious. DVD bonus features include a jam session between Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx. Unfortunately, that didn't work on my Chinese version. I hear Foxx is a talented musician himself, and that he showed this to the Grammy audience recently. I'm not surprised.
