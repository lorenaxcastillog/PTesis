 In 1967 when Hal Holbrook portrayed Mark Twain in the CBS TV special, "Mark Twain Tonight" I thought Samuel Clemens' death had again been mistaken. Holbrook's impersonation of Twain was so real I couldn't help but think he was still amongst us. Naturally when I discovered the telecast was captured on DVD I knew I just had to see it again. And guess what? Mark Twain hasn't aged a day over 70. He still looks and sounds just as good as he did then. Holbrook segues one passage after another from Twain's writings ("Roughing It", "Huckleberry Finn", "The Golden Arm" and others) as though telling us the story of his life. Of course, if you want to play specific sections from the show, the DVD is indexed for your personal preference. Whether you listen to Holbrook's 90-minute monologue uninterrupted or exerts from the show, you'll easily be charmed by Twain's humour and wit until you almost swear it is Twain himself on stage
