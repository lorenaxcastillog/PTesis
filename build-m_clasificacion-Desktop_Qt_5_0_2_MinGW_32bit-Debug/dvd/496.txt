 It's not one of my favorite movies, but Diary of a Mad Black Woman, was worth the time to watch. The use of the male actor playing over the top female and various other family members is really a passe now, and over done, and not nearly as funny as I'm sure it was intended to be. Medea is hilarious, but I personally think "she" would have been a lot funnier if played by a real woman, and not quite so outrageous. I'm not sure I really like the ending of the movie. To me, it just summed things up a bit to easily, and left me wondering exactly want happens to McCarter in the end... I guess he fits in with the family now or something - but where are his kids? Also, I find Orlando's statement about, "I deserve you." to be really silly, after she dumped on him and ran... he actually was a good guy, and he deserved much better. But for a movie, just to kill the time on a lazy Sunday afternoon, it WAS funny, and worth the time to watch it. I laughed pretty hard in some spots
