 Singapore sold the movie/film in videoshops which I've grabbed one which most of these DVD which I get has the white tape on op of the DVD box stating the name of the movie/film and the tape beside saying bbb....security enclosed....hee hee....and this story is not bad which is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film.
