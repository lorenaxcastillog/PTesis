 Based on the actual events that took place in 1985, The FBI Murders chronicles the events leading up to the largest FBI casualties ever suffered at one time in the history of the agency. Two well trained ex Green Beret buddies (played by David Soul & Michael Gross) team up and start robbing armored cars in Florida. Eventually they raise the stakes and start killing people during these robberies. The FBI tails these two and while attempting to arrest both men, one of the worst shoot-outs in law enforcement history ensues. When it's all over, several FBI agents are dead, there are several agents wounded and both suspects are shot and killed. This movie is made-for-tv, but it is still one of the hardest, most intense I've seen on network television. The ruthlesness and violence of these men is not toned down at all as in one scene, David Soul literally walks around looking for the surviving/wounded FBI agents and begins executing them on the ground. Highly recommended for fans of true stories or crime
