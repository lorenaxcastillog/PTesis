 After watching quite a few of these DVds, Cesar Milan etc.., I can see that this is not 'rocket science'...the techniques, once you see them demonstrated, are easy to follow and results are speedily forthcoming...as long as the DVD is hosted by a good communicator..this one is! The secret is repitition of the techniques, dog's are very smart, as you all know, and they soon latch on to the reward system, good = tasty treat, bad = bupkiss, once they are 'grounded'; 'balanced', they assume the role intended for them, obeying ushumans! It is not cruel to 'gently discipline' your dog when he steps out of line, they appreciate and understand it. This DVD is a very good place to start getting your dog back to being a dog, and not the bonkers...lead pullling...disobedient bundle of teeth and fur he might be right now. Be strong...use the DVD to strengthen your resolve when you make your pampered pooch sleep downstairs, and above all....repeat....repeat...repeat the techniques you are shown and Numero Uno rule is not treats for pooches that are just sitting there looking at you with big eyes....they have to earn it!!
