 I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less. I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!
