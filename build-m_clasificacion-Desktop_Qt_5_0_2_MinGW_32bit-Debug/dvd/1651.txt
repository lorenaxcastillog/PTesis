 I love this workout for a number of reasons: 1. Ellen Barrett is excellent at leading the workout. 2. I have avoided traditional Pilates because I really enjoy something with a little more of an aerobic style - this constant moving routine using weights and Pilates inspired moves makes this possible. 3. At the same time, as I get older, I want less "jumpy" style aerobics - this routine also makes this possible. 4. By the end of this routine I have broken out in a full blown sweat. 5. When I first started doing this routine I too thought it was repetitive, however, the more I did it - the stronger I got and now the segments fly by - although still remain challenging - and I actually look forward to this workout. 6. And lastly, using this workout alone for the past 2 months (at least 4x a week - more if my schedule permits) and improving my diet, I have completely toned and reshaped my body. I highly recommend buying this DVD - Just do it!
