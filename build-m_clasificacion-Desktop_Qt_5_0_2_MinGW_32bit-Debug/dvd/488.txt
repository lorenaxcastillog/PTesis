 My son received this DVD as a gift from "Grandmother" 1 week before his 2nd Birthday. Now he is 2 years and 2 weeks old and can recognize EVERY letter in the alphabet AND say the corresponding phonetic sound. I am amazed at how quickly he picked it up. We are a bilingual family (English and Thai/Lao) and thus far in his life he hasn't been extremely "verbal" yet (he walked at 10 months and is great with all the physical stunts, but so far doesn't have a very large vocabulary). I thought this DVD would be something a 2-year-old would need time to "grow into", but it has been great for him. It is proven that the mind can recall information more easily when we learn things in a certain context. For example, the "K" says "kuh", while at the same time doing a "kick" and singing the "K" song. All of these cues, visual, audile, and kinesthetic, help seal the information in your child's memory. As a professional English as a Second Language teacher and a Master's Degree holder, I highly recommend this DVD for preschoolers
