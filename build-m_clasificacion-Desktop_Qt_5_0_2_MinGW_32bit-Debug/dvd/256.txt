 My wife, 4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if you like this, also check out "Wisper of the Heart", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie
