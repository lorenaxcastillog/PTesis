 Everyone thinks this movie is about Anthony Hopkins living out some demented "Gorillas in the Mist" nightmare. That is simply the catalyst for teaching us something about how we relate to the world around us. Everything about this movie is about control, the desire to control those who are not like us, the desire of the guards to control the population, the desire of Gooding's character to contol Hopkins. But, what Hopkins has to teach us is that we are not in control, but we simply hold onto our illusions of control. When our illusions are threatened we become angry and frightened because we are afraid of the reality. Ever wonder why we are so disturbed about a home invasion? Is it because someone came in, or because we had built up an illusion that we were safe, and now that illusion is gone? In this movie look past the gorillas and the corny guards and the predictable plot, look deeper into what the characters reveal about ourselves. Truly, then this is a very frightening movie
