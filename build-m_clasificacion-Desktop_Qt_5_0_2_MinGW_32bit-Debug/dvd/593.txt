 "Munich" is not one of Steven Spielberg's best films,but it is still worth watching due mainly to a brilliant cast.Eric Bana,Geoffrey Rush, and Daniel Craig are especially outstanding.The film also has an impressive physical production and a haunting John Williams score. But there are problems.For one thing,it's too long.That seems to be a problem many directors have today.Why do all of today's big movies have to run nearly three hours?Spielberg could have cut half an hour,and the film would have been much better.But the biggest problem is that Spielberg,Kushner,and Roth have really stacked the deck for Israel here. The story is entirely one-sided.There is an excellent scene where the Arab and Israeli agents confront each other,and the three filmmakers would have been wise to pursue that angle.Instead,no explanation is given to the Arabs'side or to WHY they seized the athletes in the first place.The result is a decidedly unbalalnced story.And the ending is ambiguous.Still, "Munich" is an ambitious film worth watching
