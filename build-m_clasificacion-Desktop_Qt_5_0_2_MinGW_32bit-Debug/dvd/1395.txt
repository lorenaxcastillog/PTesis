 This movie is reminiscent of "In Cold Blood" because of the tragedy of it, and it's "duo" plot line, but is I think a much better rendition of the book, and Woods is outstanding in his role. You really get to where you like, but don't like this guy! You can see how he traps and sucks people in with his charm, but see his totally maniacal side as well. He really is a sick puppy in this! It is a haunting movie that you will have scenes in your head for years, and certain lines will stay with you always if you are a true movie fan. Ted Danson has a really good, if not brief (you'll see what I mean) part in the movie. It really is one that if you like this type of movie fare you will watch this one again and again on a Saturday afternoon curled up on the couch with the dog while your team is getting slaughtered on the gridiron! One that I had to search out as part of my collection! A must see
