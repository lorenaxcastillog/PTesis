 When I first heard of this movie from a friend, they gave it such high acclaim, it made me eager to see it. But they never mentioned it was a low-budget film with comedy. They just mentioned great fight scenes. So when the film began, I was scared at how shakey the camera was. But I gave it the chance it rightfully deserves, and I got a nice mix-up for a movie I was expecting to be simple action. I must say that the one oddity of this film was the whole portals thing they mentioned. The whole thing about 666 portals is rather irrelivant. You just need to know they're at a place called "The Forest of Ressurection" and they were destined to be there. They'll explain why without the whole portals thing. I understand it, don't get me wrong. But, like the cops they occasionally show in the film, it serves no purpose. If you remember this film is low-budget, you'll see how remarkable it really is. It's filled with action, swords, guns, zombies, the whole nine yards. And there's the beauty of a twist in the end
