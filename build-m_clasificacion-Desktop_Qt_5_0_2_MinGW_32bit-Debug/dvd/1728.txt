 Okay, "Philadelphia" what can be said about it ?When i first seen it... I was moved and it made me think-- while watching the opera scene & Tom's funeral and seeing him as a child ( not only those both scenes made the movie) but made me think about "god, he looked so innocent & happy" and how scary it is to grow up in a world so cold & unkind. Also the opera scene gave me goosebumps as Tom hank explain what the arist was talking about...How beautifull and emotional was watching Denzels reaction. Neil young's "philadelphia" is possibly one of the most beautifull song i've ever heard & it realy brought me peace. If you decide to rent "philadelphia" ? Think about what i said and also how truly beautifull Antonio & Hanks relationship was with so much love and how sad was for Antonio "Miguel" knowing that his bestfriend, lover and companion could die at any moment. ::sigh:: Just watch it
