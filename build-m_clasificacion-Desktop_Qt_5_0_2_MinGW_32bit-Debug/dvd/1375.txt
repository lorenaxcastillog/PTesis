 I first saw this movie in the theater,and I came out shaking.It's that creepy.For a movie that is only PG-13&lacks the usual slasher&bloody gore,this is a movie that gets inside your head.(From what I've heard,the original Japanese version is even scarier) Naomi Watts (who is also excellent in the even creepier "Mulholland Drive")plays a single mother who discovers a deadly video.At first,she thinks it's an urban legend,but she digs deeper--and finds bodies.The story depicted on the video takes her through time.She explores it with her boyfriend&her son. This movie is unusual--and even creepy--in its combination of the past&present.The evil girl,Samara,seems to be from the 19th century;her parents dress as if they were Mennonites or Amish,yet they are in the 20th century and take their daughter to a modern-day insane asylum.At first,Samara seems to be an innocent victim,yet she has terrifying effects on everyone around her---and,scariest of all,she never sleeps. Naomi Watts is an excellent actress,turning what could've been a chessy horror flick into a haunting psychological thriller that will stay with you long after you've stopped watching
