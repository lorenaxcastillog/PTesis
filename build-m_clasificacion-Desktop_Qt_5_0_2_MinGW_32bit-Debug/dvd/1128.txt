 Helmut Newton - Frames From the Edge is a video primarily geared towards the ardent fan of photography. However, a person who is interested in the development of 20th century pop culture would certainly be more than amused by this wonderful video. The most striking aspect that shines throughout the video is Helmut's fun loving and sparkling personality. Witty, adventurous and most of all - fun loving - Helmut keeps the viewer informed and amused. Not at all like many photography videos centered in the class room, the range of locales in this video is dazzling. More importantly, the camera follows Helmut during shoots, conducting interviews with potential models, and riding with Helmut in Los Angeles. In the age where technological gadgets seem to proliferate it is telling that Helmut reveals that he uses one or two cameras to conduct his work. In summary, the photography fan would learn a great deal and the pop culture fan would learn why Helmut Newton is an important 20th Century icon. Much like Helmut's personality this video merits five stars
