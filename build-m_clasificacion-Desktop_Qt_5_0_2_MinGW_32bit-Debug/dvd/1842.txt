 I'll be the first to admit, I saw "Jay and Silent Bob" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show. As for the show(s), they were very entertaining. I could definetly see getting into this show on a regular basis, even if it was a little Cheezey
