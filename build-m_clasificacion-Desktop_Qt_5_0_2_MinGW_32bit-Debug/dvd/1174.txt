 I've been listening to Sarah McLachlan for years and I saw this on "VH1" when it originally aired. If you taped Sarah McLachlan on "VH1 Storytellers" when it originally aired like I did and are a devoted fan, this is a must have DVD. The feature performances are for "Good Enough," "Building a Mystery," "Ice Cream," "Sweet Surrender," "Hold On," "Elsewhere," "Possession" "Witness" and "Angel." The last two performances are bonuses which weren't on the original VH1 show. Sarah has a beautiful voice and very powerful words and this was truly an amazing DVD. I was moved by the passion and emotion and the meaning behind the lyrics. This DVD has terrific sound and features flawless live performances. In between songs Sarah talks about some of them and answers questions from the audience. The answers weren't as long as I hoped they'd be, but they did provide good insight into the music - and it is all about the music after all
