 I have been a strong admirer of Fellini's films and my recent purcase of 'Amacord" did not let me down. Set in the 1930's, this film featuring provincial Italy during this period, is full of droll scenes, some of them very funny indeed. Typical of Fellini, this film is a mosaic of fantasy and reality. Italy was in the pre war era of Mussolini and Fellini takes digs of the fascist regime including a hilarious scene featuring a parade. To balance this, there is a brief scene featuring the sinister side of fascism. From a biography written by Tullio Kezich ( a worthwhile read for Fellini admirers) I found that the tiltle comes from 'm'acord', the dialect of Rimini for "I remember'. Rimini is ellini's birthplace and "Amacord" is full of memories of his youth there, presented in his unique style. In 1975, this film won an Osca for best foreign language film. For followers of this genre, I highly recomend "Amacord"
