 This as most of you will know is the story of a half man, half god Hercules but with a unique twist that only Disney can provide for the whole family to enjoy. For the Disney movie Hercules is the born son of Zeus who is kidnapped by the henchmen of Hades lord of the underworld to remove Hercules god powers, making him mortal and then killing Hercules but the henchmen don't do the job properly and instead of killing Herc they just remove his god like immortality but Herc still keeps his god like strength and as a young baby he fights off the henchmen. Because Hercules loses his immortality he is no longer a full god and cannot return to the heavens with his real parents so Hercules is adopted by a family on Earth. The adventure begins from there and i don't wanna spoil anything for you so i'll just say that this is an incredible Disney favourite of mine and that is down to the superb animation, fun script and great music inbetween. Get this movie it is truly great
