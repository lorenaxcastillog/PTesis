 This DVD is the same as the VHS version or very similar. I have seen the VHS version and is almost the same. It lacks more interviews with Larry Bird and it fails to tell what Larry is doing now. It gives a history of his life but i thoutht the NBA could have added more. I have the Bulls dynasty as well and it has more interviews and game by game and I am sure the Jordan DVD has that and more, Larry is in the same league and is a player of the same calibre as Michael. On the plus side it has 3 of Larry Birds best games one where he scores 60 points against the Atlanta Hawks so this is what makes this dvd a great collectors edition more than the footage on his life. Overall I would recommended to people if they want to buy it but for a 25 Anniversary edition I thought the NBA will include more
