 This film is unbelievably good. I DVR'd it on Free Speech TV, and I have watched parts of it again and again. At every turn you will be blown away by the revelations in this film, if you, like me, had never thought much about who controls mainstream media. The first time I watched it I kept having to stop the tape and just cringe, letting the import of the facts sink in. The talking heads are people you may never have encountered, but whom you are unlikely to forget. Write their names down. Check into their books. Even if you don't buy the film look at the list of people in it and get their books. Particularly incisive are the inquiries into the most recent Presidential elections. You were there, I was there, but Lewis shows us the ugly underside that the media can't afford to let us see. This is scary, take-to-the-streets stuff. Finally, Pappas deserves to be more well-known as a documentarian. If you are put off by Michael Moore's whininess and slightly embarassing approach, you may find a new friend in Robert Kane Pappas.
