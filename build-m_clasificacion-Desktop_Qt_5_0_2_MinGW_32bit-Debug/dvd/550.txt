 Someone is always trying to shove it into a musical catagory. Or always tying it in with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but Hedwig and the Angry Inch is in a catagory all it's own. This is an outstanding rock movie that, even if you are uncomfortable with the sort of gay movie genre, you will quickly learn to accept and love because of Steven Trask's excellent writing ability that makes you feel for the characters and respect the music. Seemingly, a satire at first, tells the story of a boy who learns about life, the hard way, through a series of misfortunate things that happen to him and a wacky mother, in East Germany. Eventually after a catastrophic event, he finds himself in America, where life doesn't get any better; all the while searching to find himself, while trying to make his fame and fortune in the music world. If you're not sure, rent it first. I can guarentee you will fall in love with Hedwig, the men and women, and the music he so dearly loves
