 Flightplan is a smart thriller starring Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs) as an architect, who's just become a widow, named Kyle Pratt who boards a two story jumbo jet from Germany back to the States with her 6-year old daughter Julia and a coffin containing the body of her husband (who mysteriously fell from their apartment). She falls asleep and wakes up to find that Julia is missing. Nobody recalls seeing Kyle boarding the plane with a little girl, and there's no record of Julia anywhere. Kyle finds herself in a frustrated ordeal where she is watched over by the flight attendents and an inflight marshal Carson, played brilliantly by Peter Sarsgaard, and will come to realize that she's either crazy or there's a plot against her. I didn't expect much from Flightplan, but the movie succeeds in delivering the thrills and chills, more like an episode of the Twilight Zone, better than most movies of its genre do. Recommended B
