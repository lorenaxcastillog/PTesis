 It amazing to me that for 50 years, this was the Only live-action filming of a Dr Sussus story. I own an old vhs copy of The 5000 Fingers of Dr T. That I found at a resale shop. The movie I have is in blk & wht. But I believe that this disc is in color. So I will be getting this one. Theadore Guisel (Dr. Sussus), was one of the more colorful children's authors of the 20th century. To sum him up, He truly was the Salvador Dali of children's literature. He created a surreal world in his stories just for kids. Where everything and everyone was absurd to the enth degree! Only other childrens author that came close to what Dr. Sussus had accomplished, was the late Maurice Sendak. This was my favorite Dr. Sussus story. But a close second is The 500 Hats of Barthlomew Cubbins. Buy this wonderful movie. For both yourself and the kid in your life. Happy, Happy Fingers!
