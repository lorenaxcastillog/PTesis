 Having seen parts of this film over a span of the last decade or so, without fully seeing all of it, I noticed this DVD on sale at a huge retailer.. (Rhymes with Ball-Mart), for only $4.88, I couldn't resist picking it up to see it all finally. Was it worth it? Yes. I am a straight married guy, and a huge fan of Christan Slater. I have seen damn near every movie with him in it, and Pump was another classic. Did I love everything about this movie? No. It definately reeks of late 80's references and inuendo. I.E. "Bill and Ted" Clones. The story was very well done, however, it contains 2 major flaws. (1) I am a cop, and I know for a fact the Federal Government, would not send the FCC after a lone pirate station who is not screaming for the downfall of government. But is ranting about the local high school administration. (2) I didn't like the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but just say it could have been better. Overall it was a 4 out of 5. Not bad for a film from 1990.
