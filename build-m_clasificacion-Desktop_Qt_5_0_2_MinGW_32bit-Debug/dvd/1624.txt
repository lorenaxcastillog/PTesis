 Worth buying. A lot of good performances. A lot of people you may or not know perform. As far as a celebration of 50 years of the Fender Strat, they should have stayed focused on that a little more. Some of the best where super-picker Albert Lee (with Theresa Andersson) on "Country Boy"....Hank Marvin and Ben Marvin on an old classic, "Sleepwalk"...Paul Rodgers..another classic, "All Right Now"..his "kids" where good too...Jasmine and Steve Rodgers on "Drinking". There are more good ones by Joe Walsh, David Gilmore, Mike Rutherford and others. But it really took a "journeyman" to "bring down the house"...and he did..and best captured what the "Strat" thing was all about. Gary Moore's rendition of Hendrix's "Red House". Played with feeling and a hard edge, he tore it up. I think he was the best of the concert. There's a big mix of different type performormers on this and all said it is worth having. JB, Ohio
