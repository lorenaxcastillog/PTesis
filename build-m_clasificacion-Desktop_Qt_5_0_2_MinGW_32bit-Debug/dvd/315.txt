 In Greenleaf Indiana, something strange is happening. Everyone is turning gay, or so it seems, as a High School teacher is outted at the 68th annual Academy awards, on National television. The most surprised person is the teacher himself who wasn't quite ready for such a bombshell to be dropped. After all, he is getting married....... or is he? A hilarious comedy starring Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Debbie Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck and Bob Newhart. This production is top notch all the way. The all-star cast is fantastic. Joan Cusack gives a stellar performance as the jilted bride. There's not a dull moment and you will be totally enthrolled in the plot right from the start. If you'd rather not see Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline in a hot, steamy kiss, well, get over it. It's hilarious. Terrific acting, great plot, very enjoyable to watch. A great addition to your home video collection. I highly recommend
