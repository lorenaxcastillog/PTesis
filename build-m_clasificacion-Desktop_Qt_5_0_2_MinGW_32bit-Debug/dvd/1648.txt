 This is one of my favorite movies. It's not about any well done special effects or such, it's just one of those films that's really moving. It's funny. Tom Hanks is an excellent Joe. And of course: Meg Ryan. One of her best movies, ever. She's so lovely and beautiful. Also her acting's great, of course. And that story. After watching this, just think about it. Just for one minute. What have you got to loose? I won't say more because some folks out there might see the picture for the first time and I don't want to spoil the experience. Let me just say: I love that movie. Go buy it, watch it, whatever. If you like Meg Ryan or Tom Hanks or if you like romantic comedies, or if you like movies that make you feel free, make you feel better, you don't have to search no more. Enjoy and be inspired ..
