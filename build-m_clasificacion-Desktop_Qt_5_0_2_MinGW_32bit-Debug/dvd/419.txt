 I can't say enough about this movie. It's clearly, one of the most underated movies of the 80's. And sadly it was considered one of his worst movies (along with many others) by pretty much every critic. Umm... ok. It rarely airs and not many people have seen it before. Like the viewer before me said, it needs to be re-released.I've enjoyed this movie on Vhs for years (13 years to be exact) and have finally just gotten it on dvd. With his talent he deserved alot more than he got out of his acting career. In my opinion Hollywood is and always will be overated. Bring back some people who can act!! He's great on his show but I'd love to see him in more main stream movies. And hell, I don't care if they tank I'll watch them anway!! How can you not love Jon's quirky yet enjoyable acting style. And those cute dimples of his !!! (yeah I'm a girl can't help it) Give this movie a chance you'll love it, if you don't something is seriously wrong with you. =) (22 year old viewer)
