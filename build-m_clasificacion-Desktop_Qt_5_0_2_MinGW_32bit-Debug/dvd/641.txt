 this movie was a good stay at home movie to watch with a friend or bf. Gabe the lead character is a musical song writer who goes to a bar and sees a handsome gogo boy dancing on stage, after a few drinks gabe leaves and is on the train on his way home....the gogo boy from the bar(strip joint) walks in and sees gabe and sits down across from him...gabe stares at him up and down. but gabes stop comes up and the gogo boy follows him out...now they both go from place to place trying to find a place to do the deed...but his str8 roomate interrupts, then gabes older friend offers his pad but he bumps into an old flame and now gabe and the gogo boy once again have no place to go....all in all...its a great movie to watch with someone and cuddle...funny and a good watch. enjoy
