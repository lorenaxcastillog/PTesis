 I had previously bought the 1st version. Liked it very much. So I was eagerly looking forward to this latest version. Happy to know that this version has more new Science related information - which was what I was interested in. And for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist, there is a seperate section entirely on Interviews. The best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations. For those who have not seen the 1st version, I think it is alright to watch this. Viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie. The interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer. Everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world, universe and what they are made of. If you had deep question about the reality, you might find an answer in this movie. -- Ravi, Singapor
