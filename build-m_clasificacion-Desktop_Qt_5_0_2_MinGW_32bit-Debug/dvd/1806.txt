 I went into this film knowing nothing about it, and I thought it was one of the best surprises in a long while. The tone is moderately slapstick (Dead Alive) and shows its torso full of gore. For sake of brevity, I won't go into the plot, but will say that some of the best parts of the film are the transitions. They usher along/recap the story by way of acoustic/country music. Some of the transitions are straight forward, while others charge headlong into comedic little diddies. I enjoyed the music so much that I purchased the soundtrack a few days later. Many of the characters are likeable and David Carradine is in the film. What more can you ask? There is gore a plenty and even a dance number. Also, the angle of how the zombies come to be is a fresh one. if you know nothing of this film, you can always give it a rent to see if it's worth a purchase. P.S. you can't go wrong with the unrated version
