 this is sad story about two little angels which r from a very poor familly from iran .they have to strugle whit a huge poverty.their father its having all kind of problems and they have been keeping a little secret from him. they dont want to make him mad . they boy needs to do something and shows his great courage by doing something which almost seems imposible for so many... the reason why i call this review the other glovalisation is because it remind me of the situation in which many kids live in latinoamerica , africa , india and so many other places around the world . but it also reminds me of how great and strong they really are . so i hope u enjoy the movie it is a must have.also a great movie to c whit ur kids and to learn something new about a culture which many of us ignore. another movie that u wiil probably also love is frida by salma hayek one of the greatest mexican actress.
