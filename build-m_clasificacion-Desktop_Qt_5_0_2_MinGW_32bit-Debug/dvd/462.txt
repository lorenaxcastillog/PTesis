 Several other reviewers have put their lists of what these 4 DVD's contained. I won't do the same. I will however share my thoughts of the concerts and why I purchased this concert in its entirity. I watched the beginning of several of the European concerts (London, Paris, Rome) on AOL Broadband and realised the cause of these concerts. It was indeed a day when the world came together with one aim, to listen to good music and tell our world leaders with one loud voice that poverty has to be eradicated. It was a successful day. We were entertained by the best music artists as well as listened to stories from Africa and watched pictures of famine and its effects in Europe. Bob Geldof the producer of these concerts never lost the realisation of what we were here for. July 2nd 2005 stands for all time as the day we spoke with one voice "Let's get rid of Poverty". I purchased this compilation because it was for a good cause and that it had some great music from a few of my favourite bands and solo artists. I recommend this album for any LIVE music fan.
