 Who's idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm? Chris Evans's portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm. Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies? They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters. This movie was somewhat good, but it didn't feel all that great. So far, this movie is just another of Marvel's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher. I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel's chracters go back into hiding. Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story. Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic. Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie
