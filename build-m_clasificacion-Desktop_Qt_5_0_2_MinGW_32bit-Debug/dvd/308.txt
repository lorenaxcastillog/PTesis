 I'm probably one of the biggest fan of the A-Team ever since I was a little kid and would watch the show each day when reruns were on TV. When I started noticing that DVD's were going to be released from various shows, my first thought was that "Oh I can finally get this on DVD!". Well I have picked up the first three seasons so far and although I'm thrilled to have each of the episodes, I'm dissappointed on another level for a number of reasons. Most of the sets out there are filled with bonus features and rare footage..however we get none of that with any of the box sets that have come out so far and I doubt we will. It's not like this show was on for a few months and got cancelled...it ran nearly 100 episodes on NBC! Wouldn't you think there would be something that would enthuse us fans?!? I have some other gripes about it...but I guess I shouldn't be complaining that much. At least it's out on DVD compared to some other shows that have failed to make it to release yet.
