 This DVD is worth it just to watch what goes on in James Taylor face and his eyebrows in an old clip of him singing Steamroller. Whew. Alot going on there. I was delighted to see this tribute to a man whose work ethic continues to make him a delight to experience and hear onstage. I too, was mesmerized with the Dixie Chixs opener, Shower the People. It was smart to have James regular band accompany the artists who contributed to this lovefest, which James, shyly acknowledged. The integrity of his music was upheld by doing so. I was wondering why Ben and Sally Taylor were absent. It would have been great to have them sing a song for their Pop. Obviously the young Taylor twins have Dads's beat and will, hopefully, continue the family tradition as time goes. I had tears in my eyes throughout the concert, but it was Jame's surprise visit to Carole King's, You've Got A Friend, that made my face wet.I am grateful James Taylor is still touring and happy to see such a beautiful tribute paid to a man who more than deserves it
