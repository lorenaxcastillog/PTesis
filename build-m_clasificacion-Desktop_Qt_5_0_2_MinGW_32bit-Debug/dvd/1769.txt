 An outstanding animated comedy, Hoodwinked, brings to the screen a "different" take on the well-known Little Red Riding Hood story. In addition to the "traditional" company of adorable characters from the classic fairy tale, the cherry on the cake has to be the hilarious and hyperactive squirrel. Anne Hathaway, James Belushi, Glenn Close, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs. The film is simple enough, but does a great job of providing high quality entertainment the likes of which we don't get to see often enough. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music are all wonderful! In short, Hoodwinked is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! Strongly recommended along with Shrek and Shrek 2.
