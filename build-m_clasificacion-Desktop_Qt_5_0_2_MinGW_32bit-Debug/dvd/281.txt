 Let me say right away that I enjoyed and appreciated the elements of "Steam Punk" in this film. People who enjoyed "Steam Boy", Neal Stephenson's "The Diamond Age", "The Difference Engine" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, "The Vision of Escaflowne" animï¿½ series, some of the aspects of the "Warcraft" universe and the Australian award winning animated film "The Mysterious Geographical Adventures of Jasper Morello" will enjoy the general "Steam Punk" feel of Howl's Moving Castle. The story of Sophie is very engaging and beguiling. Howl, to some extent, is a side interest in this film, but then, the men always are in Miyazaki films. It is the power and minds of the women which fascinate Miyazaki, not the men. Miyazaki IS the ultimate feminist film maker. Who else would make a film where the central character is a little old lady? I can't wait for "Tales From Earthsea" and the new Miyazaki film!
