 I generally hate rom-coms. Occasionally though, watching two people falling in love and expressing it in a very simple way just gets through and wins my heart. For me, The Edukators works on the same level. It is a film which allows important ideas about the politics in our lives to be conveyed in a very simple way. And I see this as a great strength. Too often, complexity and overanalysis can dull us to a concept we fundamentally believe in and give us the excuse to deny its power. I'd be interested to ask those who complain that the politics here are too stripped down and "text-book" when they actually last heard sypathetic characters with such pure ideology given a voice and the chance to chase down their beliefs in a big screen drama, in front of the world, as opposed to in the campus bar. We don't resist the simplicity of "I love you". Yet what could be more complex than love? I enjoyed the rush of spending time with characters who say "I believe I can change things" and are allowed to have a go at doing just that.
