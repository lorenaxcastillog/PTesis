 Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story), but this is "Boogie Nights". I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic". Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form. What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people. Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works. I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will) Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive. If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it
