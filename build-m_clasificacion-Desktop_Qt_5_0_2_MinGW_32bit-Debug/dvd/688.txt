 I found it amazing that this set has not been brought more obviously to the attention of the American viewing public, at least those of the PBS ilk. I only found it thanks to a recommenation by Netflix (which alone makes that service worthwhile). The HOC trilogy is about a ruthless MP who manipulates the system that he is supposed to serve towards his own ends, to say nothing of the people around him. The trilogy happens to play out in decending order in terms of excellence of the script, the first being easily the best. The bite of the satire is sharpened by the device of having Francis Urquet break through the fourth wall to address the audience, often in front of other characters. Face-framing close-ups are used which accentuates the man's menace. And it works because its so bleakly funny and black. Proof that political cynicism as part and parcel of govenment was fully in flower a long time ago
