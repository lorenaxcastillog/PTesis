 I had to get the new Baby Einstein DVD for my 19 month old daughter. She loves BE and I knew she would enjoy Baby's Favorite Places. Her vocabulary has expanded because of how interactive these videos are for young toddlers and babies. She didn't just stare at the screen blankly. Instead, she was trying to imitate some of the signs for the words and laughed at the puppets. If your child is familiar with BE, don't miss out on this DVD because it's one of their best. It's very much like Baby Wordsworth and has the signs to go with the words. I enjoyed seeing my daughter make connections with what she already knows such as looking outside for our fence as the word fence was introduced. This video is interactive, fun, and is just right for the short attention span of a little one. I have a feeling this will be one of her favorites.
