 This has to be one of my all time favorites, along with "An Affair to Remember" and "The Notebook." Richard Gere is fantastic in this role and as you listen to the commentary on the making of the movie you realize how seriously he took the role. He practiced many hours in order for things to look professional and that translates into superb dancing technique. Stanley Tucci is a hoot in this movie and he as well did a great job dancing. Jennifer Lopez was so interesting to watch and as her character evolved she too transformed in front of our eyes. Susan Sarandon did an excellent job playing the wife of Richard Gere. All in all this was entertaining from beginning to end. The music was inspiring and the ballroom scenes with the quick step and the waltz were my favorites. If you enjoyed watching "Dancing With the Stars", you'll love this movie!
