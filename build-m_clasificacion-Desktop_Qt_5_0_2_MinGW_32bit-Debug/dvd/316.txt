 In my opinion this is one of the best manga series i have ever seen because it's a very good story that mixture samurais with hip-hop culture and it's also very funny. the caracters are very good i think Mugen is the most important, the bad guy, but my favorite is Jin, and i think that he is the most powerfull in my opinion he would win the battle with Mugen but that is only wath i think, we would never know. The girl is very funny and the mane reason of the sotyr afterall. This is a must, the only reason i gave 4,5 stars is that the series is too long, and some episides are not that good, but the end is incredible and episode that Mugen fights a guy that uses KI is also very good. One of my favorite series very worth it and very funny
