 This Mafia story has a lot of familiar elements. I've seen most of the actors in other Mafia movies and can well understand why. Yes, they are typecast. That's because they are so authentic. The plot is silly but it doesn't matter. It's an old theme, just a bit updated. The mob is now moving into cyberspace and international bank accounts. The young bucks in this film get an egghead computer guy to help. And from there on the fun begins. There's lots of violence and double crossing. But the most memorable stuff of all is the way the gangsters sit around a table and tell tale tales, insulting each other and having a grand old time. I don't think there's a dialogue coach in the world who would be able to teach them the nuances and the inflections. It is all very real. The story is cardboard though. A whole bunch of people get killed. And there's not a bit of love interest in the whole thing. Frankly, I love this type of film and I really enjoyed it. But I guess I'm just weird this way.
