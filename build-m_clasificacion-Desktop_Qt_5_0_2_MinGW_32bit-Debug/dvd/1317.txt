 This is a horror classic. It's worth all the hype and still stands the test of time. This is a thinking-person's horror movie. It's very frighening in an intellectual way but it's still a good all-around scare. I like the occassional in-your-face horror flick but this is not one of those. Still, if you watch closely, it's horribly frightening and some scenes stay with you for days. Slasher-flick fans be both warned and informed - this is not that kind of horror film but it's still well worth your time to check out. One of the great things about this film is the acting and the hidden, silent horrors. It was pure genius to start this film out like a sweet little love story between an ideal couple starting out in life together and then ending it gradually into total terror, with a supporting cast that goes from funny, to quirky, and then just plain evil.
