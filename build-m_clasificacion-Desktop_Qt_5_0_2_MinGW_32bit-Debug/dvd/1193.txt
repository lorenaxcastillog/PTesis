 He will ever be the image of Willie Wonka. No one else will ever come close. I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember. The only problem with watching it now is that my daughter runs out of the room every time the Oompa Loompa's come on. They scare the bejeebaz out of her. The music is wonderful and the setting supurb. My favorite scene is the ride on the "Wonkatania" and his monolog about the "Danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing" gets my blood going whenever I think about it. That's another scene that my daughter leaves the room for. Excellent movie with good morals. It tells the story, not so much of a chocolate factory and Willie Wonka, but how excess can destroy people. All the kids but Charlie fall victim to one of the vices that ruin people's lives. A good one to watch with the whole family, providing your small children aren't terrified of Oompa Loompa's
