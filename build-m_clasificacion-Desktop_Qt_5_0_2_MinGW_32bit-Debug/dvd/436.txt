 Yes I know. I said this was better than the first three Star Wars movies. Star Wars was a great trilogy, but being a Tolkien fan these movies were done amazingly. I had an idea of Middle-Earth in my mind after reading the books, but Peter Jackson makes you believe so vividly in the world that he has created. I loved every minute of each movie. That is the only movie I can say that about. The acting and CG are amazing. The casting choices were phenomanal and Peter Jackson showed us that he is the next Spielberg after King Kong. The funny thing is that the story of how Peter Jackson got this to the big screen is a lot like how George Lucas got Star Wars to the theatres too. At first Peter Jackson was going to make ONE movie of the three books, because no studio wanted to risk that much money on a dream project. New Line Cinema was one of the last studios he went too and they (thankfully) told him that there were three books so there should be three movies. Anyway, these movies are amazing. And thats all you need to know.
