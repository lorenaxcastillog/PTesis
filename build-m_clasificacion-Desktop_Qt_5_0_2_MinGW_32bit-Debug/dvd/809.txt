 Not a typical no brainer movie. This movie presents complex people with complex motives. Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways. He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life. This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife. He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work. Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies. He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it. He even tries to help his new boss. The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss. Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers
