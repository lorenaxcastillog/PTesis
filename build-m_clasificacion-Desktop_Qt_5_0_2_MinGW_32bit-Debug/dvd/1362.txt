 I enjoyed watching the documentary tremendously.If you always wanted to know what the feelings and attitudes of young Amish are concerning their religious tradition and restrictions this is a very good chance for `English`people like us to glimpse into their Amish world. It is very interesting how they deal to balance religious tradition and modern society. What I really enjoyed was watching the movie a second time but this time commented by the movie maker. That way you realize how hard it must have been to get Amish people on camera and even talk about their life, feelings and fears. Still if you already know a lot about Amish and their life especially about the period of 'rumspringa' in which teenagers are able to experience the English world before they decide whether or not to join the Amish church, this documentary does not give you deeper information. But still it is the best you can find about Young Amish and their controverse life
