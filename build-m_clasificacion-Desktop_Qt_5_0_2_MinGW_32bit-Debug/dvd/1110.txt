 At first glance, this is a silly little musical with no real value. Yes it has catchy tunes, yes it has a silly romance, and yes it has silly production numbers. But unlike most musicals, this film has multi-layers. One layer is pure sugar musical. The film also has real good chemistry between Renyolds and Parton. They both look like they really enjoyed making this film, and they both seemed to have enjoyed each other. This makes the film work at the very basic level. There is even a touching moment when Dolly sings "I'll Always Love You" to Burt. It is believable, or at least you want to believe. But after watching this film so close to the election I also noticed the second layer. A more in depth layer concerning politics, the media and how the media presents the truth. It's a biting satire, quite timely and extremely funny. Look for Charles Durning's scene stealing governor. This film is sharp and entertaining. A rare treasure in a musical from the 80s
