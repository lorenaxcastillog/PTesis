 Staying over at my house in high school almost always meant The Wall would make its way to the VCR. Not only because it was a great movie, but also because it had been stolen from every video store in town. By the time I was out of high school, the tape was literally worn out, and the weekly viewings had ceased. I'm not sure how I missed the first release, but I picked up the 25th Anniversary version the week it came out, and it brought back tons of memories. I'm not sure about some of the reviews here, as some claim that the transfer and audio aren't improved, and others claim it has been. While I can't comment on the differences between DVD's, I can say that the transfer was about what I expected, but the extras on the disc were a very nice surprise. That all said, I think the video transfer could have been improved. Obviously, the picture quality was better than VHS, but it was still rather grainy and dull. Though purists may disagree, I think a "Deluxe Edition" should show a little more work
