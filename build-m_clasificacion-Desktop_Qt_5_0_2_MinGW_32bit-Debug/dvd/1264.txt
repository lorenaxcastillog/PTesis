 This is an excellent boxed set. The extras are great, the shows never looked better, everything (finally) in the right order, as broadcast. Minor complaints, I had to order a replacement set because some of the DVDs were scratched, dirty, scuffed, etc. Then I mixed the best of the two sets, but I SHOULD NOT have to do this on a factory sealed product. If you buy it, examine the DVDs and don't settle. Maybe if these companies keep getting faulty product back, it will give them a reason to be more careful in manufacture. Sadly, it's a hassle for Amazon, and not their fault. When you open a factory sealed CD, it isnt all scratched and dirty, so why should DVDs be? No excuse for this. Also, the 13 Lucy/Desi specials should have been included in this set, they were really I Love Lucy shows, tho the title is different. Id have been glad to pay extra to have those also included. But none of this is Lucy's fault, and this set is LONG overdue for the fan. BUY IT, and enjoy.....
