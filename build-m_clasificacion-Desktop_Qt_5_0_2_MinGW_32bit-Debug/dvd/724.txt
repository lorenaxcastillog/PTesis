 OK, I love Japanese film and Kurosawa is my favorite Japanese director, but even a newbie to film will be hooked. I loved every aspect of this film....script, cinematography, acting, score, choreography, sound, and of course - direction! This is the complete Japanese version, includes film not seen in the original US release. Criterion has put together a great package, the quality of this DVD makes it worth the price. Included in the specials feature is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history. Only negative I could consider is its somewhat stagy, slow opening act...I loved this scene, especial since most of it was new to me (not in original us release) but someone new to Japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds. It builds in the next scene! A great movie, in complete form, presented in near pristine condition by a film master in top form. This is a 5 star release at any price! For those of you complaining about the price...rent it!
