 There are some differences between this film and the Patricia Highsmith novel it is based on. Some major changes to plot have been made, yet the intricacy of the original is not lost...in fact the screenplay and direction succeeds in inducing a sense of almost visual dizziness at the complex double life that Ripley leads and which constantly comes within a hair's breadth of unravelling. While the strengths of the film medium are successfully exploited, its unsurprising that the shocking sense of identification with a cold blooded killer which an intimite novel can provide is somewhat missing here. In fact Mat Damon's Ripley here is less of a psychopath and more of a sad loser that somehow blunders his way into an orgy of murder. Still, the superb playing of the leads together with a truly outstanding film score might well succeed in leaving you with an unhealthily Highsmithian sense of sympathy for the devil.
