 I was able to do an A and B comparison of Swordfish on DVD and HD-DVD by switching from one to the other on my TV. The DVD's colours were off. There was too much green and blue in the picture and not enough red, which made the whole movie over saturated with those colours and gave flesh tones an unrealistic look. Colour bleeding was also evident on certain scenes. Futhermore, the image was soft and blurred. The soundtrack was good but seemed to lack an umph feel to it. Switching to HD-DVD, what a difference Colours are accurate, flesh tones are natural and there is no evidence of colour bleeding. The image was very sharp and this was with the sharpness on my TV turned completely off. The Dolby Digital Plus track was bumpin'. It was extremely directional and powerful with my subwoofer getting a good workout. HD-DVD has arrived, and Swordfish does a great job showing off what HD-DVD can do
