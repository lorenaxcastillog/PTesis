 Video = ***** (clean widescreen transfer) Audio = **** (good) Story = ***** (Funny! Excellent characters, Excellent actors! Defintely re-watchable) Extras= **** (Extended pilot + Deleted scenes + few featurettes) Bought this after reading rave reviews online almost every site. Thanks to some of the reviews here, I discovered a gem that slipped past for way too long. For 'calibration' on sense of humour - I'm a huge Simpsons fan and 'Arrested' to me is the best sitcom to date. I suspect one of the reasons the show got axed is that it is difficult to enjoy the series if you missed the first few episodes and only catching it every now and then. However, watching the series on DVD means you get to grow with the funniest dysfunctional family on TV!! Several celebrity guests appearance as well. You'll laugh when watching it and laugh again when thinking about it. WARNING: The only bad thing about 'Arrested' is having to face the fact that it's only a short 2.5 seasons after falling in love with it..
