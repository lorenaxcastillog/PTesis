 Those who have enjoyed the "Prairie Home Companion" over the years, will probably enjoy this movie. It is a typical Garrison Keillor production with the addition of a thin plot and lots of celebrities. The show has supposedly been bought out by a company in Texas which plans to tear down the building and replace it with a parking lot. The cast, including Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as singing sisters, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a couple of randy, singing cowboys, performs a bittersweet and nostalgic last show. The celebrity singers do very well with the singing and the acting, and the movie becomes very similar to a typical "Prairie Home Companion" broadcast. The beginning of the show is somewhat disjointed, but once the performances start, the movie picks up speed and is full of gentle humor and toe-tapping songs. An angel in a white trench coat drifts through the movie, looking for someone to "take to God" and Lindsay Lohan adds a dark note as Streep's poetry-spouting, suicide-obsessed daughter. Some of it works and some of it doesn't, but the gentle humor and old-fashioned music remain
