 But I'm a Cheerleader~ Natasha Lyonne is a good movie that could have been so much better. Natasha Lyonne is perfect in the role as Megan. Megan is a cheerleader, has a boyfriend but she does not like to kiss him, has girls in her locker and thinks of girls all the time. Her "friends" and family decide that it is time for an intervention and send her away to a camp to turn her straight. The music is pretty awful and most of the lyrics seem to have been written in five minutes or by a high school rock band. I truly is the music that prevents me from giving this movie a 5 out of 5. The script is well written with well developed characters and a plot that is truly outstanding. The dialog is a hoot and there are many witty and good one liners. This is one good movie that could have easily attained 5 stars with the right soundtrack but as it is I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
