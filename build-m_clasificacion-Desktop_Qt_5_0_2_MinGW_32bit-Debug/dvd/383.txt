 I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like "half-caste"). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad
