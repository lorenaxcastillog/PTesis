 "Camp Stories" is a movie that ironically does not have a story, let along stories. David (played by Zach Zaylor) is forced to attend a Jewish all-boys camp when he would rather stay home and watch movies all summer. His parents tell him the reason he must go is, "Because your Jewish!" I knew I was in for a long 90 minutes when I heard that line. David quickly establishes himself as a hot-shot when he accepts a challenge from the reigning rafterball champ, Paul (Kris Park) and beats him. From there, David's camp adventures just get more and more exciting (YEAH RIGHT). The movie suffers from a lack of anything that would keep a viewer interested. The actors just plod along in a very episodic manner, there is literally nothing that happens in this movie that you will remember 5 minutes after you finish watching it. I served as an extra in this movie, and was unfortunate enough to see how poorly this film was made. How they got the actors they did (Elliot Gould, Jason Biggs, Jerry Stiller) is beyond me, but sadly I don't think any actor could have saved this script
