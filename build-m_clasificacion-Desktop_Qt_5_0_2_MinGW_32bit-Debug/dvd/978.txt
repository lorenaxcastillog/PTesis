 I've been waiting for this season, literally, for years. It contained (notice the past tense) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show. It was in the emergency clinic in the episode "My Sister, My Sitter" where the scene pans around showing the patients. Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down. When I first saw that, many years ago, I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room. She didn't even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of "hiding" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable. This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense. One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they didn't care who they offended. Well they went PC and now I'm highly offended! If they hadn't messed with it I would give them 5 stars, or more realistically I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. Quit tampering with the show, FOX!!
