 This set was a gift. I was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced. No artwork on the DVD, no artwork on the inside of the cases. The worst of all is the fact that Universal markets these sets as "complete & uncut". They are not uncut. "Last Salute to the Commodore" is missing more than 10 minutes of footage. In the 1970s, commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program. That is common now, but not in the 70s. "Commodore" runs just over 95 minutes. In a 2 hour slot, that leaves 25 minutes for commercials. As I said, not in the 70s. The show is very jumpy because of the cuts. Each of these episodes is heavily cut up. If you don't mind chopped up episodes, and cheaply done packaging, this set is for you. Otherwise, look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers. Universal deserves no one's loyalty. Universal is home of vast numbers of greed merchants
