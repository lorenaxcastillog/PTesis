 When a company offers you a standard and a widescreen version,you generally have a first rate quality dvd which is the case here.What i like about this comedy is that they made so much out of so little, because the plot is so thin that the songs had to be good and they are.One will always wonder what the team of RICHARD ADLER and JERRY ROSS could have gave us if ROSS would have live longer.Their two shows have become classics of the repertoire because DAMN YANKEES is just as good.It's a pity that JOHN RAITT didn't make more movies,he was a natural and his voice is perfect.The colors looks fabulous and i would like to say that a preservation like this one should be the standard for others to follow.A whole new generation can now appreciate THE PAJAMA GAME.I think that the deleted song deserved to be deleted ,even if DORIS sings it very well.So sit back and enjoy BABE and SID battle over the most important things in life:love and money
