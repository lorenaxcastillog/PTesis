 this great set features all of sergio leone's "man with no name" spaghetti westerns and if you love westerns or the spaghetti western then this is for you. yojimbo was the blueprint for the first film "a fistful of dollars" as lone gunfighter eastwood rides into a town at war and plays both sides of the street against each other with great gunfights and music by ennio morricone this is the beginning of the legend. the follow-up " for a few dollars more" put clint and lee van cleef on the sameside more or less as the go after a bankrobber and killer for the bounty and for more deeper reasons. not as good as "fistful" but still very good western fun. "the good, the bad, and the ugly" brings the trio to a stunning end as eastwood ,van cleef, and eli wallach as scum ball outlaws out to steal 100,000 dollars in gold from a grave yard. this is the masterpiece with acting, directing, and music bringing this tale of greed and double-crosses to vivid life. the transfers on these disc are great but little or no exrtas. enjoy this one and add it to your collection
