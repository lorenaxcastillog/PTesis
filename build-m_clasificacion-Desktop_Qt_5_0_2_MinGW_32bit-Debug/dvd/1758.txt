 All of the Fullmetal Alchemist volumes are good, but this is where it really gets... awesome. And I don't mean that as in the slang term, but that these episodes, from this point to the end, truly and honestly fill me with awe. In this volume is episode 42, and I've watched it, I don't know, dozens of times since it aired on adult swim. And still every time I watch it, I get cold chills all over. The effect is so powerful, it just doesn't fade. I've read a lot of books, watched a lot of TV and movies, and I have never come across anything as original as the story of Fullmetal Alchemist (anime and manga). But perhaps it is not as original as I think. If you can prove me wrong, please do so. Because if whatever it is, is even half as grand as this, then I'll be interested
