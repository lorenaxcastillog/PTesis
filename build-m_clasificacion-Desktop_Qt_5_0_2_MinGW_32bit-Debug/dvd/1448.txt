 Insomniac with Dave Attell Uncensored Volume 2, is by far a much improved disc collection. Once again Dave takes us to ten cities and stays up all night 'til morning sun to show you what happens while most people are asleep. Of course, he visits numerous crazy bars, some with male frontal nudity and many topless females too. Dave also walks the streets to talk to some interesting or uninteresting people. Some like to expose themselves to Dave or just for the camera. Dave also visits a cemetary, a skating center with roller derby girls, a Mardi Gras parade in Key West, a tortilla making place, Alaska Solstice Celebration, shark fishing, sex playrooms, night time skiing, piercing, cow milking, fishing at Ship Creek, Isle of Capri Casino, undergroud coal mining, live sex show, cannibis & juice shop, legal prostitution and much more. Cities include, Key West, Florida. Austin, Texas. Miami, Florida. Boise, Idaho. Anchorage, Alaska. Kansas City, Missouri. Charleston, West Virginia. Amsterdam, Netherlands. Las vegas, Nevada. New York City, New York. Episodes are from 2001-2003. What was blurred out on television on the Comedy Central cable channel is all shown for all to see on this uncensored 2-disc set
