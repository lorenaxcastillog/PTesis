 Well I went to bed at 10 pm all excited about getting to bed early. I made the mistake of putting on the TV to see what was on Discovery Health Channel. We I accidently put on a movie channel and I saw the very beginning of this movie and a young Robert Blake. Well at 12:15 I finally went to bed. I could not for a second pull myself away from this movie. This proves again to me how good movies were in the year 1967. The performances of Blake and Wilson were riveting. When I had conflicting feelings over a character througout the movie then I know they are giving me a performance. The black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent. There are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but "In Cold Blood" ranks at near the top. I would highly recommend this movie for a quiet evening if you would like to watch a cinematically compelling movie and stellar acting
