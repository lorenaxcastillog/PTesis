 Edited by Edward Norton, this PBS series takes a look at the ways in which man has unintentionally altered his environment for the worse. Some examples include hermaphrodite frogs resulting from water pollution, out of control plant life which threatens the survival of ecosystems, and overfishing and its relation to coral reef degradation. While this series is quite informative, it is also entertaining. Norton lends a good, serious narrative to the series, and though the series presents the audience with disasterous (or potentially disasterous) scenarios, the segments usually end with a success story or a glimmer of hope. For instance, one scientist engineers a plant to absorb, or "eat", the mercury which is polluting the waters. Another segment ends with a private farmer demonstrating environmentally-friendly farming techniques to preserve local water integrity. Highly recommended. I doubt this series has the entertainment value to hold a young teenager's (or younger) attention for long, but anyone with even a passive interest in biology and/or the environment should be pleased with this series
