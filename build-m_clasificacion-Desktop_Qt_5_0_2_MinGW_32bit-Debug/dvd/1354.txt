 I've had the VHS version of this video for about 4 years (and now am going to purchase the DVD). When I do this workout every week, my lower body looks more toned, and I feel stronger when I walk anywhere. Other reviewers point out that it's not much of a step workout, but my heart rate really stays up there during the entire routine because of the concentrated lower body exercise. I think Kathy has a good mix of stepping and lower body work. The step is a great tool for lower body work anyway. Even though it's categorized as a more intermediate level, I find that each time I do the entire workout, it really kicks my butt. Overall, for lower body toning and cardiovascular, it's great and I would recommend it. I also thought that Kathy would be obnoxious, but she's very pleasant to work out to, and much more tolerable than people who appear on other workout videos I have
