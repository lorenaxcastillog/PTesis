 If you're a longtime Clash fan, this video will make you salivate. It has all of the ringing tones of the Clash's lyrical content in the plot, as well as numerous live performances and casual footage. For instance, it shows the late, great, Joe Strummer curled up into an inhuman ball on the stage, moaning to the audience, yelling at and dispersing bouncers during "Janie Jones," and playing the piano while chatting with the main character, Ray. It shows Paul Simonon relaxing and enjoying some reggae music, and being collected after his arrest for shooting pigeons. It shows Topper Headon hitting and kicking a punching bag while dressed in a yellow excersize suit. And it shows Mick Jones singing into the microphone, snapping at our slightly bigoted main charcater, and showing up late to rehearsals. All this comes on top of the life and times of Clash fan/roadie/sex shop employee Ray Gange, and the plight of two young black men in the chaotic year of 1978 in Britain. I'd say that for all of this, this film is definitely worth watching, if not owning
