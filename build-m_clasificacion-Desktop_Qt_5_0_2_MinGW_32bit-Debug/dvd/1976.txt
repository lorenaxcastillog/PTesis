 ... and really, the best part of all of Fushigi Yugi, including Eikoden (shudder) and Oni (though not including the manga). As I said in my previous review of Suzaku, I believe this series is under-rated, and, to repeat myself further, I was guilty of this as well. I really didn't like the first few episodes, but kept watching and grew to like it. Then I saw Seiryu, and it was all worth it. Seiryu has all of the characters we have grown to love, with a much deeper, darker message than Suzaku. We grow to understand why Yui has grown to hate Miaka so much (you would too if you ended up with a mind-f***er like Nakago). We really begin to feel for the characters and their heart-ache. And we begin to see Yu Watase's deeper messages: messages about life, love, friendship and war. When I first started Suzaku, I wondered how anyone (Gilles Poitras) could list Fushigi Yugi in their top 41 recommended titles. Seiryu made me see why. It's a great series, and once you make it through the first half, you can enjoy the wonderful second installment
