 I just returned from visiting the island of Jamaica and traveling to the home of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's family estate. Standing on the windswept veranda of the home high on a hill miles from the ocean but from where I could see the blue Caribbean, I was reminded of the scene from "Wide Sargasso Sea" which took place at the honeymoon home of Antoinnette and her English husband, Edward Rochester; the scene in which Rochester, still under the influence of the love potion, "too strong for a white man" has sex with Antoinnette's milatto half sister. I read "Wide Sagasso Sea" and saw the movie years ago but suddenly I needed to own the video as I own the book. The islands are all beautiful but with their sad, slave ridden history and present day poverty, it's painful to visit them. I wish something could be done to help the people of Jamaica and the other islanders so they could live better and not have to depend on the ficleness of tourism alone
