 Interesting and frightening mystery about a woman (Johanna Ter Steege) who is kidnapped in a convenience store while her boyfriend (Gene Bervoets) waits for her in his car. For three years Bervoets searches for her, to no avail. After the kidnapping occurs we (the audience) are shown what the kidnapper (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) is all about: we see that he's an intelligent sociopath and are shown how and why he does the kidnapping. Director George Sluizer does some excellent cutting and interweaving of the two interlocking stories involving the men, and the viewer's interest never slackens. Bervoets and Donnadieu meet finally and what happens to Bervoets (as was the case with Ter Steege) is truly horrific. The movie is scarier and better than most movies like this because Sluizer is more intersted in intelligent motives than the usual horror/mystery concerns (wild action, sex, bloodshead). Chances are most viewers will remember this movie for a long time after seeing it.
