 This was one of the first The Firm workouts I bought. I was disappointed with the warm up, I don't think even now that she does enough on this, especially with the amount of climbing and squatting that is done. I just learned to do alittel additional stretching beforte I started. That said, the rest of the workout is pretty good. She transitions well from one move to another (some of the other video's it seems you aren't quite where you need to be for the next sequence, or you just aren't where you need to be) giving it a pretty good flow. She alternates upper and lower body with aerobics making it fun to do. If the warm up isn't great the cool down and stretch is one of the best and I incorporate some of the stretches into other video's. I still use this workout even though I have others that are newer. My biggest complaint about the Firm is that for every new video I buy I have to get a new piece of equipment, I wish they would incorporate some of their old equipment into new workouts.
