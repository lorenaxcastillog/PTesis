 TAP NEEDS TO BE RELEASED ON DVD,(as in YESTERDAY)! As one of the great tap dancing stories of all time we find great jazz, assorted excellent dance routines, and a great performance from the heart of the actors and dancers. We are offered a glimpse of true tap and dance spirit which produces a wonder and soulful delight. The powerful skill and musical essence of Gregory Hines, together with others in the cast contribute to the foundation of a powerful production and storyline. Gregory Hines proformance proves to be incredibily the best of his entertainment career. I will miss him and wonder what more he could have inspired. A great story that needs to be upgraded to state of the art restoration in DVD with the best audio options available. I think it will come back to surprise alot of people. A MUST FOR DVD ! ! ! PLEASE GIVE IT AN AUDITION! WE WILL BUY ! !
