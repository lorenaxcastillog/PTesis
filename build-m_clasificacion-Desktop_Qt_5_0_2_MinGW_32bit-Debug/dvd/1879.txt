 I have tried other stability ball workout videos/dvds and found this one pretty comprehensive for a beginner. The instructor gives you the basics on how to use the stability ball including proper breathing techniques and posture (vital information for not hurting oneself). The instructor always gives you a preview of what the move is suppose to look like and how it is supposed to feel before you try out the move yourself. I have used the program on a regular, weekly basis and have always found it challenging so far. This program does offer some alternate moves for a more challenging or easier workout. However,I feel that it does not offer enough of a challenge option when I progress further. The chapter selections are by target body regions and very easy to navigate. You may choose to skip the introduction and go straight to the workouts when you feel more confident about your skills.
