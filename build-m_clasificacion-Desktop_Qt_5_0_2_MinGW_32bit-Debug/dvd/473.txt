 Most everyone who has given an online review of Moulin Rouge has noted the color and clarity of this DVD release, and I agree with the consensus, the picture quality is excellent. For some reason what seems to be overlooked is the SOUND QUALITY of the film. Apparently, the sound wasn't cleaned-up as best as it could have or was not given the attention it should have been given or there was nothing that could have been done. I tend to believe if closer attention was given to the audio it could have been better. Let's not forget besides viewing the film we also have to listen to it. Quite a few times I had to go back to watch a scene over to understand the dialogue. Hopefully next time around when MGM updates this DVD the'll take another crack at the audio. When it comes to buying CD's and DVD's, sometimes we will only get the best quality if we demand it. Video and Record executives have earned a reputation for taking shortcuts and it is up to consumers to hold them to a higher standard
