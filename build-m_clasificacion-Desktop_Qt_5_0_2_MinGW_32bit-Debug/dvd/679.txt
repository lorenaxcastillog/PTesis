 This very helpful DVD instructed me on how to groom our two standard Poodles and also our American Cocker Spaniel, from start to finish...even the lovely poodle topknot and foot precision cuts were shown. For years I was intimidated to attempt doing this myself, but the groomer in the video thoroughly demonstrates so many different cuts at an easy-to-keep-up pace, and is so geared toward teaching the novice, like myself, that it actually turned out to be fun and very rewarding. It wasn't scary or overwhelming as I had imagined. I also finally learned how to trim our dog's toenails, and I discovered the benefits of proper bathing and other care issues, as shown and discussed. I highly recommend this excellent DVD to anyone who has any breed of dog that requires a haircut. All that said, along with it's very reasonable price, I give Doggie Cuts Amazon.com's top rating
