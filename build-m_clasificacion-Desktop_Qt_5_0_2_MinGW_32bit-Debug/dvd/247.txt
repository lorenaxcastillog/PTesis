 I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot. Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers. It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it. From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water
