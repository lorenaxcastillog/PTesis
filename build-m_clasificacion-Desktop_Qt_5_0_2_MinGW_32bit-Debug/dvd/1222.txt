 This is a great workout as a whole (or more than one segment at least). Michelle Dozois (Shape dvd's) is energetic and enthusiastic without going overboard. She is motivating and cues very well. The five segments are Slow and Steady Burn, Carb Killer, Power Blast, Interval Burn and Metabolism Booster. The thing I like about this is that you can customise your own workout or do them in order. There's great music to also keep you motivated and give you a good workout routine. The only problem is that you really should do a minimum of two workouts in a row or you won't get as much benefit as possible. One segment is fine on it's own if you are topping up from another routine you do. But overall, I think everyone will like this because it's great if you are short on time and because you can mix it up, it doesn't get boring. I love it
