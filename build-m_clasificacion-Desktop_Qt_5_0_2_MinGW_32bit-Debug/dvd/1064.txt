 My children have watched these videos for years. My oldest is 11 and he still loves them. I have learned so much myself from the Dave Hood series. Dave seems to have a real love for children and his personality is wonderful. The reviewer that commented that their 2 year old wasn't interested probably hasn't clued into the fact that 2 year olds have no business watching television. As a preschool teacher and home educator, I've learned that most children under 4 can't understand the difference between television and reality. They are very literal and don't understand jokes. My son was so obsessed with trucks when he was 3 that he started crying when he saw a "broken" truck as we passed the scene of a car accident. The Dave Hood videos are very educational and entertaining. Our family has tried many different "truck" videos, and these are the best on the market. I wouldn't recommend, however, the newer editions that don't include Dave Hood
