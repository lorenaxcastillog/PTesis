 An extraordinary film, The Remains of the Day, brings to the screen the story of an English butler, during the interwar period (and after), whose loyalty, devotion and integrity surpass all known human limitations. It is a film about human relations, love, hope and inner strength, but most importantly about honor, duty, and loyalty; qualities that sadly seem to have vanished from every day life. Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Christopher Reeves, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, The Remains of the Day is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
