 I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't "get it" by watching the movie alone, I say it is a failure on the film maker's part. That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally "get it", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it
