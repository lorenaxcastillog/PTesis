 Okay here's the poo! I'm 23 and as previously stated collect movies(DVD mostly) and this is a classic.If you want to know what it's about scroll down and there's a hundred reviews explaining it. That being said this is a classic!!. Horror,comedy,and Bruce Campbell what more should be said, but seriously this has some of the most twistedly funny scenes I've ever seen plus it's modern history this is one of the top ten cult classics ever,If you don't believe me about it being twisted check out dead linda dancing or the moose/hand scenes it's beautiful gore/comedy at it's artistic finest.I am NOT some dumb punk kid,I'm educated and a public servant (City Employee) so don't write my views off.For as cheap as this is especially on amazon used or new,it SHOULD be purchased.This movie does not dissapoint(although a little demented!!).Thanks for your time,Now buy this sucker and JOIN US! (deadites that is).
