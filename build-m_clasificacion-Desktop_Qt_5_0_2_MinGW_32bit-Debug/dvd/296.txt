 I recommend this DVD set for anyone even halfway interested in John Wayne and/or John Ford films. Great editions of eight classic or near classic films, at least a couple not available until now, a very cool 2-disc edition of "The Searchers", and a remastered 2-disc set of "Stagecoach". All for a little over $50! Particularly impressive - "They Were Expendable", the WW II PT Boat story. Good acting from top to bottom, great black and white film work, and really good, stirring, special effects in a couple of spots. Also, "The Three Godfathers", a mystical John Wayne western? Interesting. Only confusing omission - no "The Quiet Man", also a Ford/Wayne project. ??? I guess you've always got to leave something off to keep the customer interested. And come to think of it, "Rio Grande" was also not included, so obviously you can't have everything. Side Note: Typical great service from Amazon.
