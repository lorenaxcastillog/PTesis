 Simply put, this is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time. It's better than Walk the Line and better than Ray. Every scene serves a purpose and is perfectly executed. I'll admit that my expectations going in weren't that high, but the movie paid off in every way. Don't get me wrong, not everyone is going to like this film. You need to have an IQ over 70 to understand that Hustle and Flow is an extremely accurate reflection of real life for a significant portion of our society. Its purpose is not to make judgments about the morality of people's behavior. You can tune in to Fox News for that drivel. It's about working hard, creating something out of nothing, and doing whatever it takes to accomplish your dreams even though the odds are against you. In my view, a classic tale of the American Dream.
