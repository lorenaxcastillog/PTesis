 This is an outstanding movie--probably one of the best of all time--and who CARES if that's because the screenplay was adapted from an even better book? Aren't movies usually disappointing compared to the book when it's a bookworm doing the review? The MOVIE is what's being reviewed here. IMHO, reviews based on "the book is better" should be automatically deleted. Having said that, don't miss Cliff Robertson's outstanding performance in this heart-wrenching tale of a mentally challenged adult who overcomes his disability by receiving experimental surgery, only to be disappointed with the outcome, both in ways that have already been spoiled by others here and in other ways I will not spoil myself. It is a classic tale with the best elements of theatre. If it helps to understand, this movie would be just as outstanding if it were a filmed version of Cliff Robertson in a stage play. I assure you that if you're mature and like insightful movies, you'll enjoy this movie. I don't know how good the book is, because I haven't read it, but this is a movie review
