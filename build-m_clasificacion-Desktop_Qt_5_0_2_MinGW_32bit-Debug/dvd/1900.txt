 Karen Black (Burnt Offerings) burned herself into my memory w/ this 1975 TV anthology! For 30 years I remembered the Zuni fetish doll in the AMELIA segment, unable to recall much about the first two stories. Well, I just watched TOT again tonight, and I liked all three tales. While AMELIA is still my favorite, I found both JULIE and MILLICENT AND THERESE to be creepy and fun. Karen Black is a chameleon, changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress, then terrified victim, and finally into savage huntress, all in under 80 minutes! Dan Curtis (Night Stalker, Night Strangler) allows Ms. Black to show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable, while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed! This is one of those rare TV horror masterpieces that the 70s churned out. Like DUEL, NIGHT STALKER, THE DEAD DON'T DIE, etc., TRILOGY OF TERROR made it's mark. I'm glad to see it back on DVD...
