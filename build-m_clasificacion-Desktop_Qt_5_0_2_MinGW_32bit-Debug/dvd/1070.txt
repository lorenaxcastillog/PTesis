 No special effects and no cheesy gimicks. What you do get with Working Girl is a wonderful blend of acting talent (Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith [believe it or not] and Sigourney Weaver)and outstanding chemistry by both principal and supporting casts. How good is this movie? Even a gifted director couldn't hurt it. Mike Nochols does a fantastic job of making these varied talents meld into magnificense. The best example is when Jack (Harrison Ford) meets Tess ( Melanie Griffith) but does not reveal his identity. The result was one of the most memorable moments of the film: Tess proclaims: "I have a head for business, and a bod for sin...is there anything wrong with that?" Astonished, Jack quips "No...I didn't know they let bad girls into these things." The film is filled with moments such as these. The supporting cast is awesome. Joan Cusack deserves special kudos for her performance. "Coffee, Tea...ME?" This film is a must for any respectable collector. I highly recommend that you buy this film, not just rent it.
