 i recorded the live aid concert on vhs. & I mean i was up at six am to catch it when it started in australia. inxs was the bomb. & I would have bought this disc if they included "oz for africa' on it too. that was during the "listen like thieves" era (actually BEFORE the cd was released) not to mention a plethra of incredible talent all of which i'd love to have on dvd.& then to know that 85 other songs are missing from the dvd (of which i'm pretty sure i have on vhs still) it just kills me that someone sat down & decided what "the masses" would have liked to see. I'd be happier if someone just came out & said that they couldn't get the copyrights to the stuff. ok, i'm done with my ranting, thanks for the heads up. I won't be buying this until they include EVERYTHING damn it
