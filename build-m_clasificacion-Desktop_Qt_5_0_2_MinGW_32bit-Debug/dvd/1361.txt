 I visited simular churches in Lancaster Co Pa,and Elkhart ,Indiana. These churches are similar to the Amish in dress, rural lifestyle, limits on formal education, and no tv or movies, but allow electricity, telephones, and cars. Some members are peple who left the old order Amish for a less restrictive church. The experimentation with drugs, alcohol and sex depicted in this documentary is more likely to happen in larger Amish settlements. Amish youth have money because they are often employed. Some people move away from larger settlements and towns to keep their teens away from such temptations. FOr many youth, rumspringa consists only of hymn sing parties, dinner parties at home and playing team sports. I am African American and while some pleople were very prejudiced against me ,many others were glad to meet someone different and wanted to share their faith, their homes, and their lifestyle with me. It is an experience I'll never forget. Lucy Walker captured a bit of an insider view of a seldom photographed and seldom interviewed group of people whose way of life bucks conventional wisdom
