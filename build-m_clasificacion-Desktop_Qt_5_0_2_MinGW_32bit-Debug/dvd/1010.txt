 this movie is about Christian Slater (Heathers, True Romance) who plays Hard Harry the pirate radio man of his pirated show. this is a movie that deals with rebellion and teen angst..kids who want to live their lives free of all the things they are imprisoned to do and they tune into Slater's show everynight to listen to him speak it loud and proud. Samantha Mathis' (Broken Arrow, That Thing Called Love) film debut...this is number 1 out of the 3 movies her and Slater star together in. Cheryl Pollack (My Best Friend Is A Vampire) is hotter then ever. Slater's flawless performance and unforgettable moments make this one a masterpiece and a movie not to be forgotten, one of the best movies of 1990. Also starring Mimi Kennedy (Tv's Dharma and Greg), Scott Paulin, Andy Romano, Ellen Greene (Talk Radio) and Billy Morrisey (Severed Ties) co-star. note: Seth Green (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Party Monster) has a short but recognizable role in here and so does Martin Landau's daughter Juliet Landau (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Ed Wood).
