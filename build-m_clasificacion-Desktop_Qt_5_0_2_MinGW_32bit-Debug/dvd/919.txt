 I loved the entire series when it first came on the air and it was great to see it all over again revisting Remington Steele Investigations. When I first saw Pierce Brosnan on this show I knew he would become James Bond one day. But it is Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt who creates the agency by creating a ficticious boss that is the foundation of the show. Her spunk and creativity drives the episodes and is an inspiration for other women. The romance between her and Mr. Steele smolders for several seasons. Who can say enough about Doris Roberts, a terrific seasoned actress as their administrative/secy side kick....just wonderful. The final episode is the one you waited for, for over 5 years! You wished there was more but you can imagine that they lived happily ever after. Enjoy Seasons 4 and 5 but don't forget how it all began in seasons 1 thru 3. You can trace the gradual maturity in their realtionship and approach to business throught all 5 seasons. Remington Steele is not only a terrific TV series but an American icon in the genre of detective shows.
