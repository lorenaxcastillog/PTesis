 If you like scary stories but are uncomfortable with evil themes... This is a supernatural suspense show that you don't have to pre screen for your "Tween-Agers" who like scary. This is not really as good of a show as say, "Medium" but, every episode of this show "Ghost Whisperer" is uplifting (like the conclusion of the film "Sixth Sense"), where Melinda is able to help the "Earth Bound Spirits" resolve their issues and "cross over". Again though it seems like a comparison to Medium is natural, Medium is mostly dealing with the finding of very bad people that commit crimes that I don't want to have my younger kids exposed to. Ghost Whisperer is usually just scary enough to pique your interest and not scary enough to give bad dreams to your kids (or you), and has a good supporting cast (with likable characters), semi-continuity, and of course a very pretty star. So get this set and enjoy a commercial free marathon!
