 Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as "Bring it on", "Clueless", "Mean Girls" and, especially the superior "Heathers".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, "John Tucker Must Die" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. "JTMD" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. "Heathers" = 5 stars. "Mean Girls" = 4 stars. "Bring it on" = 4 stars. "Clueless" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that "John Tucker Must Die" doesnt have..
