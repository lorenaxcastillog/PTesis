 This was a black comedy that unfolded over the first 30 minutes of the film, revealing one surprise relationship after another, until you realize that all the major characters are related in surprising ways. It's kind of strange, because this movie wasn't terribly complicated, but I'm still not sure what to make of it. Catherine O'Hara has her two military helicopter-pilot sons scare her cheating husband, whose cheating on her with Drew Barrymore. The husband is successfully scared (to death) and Drew Barrymore is an earwitness through her headset at a burger joint. I won't say "Home Fries" is a complete waste. I was somehow taken in enough to watch the entire movie. One shining light is Luke Wilson, who steals most of the scenes he has, and the crazy thing is that he's stealing them from actors like Jake Busey and Catherine O'Hara. It was the overall movie premise and plot lines that were average at best. After the first 30 minutes of the movie you could see the direction the film would take. Overall, this movie didn't know which way it wanted to go. A comedy? A drama? A romantic comedy? I'm still not sure
