 This movie to me was just entering the life of another community far from mine. it was interesting to see how they lived and the way their community worked. You'll meet a boy and soon after his family who have to deal with their mothers apparent mental issues where she just doesn't seem to behave correctly and sometimes looses control. in the end though it seemed more about the family and their life and how the community was also a part of it. The plot to the movie is different.. just like a glimpse to their world then ends. I was a bit disappointed as i hoped for more of a storyline or at least a memorable ending. but afterwards i felt it went with the flow of the movie and would be something I may want to watch on occasion.. if your looking for an action flick or edge of your seat movie this is not it though. Valeria is also very pretty and to me resembles an Italian Sarah Jessica Parker (just my opinion
