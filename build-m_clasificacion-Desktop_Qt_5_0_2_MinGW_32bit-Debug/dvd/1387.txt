 This is a "girl power" movie on the surface, but on the larger scale it's about how loss and grief have far-reaching effects. When Idgie Threadgood's older brother Buddy is killed in a freak train accident (I still can't bear to watch that part, no matter how many times I've seen the movie), she loses the big brother she idolizes. Pure tom boy, none of the others in her home seem to understand her. Witnessing Buddy's terrible death firsthand only causes Idgie to become withdrawn and strangely eccentric as time goes on. Thinking that only one other person can draw her out of this cocoon of grief and reaction--Ruth, the girlfriend Buddy left behind who also witnessed the same train accident--Idgie's mother calls Ruth home for a summer. Now a young woman, Idgie seems one part tomboy, and two parts a strange kind of 1930's train-riding Beatnick (albeit a bit early for that.) The two women forge a powerful relationship, one that sees them through abusive marriage, murder, and a unique kind of love. Highly recommended for women of all ages, but don't be surprised if you need your hankies. Deidre
