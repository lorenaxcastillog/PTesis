 Okay, this is a really bad movie. That said, there are some moments here that are so over-the-top bad that they're funny. The fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving Sandra Bullock is outright hilarious...and very embarassing. How she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery, but the acting in that scene is ridiculous, as well. However, it is certainly memorable. Sandra Bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film, but her role is essentially a throw away part. Then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor Steve Buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in. His character never returns to the story after that. By the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues. The acting is bad, the budget is obviously low, and the script, which invokes the occasional giggle, is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel. Avoid this film
