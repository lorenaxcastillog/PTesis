 Shame on talented actors like Maura Tierney and Jerry Orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie. Uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it. "Star"/co-writer John Romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time, and this is his only film, and I can see why. He plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by Tierney, who also works in a local factory run by Orbach. Dennis Christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator; and June Lockhart and Lyle Waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as Tierney's estranged parents. The movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it's so shoddily included, it makes no statement at all. Little heard of movie; I can see why
