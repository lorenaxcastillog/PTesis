 Hello, I have not had the opportunity to view the DVD version of Fame yet but I plan to order it, so someday soon! However, I thought it was worth my time to interject on a couple of the reviews that have been posted. First: one lady commented that this movie was not suitable for her child because of the language and nudity, so it deserved 1 star. Please note that this movie was rated R in the theatre, and is listed as Rated R here on Amazon. How much clearer does one need to be. Rated R MEANS not suitable for children. Do not blame the movie for your poor judgement. Do not use this review in deciding to purchase the DVD. Second: A gentleman commented that this movie did not contain all of the music from the original stage production. Well,unless I am mistaken, that would be because the movie came first. The musical expanded upon the movie, as did the television show. So please know this when using his review. Just my two cents on the matter. :)
