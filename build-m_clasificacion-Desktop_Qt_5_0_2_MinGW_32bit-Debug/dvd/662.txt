 A Sci-Fi cult drama of the beginning of the 70's, "The Omega Man" (98 minutes), was directed by Boris Sagal based on the novel "I Am Legend", of Richard Matheson. Charlton Heston is Robert Neville, a military scientist who developed an experimental vaccine in time to save himself of the devastating and apocalyptic biological war between China and Soviet Union. Living a boring and lonely routine, Neville has been in a bunker for three years in a ruined Los Angeles, and spends his time searching for food and armaments to fight the members of the "Family", some hundreds of survivors of the holocaust that had become albinos mutants and psychotic homicides. The group follows the rules, with a religious fervor, of the leader Matthias (the actor Anthony Zerbe), that before the catastrophe was a popular TV presenter. They now want to destroy Neville at any cost because they consider him pernicious, as a symbol of the science and technology that destroyed the humanity and transformed them into a group of dead-livings creatures. The soundtrack is of Ron Grainer and the film is unforgettable..
