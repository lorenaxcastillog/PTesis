 The second season is where Samurai Jack and the series really becomes great. This is where Jack learns to jump, falls down a hole into Wonderland, fights for the honor of his sandals, flees the best hunters in the galaxy, robot assassins, and Demongo, a collector of souls. He fights in the Dome of DOOM, helps 300 Spartans defeat an army of evil robots and a mountain helps him defeat his own inner demons. He has to deal with a gargoyle, help the Scotsman save his own wife and has to deal with the feelings that the ruins of his old home bring about. Lone Wolf and Club even make an appearance! Each and every episode is a hit. Add the extras which include one commentary, a pitch (where an artist tries to sell an idea to the others) and the scrapbook which is a small short about where Genndy Tartakovsky came from, where he got his ideas and even about his family
