 I still don't know all what to say about this movie, since I only just saw it a couple days ago and its still simmering in my mind. But I do know it had a big impact on me. The way it was made, the way it showed you this world they lived in and how it was so quickly taken away. The movie isn't perfect, but for some reason I wouldn't change a thing. McJagger is dead on as Greta/George, and Clive Owen is amazing. Actually all performances in this film were excellent. And the title "Bent" is a word that means homosexual (as opposed to "straight"), and certainly not referring to the shape of the main character's penis as was stated in a previous review. I don't know where they got that idea. the movie is hardly so shallow as to focus on such an insignificant thing as the man's penis when the emotional scope of the film is simply epic. 5 stars. see it if you can handle holocaust 'downers
