 Considerng the adult humor and partial nudity, I was lucky as a kid to even be allowed to watch this movie on cable, especially since the "Blue Lagoon" came out shortly beforehand. My parents probably thought this was an innocent little film about mermaids. Some 22 years later, the movie still manages to be funny and charming...plus, now I get all the jokes. Who can resist a tale about finding the woman of your dreams who turns out to be more than what you bargained for? If you watch the credits at the end of the movie, you'll see the underwater city that Madison came from, something I had never noticed before. Ron Howard, Eugene Levy, Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah and John Candy probably never this movie would be the platform for making them huge A-list stars some twenty years later. This is a classic and a keeper. Future generations will enjoy as well.
