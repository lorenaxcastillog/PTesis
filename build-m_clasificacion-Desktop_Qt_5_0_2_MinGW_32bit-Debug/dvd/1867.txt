 With a current record of 11-27, the 2006 Pittsburgh Pirates have given this fan of 18 years very little to cheer about. In fact, with the exception of the 97 season, the Pirates have done almost nothing since the heart breaking 92 NLCS and haven't produced a winning season since. With this DVD we can all go back in time and watch the 79 World Series where they didn't depend on one player, as in Stargell, to do everything for them. The 79 team had every player on the team contribute. Even the first game, a loss for the Pirates had plenty of decent play by the entire team after the 1st inning. Chuck Tanner uses his bullpen wisely and there's never a sense of doom and gloom the recent years has given us. These are not the Pirates I have gotten used to seeing the last decade and that's a good thing
