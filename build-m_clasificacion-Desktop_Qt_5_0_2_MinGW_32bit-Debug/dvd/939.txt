 All I want to say about the movie, seeing as how it already has been touched on by 670 something people before me is that this film is beautiful and deep and entertaining. The negative things that people say are unwarranted i.e. "The faces have no emotion" actually they have alot of expressions, the cgi is exceptional and there is a fine range of emotion. The biggest complaint people have is that the movie isn't "Final Fantasy", this is of course coming from those people that love the RPG games and think anything attached to the "Final Fantasy" title has to have "swords and potions". I'm just trying to tell you guys that this film explores a beautifully animated and completely realized world and alot of work was put into the film. Almost anyone with an open mind is bound to enjoy this movie and acknowledge how hard the filmmakers worked to bring it to the screen.
