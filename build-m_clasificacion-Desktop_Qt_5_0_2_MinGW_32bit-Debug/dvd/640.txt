 Hitch is a ladies' man. Or so he thought. He's got a PhD in love and he knows just how to create a slight bit of hope into the life of a man who just does not have the stuff. But the one person he can't help is himself, his name is Alex Hitchens, but you can call him Hitch. Will Smith was born destined to play this role, he expands his great horizon of rap, hip-hop, action and comedy movies into the romantic category. The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the one woman who's falling in love with Alex Hitchens, and trying to ruin Hitch. This hilarious, passionate and educational romance story is one for the ages. It ends up teaching all of us a lesson, not of how to impress women (even though I got a few helpful tips), but of the meaning of love and how difficult it is to achieve it
