 Although "Cecil B. Demented" was not a bad movie, it was not near as good as Waters' best films. But do not worry. John Waters is back with "A Dirty Shame". The plot is the usual one: The uptight establishment is outraged at the free thinkers. In "Hairspray" they were integrationists, this time they are nymphomaniacs. The cast is excellent. Tracey Ullman is almost as good as Kathleen Turner was in "Serial Mom". I hadn't heard about Suzanne Shepherd before but she is great here as Ethel, and Waters regular Mink Stole is wonderful as usual. Patricia Hearst is given a nice cameo role, and towards the end of the movie, David Hasselhoff plays himself. For those not familiar with John Waters, this movie may not be the kind of comedy they were hoping for. For Waters fans, with "A Dirty Shame", Waters proves his ability to perfectly combine the advantages of high budget "mainstream" filmmaking, with his special brand of humour that made his early movies so funny.
