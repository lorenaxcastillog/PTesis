 I am laughing at those 2 star reviews saying how AVP is destroying the Alien and Predator legacy because of its nonexistent plot. All I am going to say is this: go back and watch Alien and P1 again before passing any judgment. I did recently. Both has even less of a story than AVP. Both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today. Those 2 star reviewers are comparing AVP to how they remember Alien and Predator. Memories are doing a real number on them. The only thing that AVP lacks is originality. However, the story will continue. AVP1 sets the stage for sequels. We should wait and see how it develops. Meanwhile, enjoy the incredible CG and action sequences. In short, AVP is an awesome 90 minute thrill ride, that I am willing to take again and again. And for the record, Paul Anderson is a great director. Check out his "Resident Evil 1." As another side note, James Cameron ranked AVP as the 3rd best among the 5 Alien movies, after "Alien" and his "Aliens"
