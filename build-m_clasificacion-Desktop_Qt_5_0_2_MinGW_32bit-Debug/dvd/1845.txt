 Sara Ivanhoe does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating poses. She points out common mistakes and gives helpful advice on how to correct them. The twelve poses are a good foundation for a beginner doing yoga for the first time. It is worth watching - but only once. The problem is that she spends over a minute between each pose talking about them. Rather than telling the viewer what to do as they are doing it, she demonstrates, talks, talks some more, then she tells you to begin (each pose is held for 6 breaths). I'd much rather that she explained things as she was doing them. Sure, then you may not get everything the first time, but at least the program would not drag on as it does. The other thing I didn't like about this was the "boing" sound effects of the For Dummies tips. If I'm doing yoga to relax, I want to hear soothing music, not annoying popup sound effects. If you have never done any yoga before, this may be worth renting to watch once. However, I would not recommend buying it. You won't care to watch it again
