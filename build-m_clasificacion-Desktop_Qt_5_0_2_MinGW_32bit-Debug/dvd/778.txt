 "Touring is an emotional rollercoaster"...wow guys, tell me something that Steve Perry didn't cover about twenty years ago when Journey did their own 'my life on the road is hard", video. blah blah blah. If you're looking for new ideas or insights you aren't going to find them here. If you are looking for any visual stimulation besides the "random town through window" b-roll, good luck. I admit, I love their music and, in print, Deathcab interviews well...but this little filmstrip fails to capture either very well. Which probably is less of a critique on the band than the film-maker/editor. (Who knows what a better cutter might have come up with.) On the PRO side, they did shoot it all in 16mm and some of the extras (the Lightness demo in particular) are excellent. Buy their music? YES, see them live? - YES. Buy this DVD? Only if you want something to half-watch while your doing your taxes.
