 This is a lovely production, intimate rather than stupendous. The sets, costumes, direction.... okay, the orchestra isn't the Met's, the singers are not seasoned, but altogether, this bunch makes an Aida better than the Met video with Domingo and Millo. I missed the elephants in that one, but I didn't even miss the horses in this one. Moreoever, the horses and chariots in the Met performance were the same, merely going round and round.LOL What was touching was that no one was singled out for curtain calls, the cast, et al. appearing as a group. There was one stand-out singer, Kate Aldrich, who sang Amneris. Scott Piper's Radames and Adina Aaron's Aida just couldn't really compare with the the gloriouis voice of Aldrich. Scott and Aaron will grow, but I doubt they'll ever make it into celebrated singers. Interestingly enough, those three are Americans -- what? -- Bergonzi couldn't find any Italians? Never mind, this is a wonderful experience and I gave it five stars because it was the little engine that did. Nancy Ecker
