 This is a riveting movie staring Kevin Costner as an Emergency Room doctor who's wife, also a doctor, has died in a terrible accident overseas helping the poor. No spoiler there since her death occurs at the start of the movie. He is crushed by the death of his wife and goes through the motions of his life like a robot. Remembering that his wife asked him to check in on her pediatric cancer patients, he begins to visit them and grows to appreciate his wife's love and commitment even more than before. Then things begin to happen. The children he sees have seen her in near death experiences. He doesn't believe it. He doesn't believe in very much anymore and at first dismisses what these young children are trying to tell him. I won't say more as it would likely ruin the movie experience for you. I'll just say that this is an insightful, deeply moving story that will leave you thinking for days. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I highly recommend that you not only see this movie, but buy it as you will want to watch it more than once.
