 Can you keep a secret? I love the OC. I'm a 28 year old man who has been infatuated with the stupid plots, inane dialog, and ridiculous characters this show has to offer. This season is absolutely NOT a let down. The only problem I can think of is that there isn't enough Seth Cohen. Aside from that, the show delivers exactly what it promises. While I will admit that this is no season 1, I would say that its actually better than season 2. The other reviewers may have been expecting some ground-breaking, innovative television experience, but that is insane. This is the freaking OC people! The show isn't "Masterpiece Theater" it's about rich kids and a flock of ever-changing ancillary characters finding themselves in impossible situations week after week. If you are thinking about this purchase, then you've seen the previous seasons and know what to expect. I am here to reassure you that its OK to pull the trigger on this one; you won't regret it. Oh, and be carefull, some of the other reviews give away the ending which is a total A-hole move
