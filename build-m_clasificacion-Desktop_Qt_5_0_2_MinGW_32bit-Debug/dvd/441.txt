 I usually don't care much to write a review on products that I buy, but I thought that I would on this one because I am so happy with my purchase. I have been working out to pilates on and off for the past year, and I am more in shape and toned now from working out this dvd for about 4 weeks than ever before. In fact, I now have 4-pack abs. My friends thought that I shelled out some serious money on a personal trainer when they saw me in a bikini. So for those of you who are already in shape somewhat, you will definitely see results in about 4 weeks. As for arms and legs, I supplement the work out to this dvd to also running and working out at the gym so i can't give this dvd all the credit for my arms and legs, but I can with my abs, because I have dropped everthing else I do for abs since I bought this dvd. I would definitely recommend purchasing of this dvd.
