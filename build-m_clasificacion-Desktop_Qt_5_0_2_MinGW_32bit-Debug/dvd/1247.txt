 '16 blocks' is basically a modernized 'The Gauntlet' with Bruce Willis. The Gauntlet P.O.: A hard but mediocre cop is assigned to escort a prostitute into custody from Las Vegas to Phoenix, so that she can testify in a mob trial. But a lot of people are literally betting that they won't make it into town alive 16 Blocks P.O.: An aging cop (Willis) is assigned the ordinary task of escorting a fast-talking witness (Def) from police custody to a courthouse. There are however forces at work trying to stop prevent them from making it. I love it. Everything about the film is great. Great opening and ending. Powerful performances and surprises. I'm actually at a loss for words right now, but I can say, pick this up instead of a mystery movie that you know nothing about. Take my word for it. Great cop action with Mos Def to boot. 4 of 5. Short review.
