 I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, "I want to do that, too!" Chayanne, who is probably a superstar in latin circles, gives a utilitarian acting performance, however appealing his personality, and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender, however, I reiterate, the dance sequences are exilerating. A solid family movie, and with the popularity of "Dancing With the Stars," should be a must-see for fans of that show
