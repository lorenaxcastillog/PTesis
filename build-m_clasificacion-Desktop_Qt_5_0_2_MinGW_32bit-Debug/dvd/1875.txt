 Chobits is another fine anime series from the CLAMP group who has been known for their works like xxxholic, cardcaptors sakura, angelic layer and other notable titles. I usually feel that after I once see an episode of a certain new series (the first episode obviously), I have the idea of how the anime really is. Well, I have been proven wrong on certain occasions but this time, I was right on spot. After renting volume one of the series on blockbuster, I actually bought the "Chobits complete collection", and boy believe me, I was not a bit disappionted. The series is full of comedy, romance, drama and so-called fantasy. The main characters are just too cute (I especially adore Chi and Sumomo). There are tons more cute persocoms around, so what is there not to like? The Set comes up with eight DVDs in 4 cases, the first six containing most of the contents. The final two are recaps of previous episodes, and a CD compilation respectively. Overall, this anime is a "complete satisfaction guaranteed" creation. It was a 675 minutes well spent
