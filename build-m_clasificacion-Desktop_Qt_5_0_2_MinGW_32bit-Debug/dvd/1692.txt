 First things first---Harry Potter isn't just for children. He belongs to a mythic tradition as old as King Arthur and as new as Luke Skywalker, with such notables as Oliver Twist, Huckleberry Finn and Dorothy Gale in between--all of them orphans whose adventures teach us something about life, loyalty, and what it means to be a hero. This collection of four film is a fine introduction to the mythology of Harry and Hogwarts, and gives viewers a chance to see its very young stars grow up. Not since the glory days of MGM have such novice performers and seasoned veterans worked together so seamlessly. Sure, there's plenty of magic going on via special effects-- Buckbeak the hippogriff being a special wonder, but just as magical are the performances of the human actors--seasoned pros like Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, plus newcomers like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and especially Rupert Grint, as fine a comic actor as any working today. This eight-disc collection (one for each film, plus a disc of extras) is a tremendous bargain. If you love movie magic in any sense of the word, this is for you.
