 I had never watched this series before I ordered the first disc on Netflix. I quickly became obsessed and ordered the whole season on DVD. This season is (finally) reasonably priced and worth every penny. I never thought that I would be so involved in a show about the lives of gay men (and two lesbians). The way this season ends is powerful and it picks up in season two right where it left off. I'm not emotional when it comes to t.v. shows, but QAF knows how to push your buttons. Whether or not it is an accurate depiction of gay life, I really can't say. I do know that not every show with straight characters is reflective of my life, so I'm not sure that matters. Once you get past some of the very raw scenes (and they make sure that happens pretty quickly) you become involved in everything the characters go through.
