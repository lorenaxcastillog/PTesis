 What makes such an impact here is that it's not that far fetched. My ex-brother-in-law was just like Mark Wahlbergs charactor. He was abusive and manipulitive and downright aggresive, overly protective/controling and jealous beyond no end. That to me is what makes this movie so scary (not really scary but intence)...it's very close to home and very real. This could happen, this does happen because there are people that are really like this. Mark Wahlberg plays the perfect psycho, all sweet on the outside but you can see through it. That was my brother-in-law. You almost wonder why they bother to pretend because it's so obvious you can see through the fasade. Too bad Reese couldn't (then again neither could me sister)...Teenage girls beware...just because he says nice things to you and you lost your virginity to him doesn't mean you should forgive him when he punches your friend in the face and tries to kill you family. Very well acted on all fronts with a tightly wound believable script. Recomended
