 First of all, this movie really appeals to me since I grew up in the South and can relate to many aspects of the movie. I love the mother-daughter bonding and sisterhood elements, and I LOVE the music. I loved the Cajun music (real Cajun folk music, not zyedeco), and "Selah" by Lauryn Hill just couldn't be a better fit. I don't know why some thought it was boring; I could watch it almost everyday. I think they could've done more research on the local accents...but I've seen very few Southern-themed movies that are even close to accurate sounding...c'est la vie. Yes, you hear the infamous, overused "r" dropping and slow Forrest Gump speech, but I digress. If you can get past that, you see some truly remarkable, beautiful women that all women, no matter what locale, can relate to. I've always adored Sandy Bullock, and Ellen Burstyn is superb. The casting is excellent, as they found actresses who not only fulfilled their roles spectacularly but also favored their older and younger counterparts. The movie deviates from the book quite a bit, but remains true to the spirit of the book. A must-see for women everywhere
