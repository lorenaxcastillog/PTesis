 Swedish immigrants move to Denmark in search of a better life in the land of riches and find themselves facing the same crap as Mexicans in the USA, Filipinas in Hong Kong, etc. Mostly, we focus on an old widower (Max von Sydow) and his young son, portrayed by a very talented actor we've never heard of. We get a full cast of characters, each with his or her own story, and we get to know them. Authenticity was sought and achieved. It was a little slow getting started, I admit, but since it clocks in at 2.5 hours, so what? What's your hurry? It's a fine film and I enjoyed watching it. I'd also like to mention that it was made in 1987. Just in case you watch it. There's a little scene that may remind my American readers of Lorena Bobbitt. The film came first. 1987. Life imitates art. Or something.
