 The bad news is, of course, that Peter Sellers died shortly after making this film. The good news is that he finished the film first. I had always believed, since his days in THE PARTY, that Sellers was a highly nuanced actor, with more authority and talent that he was often given credit for, in part due to his love of---and great skill at---farce. BEING THERE is a classic vindication, proving once and for all what a very great acting talent Sellers possessed. It had been several years since I'd watched the movie. I found a DVD that I'd gotten for Christmas and watched it yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was as good, or perhaps better, than I remembered. Every actor is centered and believable. There is great humor involved and applied most subtly. Sorry if it sounds maudlin but I think a very good adjective might be that the film is "sweet." Of course the best moral is the one that each viewer draws individually, but this is a rare film in that it gives us the option of walking away thinking about what we've just seen
