 Great John Wayne movie! I first saw this movie as a kid in the late 60's and I've seen it countless times since. Great action and great message for the times when it came out. It took The Duke to make a film about 'Nam during 'Nam to portray the war in a patriotic manner! If by chance you've not seen this film, don't let the naysayers steer you away from it with their sundry complaints! This is a great action movie and lots of fun for those who appreciate such classics! Here is something to watch for in the film that most probably missed: when Wayne picks up the M16 rifle from his fallen friend and says something like "He got 'em all, or they wouldn't have left this..." and then breaks the rifle against a tree---look closely at the rifle as he holds it...it is a Mattel toy M16 that he breaks---you can see the speaker slots on the side of the magazine! Great stuff! This film belongs in every buffs dvd collection, especially if you grew up during 'Nam and listened to Okie from Muskogee
