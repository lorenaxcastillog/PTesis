 This season really hit me hard There are so many issues So much sadness, hurt and pain That I ran out of tissues At first I thought it very dark And just a little boring But by disc two I watched all night Which led to work time snoring I can't believe Tina and Bette Can't sit and talk things out Instead of love, that little babe Just sees them fight and shout My favorite girl from Season 2 My Helena, so strong Now puts her trust in Tarot cards But still things all go wrong I hurt when Shane and Carmen fight I cry when Alice cries I puzzle over Jenny's life I mourn when someone dies New characters fall into place There's Moira, call me Max There's Angus and there's Dylan As the chart lines wane and wax There's Henry and there's Billie And of course there's always Kit By the time you get to Gabriel You're mentally unfit There's so much more to Season 3 Than what you've seen before I'm sitting waiting anxiously To order Season 4 Amanda Richards, November 10, 2006
