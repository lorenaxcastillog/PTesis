 One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed
