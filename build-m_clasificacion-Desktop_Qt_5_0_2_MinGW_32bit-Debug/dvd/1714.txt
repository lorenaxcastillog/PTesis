 A life packed with details such as Bobby Kennedy's is difficult to squeeze into only 2 hours (for instance, there is no mention of his living in England as a boy when old Joe was ambassador to the Court of St. James or that he had a brief stint in the Navy before going on to Harvard and Law School --serving on the Joseph P Kennedy Jr, the ship named after his fallen older brother). But these events are pale in comparison to the Bobby Kennedy that is presented here. It is honest in that it doesn't try to gloss over the much harder and meaner Bobby who existed prior to November 22, 1963. And post 1963 Bobby is a treat for those of us who love him and realize on a daily basis how unfortunate our country is to have lost him.
