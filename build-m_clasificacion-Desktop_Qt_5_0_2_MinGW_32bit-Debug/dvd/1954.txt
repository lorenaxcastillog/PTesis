 This is such a tragic, beautiful film. Langorous in its pacing, the film is told mainly through imagery, and evocative use of Mahler's 5th Symphony, 4th movement. It's almost like a tone poem, or a concerto itself, as it gives the viewer a true sense of sadness and death. Bogarde is superb as the dying composer, and the cinemtography is stunning. I would disagree that Bogarde's character is a homosexual who is lusting after the boy (some have said this just on the basis that Visconti was homosexual). Having read the novella this is based on, Bogarde's character sees in Tadzio the classical sense of beauty and truth, not sexual longings. He sees him as the perfect example of youth, but that doesn't necessarily mean he "wants" him. Some have called this film and the novella an advertisement for pedophilia, and that is grossly unfair and ridiculous. Thomas Mann is one of my favorite writers, and Visconti has made a film worthy of the original text. This is my favorite Visconti film, slightly ahead of The Leopard (the uncut version, of course).
