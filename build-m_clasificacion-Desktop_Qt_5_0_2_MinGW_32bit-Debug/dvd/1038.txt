 It really is! I think everyone has that one movie they never tire of watching whether it's an Oscar winner or not and this is mine. When life gets me down I can pop this DVD in and get lost in this wonderful haunted castle. No other movie I've found has so much &quot;castle&quot; ambiance. I love the large cast as well, only wish more time was spent portaying the wacky Irish staff. Watching it for the first time on my 60&quot; widescreen was a double delight in that all the background detail unnoticed on a smaller set becomes evident, adding new dimension to the film. I even plan on visiting Castle Dromore someday which is the castle this movie was set in. It really is a shame that Neil Jordan's career began a downward spiral after this movie was released with such terrible reviews. Gutenberg and Hannah were probably the real reasons for the bad reviews, not the direction. Luckily he made a comeback years later with another favorite of mine, Interview with a Vampire. Any fan of castles or 80's comedy will really enjoy this one
