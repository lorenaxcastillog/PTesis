 After his singing career began to wane, Frank Sinatra began his meteoric rise in the movies. One of his best comedic roles was in the musical Guys and Dolls. But here's another little-seen gem, a Frank Sinatra sleeper that many viewers have caught bits of but which only recently appeared on DVD. After seeing this film, I tried to track it down, not knowing the name of it, and finally found it in Leonard Maltin's film guide (check out his review). They don't make movies like this anymore. That overused cliche is an understatement for this film where everything works, especially the chemistry between Sinatra and Eleanor Parker, but the show stealer is his twelve year old son, Ally, who takes care of the always drinking, always dreaming Sinatra. Edward G. Robinson tries to straighten him out, at bottom still believing in him. If you're wondering if Capra ever made anything as endearing as It's a Wonderful Life, yes he did, and here it is, a great family film now on DVD.
