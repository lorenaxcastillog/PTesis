 Memento is a movie you have to watch again to fully understand the roots of the story behind Lenard Shelby (Guy Pierce) and his relationships with Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) & Teddy/John Gamel (Joe Pantoliano). Lenard has a condition in this movie where he has no short-term memory (not amnesia though). He can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he needs/wants to remember and for the important things, he has them tattooed on his own body. He is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture (won't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested) of Teddy shot in the head, but you don't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in 10-12 minute sequences then moving into no-color sequences where Lenard talks more about his condition. Be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it. Overall, great movie
