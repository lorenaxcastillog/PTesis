 What a movie! Like Super-Size Me, An Inconvenient Truth, and Fahrenheit 9/11 , this one pulls at your intellect and gut to see many heros and villains, and expect justice. The premise? GM and other car manufacturers were making fully functional, 100% electric cars less than a decade ago. Then, with the California Air Resources Board decision to withdraw the requirement that 5-10% of cars sold in California pass the zero emissions test, and a possible behind the scenes conspiracy with a variety of players promoting the California Fuel Cell Partnership, the EV-1 and other electric cars die, literally. Hundreds of fully functioning cars were smashed and shredded. Zero of these original cars are on the road today. Zero! They had all been leased, and the auto companies called them all to car heaven, even though the folk leasing them offered cash to keep them. Do not let a single politician be elected without clarifying their role in this debacle. Never let your concerns for global warming, human health, and national security be held ransom by the gas and automobile cartels. It's up to you
