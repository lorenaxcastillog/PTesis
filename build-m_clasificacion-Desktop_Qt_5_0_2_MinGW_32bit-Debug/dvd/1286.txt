 JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD isn't quite as bad as a lot of reviewers say, although they certainly are entitled to their opinions---isn't that what this site's all about? At any rate, while the sequel loses some of its originality and awe-inspiring moments, it does well as an action film, with the T rexs attacking the trailer a nail-biting sequence. There's a lot of predictability in the scientists vs. the hunters formula, but in a film like this, one can accept predictablility if it's handled professionally. And the effects and camera work are par excellence. As in the first film, Jeff Goldblum underplays his role, perhaps a bit too much this time---he almost seems bored? Julianne Moore who was to go on to more "acting" roles is okay as the heroine, a little more exciting than Laura Dern. I too agree with the decision to go politically correct and give Goldblum an African-American daughter, especially since there's no background to add to this relationship. Pete Postelthwaite and Arliss Howard as the villains were appropriately cast. While not as big a hit as its prequel, LOST WORLD entertained me
