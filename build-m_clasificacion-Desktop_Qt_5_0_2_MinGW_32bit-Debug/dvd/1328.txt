 I became a Beatle fan thanks to my mother. She had told me for years how good the movie "Help!" was. Finally, she found the DVD and bought it. I was an instant fan! Help!, one of the DVD's included in this set is a thoroughly delightful movie with a fantastic soundtrack. Anyone with a love for British comedy will also love this movie. Also included with this set is Magical Mystery Tour, You Can't Do That!: The Making of A Hard Day's Night and The Beatles: The First US Visit. All three, combined with Help!, are well worth the cost of this four DVD set. MPI Video who held the rights to the Beatles DVD's stopped selling them as of January 1, 2001. That is such a sad thing because there is so much entertainment contained in this set and in all Beatles movies. I highly recommend searching for this title through online auctions or other avenues. You will not be disappointed with The Ultimate Collection!
