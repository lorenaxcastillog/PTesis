 "Seven Days In May" has an impressive cast list, great direction, and a screenplay written by Rod Serling. For the MTV generation, this would probably be very boring as it relies on insightful realistic dialog and some powerful non-jerking camera-work to tell a great story. Burt Lancaster is Kirk Douglas' superior officer in the same military outfit, and Douglas suspects Lancaster is up to something secret and no good. The relationship and animosity between them is powerful and convincing as the story unfolds and the secret slowly comes out. Frederic March plays a convincing president who at first is cautiously suspicious, then grows more determined as the movie reaches its climax. The three or four supporting roles are handled superbly as well. I guess it would fit into the category of "political thriller", and goes well with the other 3 major cold-war era movies - "Dr. Strangelove" (satire), "Fail Safe" (drama), and "The Manchurian Candidate" (drama, also directed by John Frankenheimer). The DVD includes an entertaining commentary. An all-around well-done movie that goes in my top 20 for sure.
