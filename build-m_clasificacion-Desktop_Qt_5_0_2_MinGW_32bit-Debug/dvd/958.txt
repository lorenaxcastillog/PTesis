 It's Alive is a Classic B movie from the 70's. What's it about? Two words: Killer Baby. Despite you ever getting a chance to see the baby, it's a rather interesting film that is done pretty well. Take this movie for what it is. It's a B movie with good acting, hilarious storyline, yet manages to take itself seriously. I was surprised by this film. I thought it would have been pure crap, but it was carried out rather well and seriously. I really enjoyed the movie as I am sure others do too. I wouldn't advise buying this movie though, just rent it instead or get it for a cheap price. It's not a film you will watch often, but you will find yourself telling your friends about it. Rent it, laugh a bit, and enjoy it. I sure did. My favorite scene was when the killer baby attacks the milkman, it's awesome.
