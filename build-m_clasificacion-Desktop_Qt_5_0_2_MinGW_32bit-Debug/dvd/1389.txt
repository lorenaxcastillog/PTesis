 Stepmom can be slated by people who don't have a heart, but this is one of the best Julia Roberts movies out there. Ed Harris, Susan Sarandon & Julia all do extremely well in this, as do the kids. Jena Malone plays the little girl, and Liam Aiken (Object Of My Affection, Sweet November) plays her younger brother. I have to say this movie makes me cry every single time. And once you've seen the movie once, you'll start crying earlier & earlier in the movie each time. It's amazing. Julia & Susan work so well on this film together, that I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. Their love/hate relationship is so good, you actually believe it. The cold stares (something Susan's fabulous at!) make you shiver. And the crying, god, as soon as they start, that's me. Watch out for the conversation about the wedding, if that doesn't get you going nothing will. This is a truly excellent film, and I'm not going to ruin it anymore for anyone who hasn't seen it. Just make sure the tissues are filled up, and you're either wearing waterproof mascara or none at all
