 I originally bought this DVD for my sister, she just had her first child, and she is an avid exerciser. She loved it and recommended I purchase a copy for myself, as I am always struggling with how to find the time to exercise between work, volunteering, and my 2 small children. I am totally in love with the program. Since my kids are out of strollers, they bike while I walk with them. They actually look forward to mommy doing her "exercises" on the TV. My 6 year old likes to join in, while my 3 year old is entranced by the images that bounce across the screen. We've even created a game where they have a list of all the figures, and they try to check them off when they see them (this helps with reading skills, a BONUS!) I find the exercises challenging and adaptable. I am very happy with me purchase, and I recommend Strollertime to ALL moms, not just those with babies
