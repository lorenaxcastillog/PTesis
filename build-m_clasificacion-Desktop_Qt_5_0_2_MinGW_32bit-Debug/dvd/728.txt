 Newman, Redford, Robert Shaw as the bad guy, twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so...how can anyone not like "The Sting"? When I saw it on the big screen upon its first release, I did not think it deserved the Oscar as best film of its year, although I enjoyed it. Now, decades later, and after having seen it perhaps 20 times, at least in pieces, I think it one of the best achievements in movie-making in its century. It has STYLE, and a consistent sensibility, and logic, and on first viewing, it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top. I can't imagine that anyone over 30 hasn't seen it yet, but if that's you, fix it as soon as possible. It is a primer in how to write, direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience. Newman's drunken card-player on the train with Shaw is absolutely classic
