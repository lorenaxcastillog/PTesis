 One of the labels for this Anchorman DVD labels the edition as "uncalled for", and I couldn't agree more- this movie was completely uncalled for and unnecessary. In an edition of GameInformer magazine, Reiner and Joe recalled a conversation they had in which it took them several hours to "regain normal higher-level brain functions" after an unfortunate run-in at the movie theaters between them and Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne; I hate to say it, but I feel the same way about this movie. This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour. The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby. Anchorman really wasn't that interesting, I laughed at maybe one joke in the movie, and overall I hated the experience. Good thing I watched it at a friend's house and not at the theaters- otherwise, I'd have to demand my money back
