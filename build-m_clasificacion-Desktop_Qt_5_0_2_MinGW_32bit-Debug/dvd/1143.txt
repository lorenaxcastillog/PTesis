 I got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic -- the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college. Good grief. Since when is a musical ever realistic?? Especially one that is geared to kids. Hello??!! It's not supposed to be realistic! If you expect realism, go elsewhere. But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie. Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I've talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks. I love it! I can't even begin to say how much better this is than "Grease," the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be "happy." Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from "Highschool Musical.
