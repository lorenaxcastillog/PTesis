 Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today.
