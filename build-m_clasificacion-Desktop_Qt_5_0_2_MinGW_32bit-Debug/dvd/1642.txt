 [star rating above is for DVD only (gave them an extra * just for releasing the title); movie itself = *****] I've waited 7 years for this Sidney Lumet masterpiece to appear on DVD. The transfer here is non-anamorphic, non-progressive 1.66:1. Cruddy. 12 total chapter stops for a 2-hour film. my review of the new "Burn!" DVD asks consumers to please send Sony/Columbia/Tristar/MGM a clear message by not purchasing that disc. In this case - as we've all waited so long just to have a widescreen transfer of "TFK" appear on disc - it's up to you. With the advent of the year 2006 I'll be seeking a special edition of "The Fugitive Kind" (and other MIA Lumet gems such as "The Hill", "The Offence", "The Anderson Tapes" ...) for DVD release by a studio which treats classic films with the respect, archival care, detail attention and extras they deserve
