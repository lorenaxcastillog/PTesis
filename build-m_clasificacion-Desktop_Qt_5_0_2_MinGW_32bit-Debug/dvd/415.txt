 The series starts right where the last one left off. For those new to Ghost in the Shell universe it works like this... - Ghost in the Shell (Movie) which launched it all. - Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (Movie) the sequel to the first movie. - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (Seven Volume series on DVD available for purchase here on amazon in a box set) - Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2nd GIG (Basically season 2) The movies have the same characters, but the storyline and arcs are different from the series. The second season, or 2nd GIG, delivers more of what GITS fans want including the great soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. The music from the series is definately a big part of the series and the opening title music is just as good as the original. We welcome back the entire cast in the 2nd season and introduce several developing plotlines in the first four episodes. From watching the first four episodes it looks like we are in for more great animation/storytelling from the creaters of the 1st season
