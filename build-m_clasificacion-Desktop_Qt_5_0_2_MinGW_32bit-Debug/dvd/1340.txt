 This movie teaches us a lot about love and life and the value of life at all age levels, and how precious one's mind and memory is. And, I know it's cliche, but 'sometimes you hurt the one's you love most.' Winslett and Dench are mesmorizing. I agree with reviewer Mary Whipple on how the director very effectively goes back and forth in time: "Alternating between present and past, director Eyre develops innumerable visual parallels, showing Murdoch as a wild young girl (passionately played by Kate Winslett), uninhibitedly exploring every aspect of life, with Dench repeating similar scenes (such as the swimming scenes) late in life. The young John Bayley (Hugh Bonneville) plays his role so close in style to Broadbent that except for the obvious age differences, they could well be the same person, both blushing on cue. These four brilliant actors are completely successful in merging time frames to create two complete characters--Iris Murdoch and John Bayley."
