 I generally admire Jennifer Aniston's work so I picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn. Sadly, watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie. If you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes, you would't miss much since nothing really happens. If it's a comedy, it isn't funny. If it's a slice of life, the lives are deadly dull. The emotional level is so low-key you suspect the entire group is on valium. Jenifer Aniston especially, seems to have phoned this one in. Real characters? As it happens, I've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these sad-sack characters. If they're actually representative of real Americans then we're in big trouble! My wife & I had the same reaction at the end of this one ..... "THAT"S IT??!!"
