 Overall very good season, isn't as good as season 3 due to the lack of effort on Depp's part. The one thing that they did with the dvd that disappointed me was that they removed the song With or Without You by U2 from the episode La Bizca, and replaced it with some generic song. That song really made the scenes in this episode very emotional, this new generic song, however, doesn't do that at all. I was very disappointed as I have been waiting for the episode for a while. Oh well what can you do. This dvd claims to have every episode from season 4, but in reality they only have 25. They put in Wheels and Deals part 1 which was actually an episode from the spinoff show Booker (Dennis). They also axed the last episode of season 4 (though not the last episode filmed in order) Blackout, which was also Depp's last show. I'm guessing that they are gonna put it in the season 5 dvd to capitalize on Depp. Oh well. All in all a good set just wish they hadn't made those pointless changes
