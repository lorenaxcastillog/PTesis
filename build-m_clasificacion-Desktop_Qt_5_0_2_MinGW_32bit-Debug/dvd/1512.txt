 I can go on and on about how ground-breaking and exceptional Batman: The Animated Series is, but many of the reviews in the following pages do a pretty good job of covering that. So, the concise version: -First 28 episodes in production order. Some come off as a little rough (Joker's personality isn't as defined) and there are a few clunkers, but most are great fun and there are lots of classics (introductions to Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Clayface, the pilot episode). -Bonus features include 2 commentaries, retrospective featurette, and the original pilot animation used to pitch the series. Not a lot in terms of quantity, but the retrospective packs in a lot of surprise interviews from staff, voice talent, and comic artists. Great stuff. -Suitable for all ages. Stories are well-written, voice-acting is excellent, high production values and love for source material. Violence could be somewhat intense for younger viewers, but is tastefully handled. A great addition to any dvd library, whether for the kids or for yourself. The pinnacle of modern animation, and a defining take on Batman. Highly recommended.
