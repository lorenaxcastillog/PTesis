 "Wag the Dog" is a scathing parody of how politicians manipulate the media to mold public opinion and sentiment. Briefly, the President (think: Clinton)is accused of molesting a "Firefly" girl (think: Monica) and his main "behind the scenes" political operative (think:Karl Rove) hires a Hollywood producer to create a war with Albania to distract the public. It's hard to believe that this film was made in 1997, before the Clinton impeachment, and even harder to believe that the film was made long before the Iraq war. Remember the famous "hostilities are over" media event when Bush landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier? When was that? Three years ago? It's hard to beat this star-studded cast: deNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson, Kirsten Dunst (in a bit role), and a hysterically funny Willie Nelson. This is a film that has gotten even more relevant and pointed since its release--a rare thing. I would give this a 4 1/2 if I could because the plot line drags a bit at times--but I howled with laughter at the "production" numbers and the Willie Nelson songs. Highly recommended
