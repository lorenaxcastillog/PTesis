 Werner Herzog has made another utterly original movie. I don't even know how to catagorize this film. It's partly an exploration of the nature of obsession, partly a wildlife documentary, partly an aviation documentary, and partly a call home from a man who misses his family. Obstensibly, it's about a scientist who is haunted by the death of his friend in a South American rainforest airship accident, and goes back to the rainforest to fly a new airship over the canopy. But Herzog appears to be figuratively panning the camera in all directions, and the movie goes in several directions simultaneously. The effect is a visually gorgeous film that not only explores the landscape of the rainforest, but also of human emotion. At one point Herzog is able to film the secret nesting place of a huge swift colony. Herzog shows the local chief explaining that showing the nesting grounds to others will bring disaster--and then leaves the actual footage of the nests out of the picture! Wow. I loved this film.
