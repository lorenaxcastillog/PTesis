 Without a doubt, Dave Chappelle created one of the greatest shows to air on television, but I might just be saying too much...or not. Everything he does will crack you up and if it doesn't you have no sense of humor. While I don't have the first season yet, I have seen the whole thing, and it is worth the purchase 100%. Dave Chappelle isn't a blind comedian who let's power get in his way. He knows what's best for him and that is another reason why he is one of the best comedians in America today. There are many hilarious sketches that somehow were beat by the next season, but that's no reason to skip this set! This contains all the episodes fully uncensored, as we want them and funny as h e l l commentary by Dave and Neal. There are also bonus features that need your attention. There is no thinking over to do, go buy it now
