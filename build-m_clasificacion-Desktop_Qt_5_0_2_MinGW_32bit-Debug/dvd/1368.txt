 I rented this a long time ago with little expectations. I was very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Peck plays Father Fancis Chisolm. The begining is hilarious when you hear what counsel he gave a heavy set woman in his congregation. The movie starts at the end of his life and as another priest comes and reads his diary, his whole life is unfolded. What a rough life, but what a good man! If you love good old fashioned movies with a moral to the story, you will love this one. Peck plays the under dog. A man who is very humble. This movie will make you laugh, cry, angry, etc. Has it all! Great christian flick! Glad to see it finally out on DVD. Great movie for the whole family to watch together. I would give it more stars if I could. Another good movie from a Christian perspective is "Stars In My Crown". Hope that comes out on DVD soon!!
