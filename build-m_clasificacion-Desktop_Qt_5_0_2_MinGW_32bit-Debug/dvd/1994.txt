 I was too young to see "LIZA WITH A Z." And I believe everything from the "artistic packaging," to the "extras" to the performance itself is "PERFECT!" If I have ONE COMPLAINT is though I have a 38 inch television it only PLAYS FULL SCREEN AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD to "WIDE SCREEN." And in certain sections it is "slightly grainy." But that did NOT stop me from giving it a perfect rating because what I saw was a "perfect performance" and a lot of hard work and time put into giving this gift for all of us! I'm so overwhelmed that "magical" is all that I can think of. Also, anyone doubting Liza'a looks just see this performance for she is "HOT!" If you love theatre and you want to learn something while also enjoying it then all you need to do is buy or rent (you'll wnat to own it) "LIZA WITH A Z"
