 Seen this movie three time and each time find something new to enjoy.A brief resume of the story is :wife's dream world and marital bliss is shattered by husband disapearance from their boat during an idyllic holiday.She is accused of murder and being found guilty ends in jail.She misses her little boy and after her parole tries to unravel the mysery of her husband disapearence.Her parole officer(Tommy Lee Jones in a role similar to the Fugitive and The Marshalls) is on her trail after she escapes and she always one step ahead of capture.I also liked New Orleans locations.Was lucky to visit the city over ten years ago,so I enjoyed the locale for the scenes where she finally comes face to face with her "dead" husband. And the thrill continues as he tries to kill her.Right until the last frame you are bound to sit on the edge of the chair!As good a thriller as the Pelican Brief.Milli
