 Oscar winning director Ridley Scott helms a crafty little con movie in MATCHSTICK MEN. Fellow Oscar winner Nicolas Cage gives a tight, well nuanced performance as con artist Roy who is running a good con business with his partner Frank (a good performance from Sam Rockwell), when he suddenly connects with the fourteen year old daughter he never knew. Alison Lohman is perfect as the older than her years Angela, who seems to have a knack for her dad's profession. Cage also suffers from a severe obsessive compulsive disorder and has some good scenes with his shrink, nicely underplayed by Bruce Altman. Good support as well from Bruce McGill as one mark who discovers their scam and Sheila Kelly as a grocery store clerk who has her eye on Cage. The movie has a leisurely feel, reminiscent of Scott's THELMA AND LOUISE, and a couple of twists at the end that I didn't see coming, although I should have! Suffice to say, MATCHSTICK MEN is an original movie, well done and recommended
