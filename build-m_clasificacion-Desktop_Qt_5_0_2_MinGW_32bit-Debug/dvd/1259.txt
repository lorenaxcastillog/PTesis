 BABY BOOM is a classic 80's comedy which capatalised on timely issues for women of the period, but remains a relevant and very funny movie. Diane Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt, a high-powered New York businesswoman, known as the Tiger-Lady, who "inherits" Elizabeth, the orphaned toddler of a long-forgotten distant cousin. J.C. valiantly tries to juggle Elizabeth with her hectic career before she's politely told to leave the office...for good. Undaunted, J.C. bundles up the baby and heads for Vermont, but it's not long until she starts climbing the corporate ladder once more... BABY BOOM attempts to answer the age-old question "Can women have it all?", and the entire film, whilst firmly-rooted in the world of 80's big-business and the consumer generation, still has a lot to offer viewers of a new century. Diane Keaton glows as J.C., a role she seems effortlessly suited to. The supporting cast (Sam Shepard, Harold Ramis, James Spader, Mary Gross and Sam Wanamaker) is first-rate. The pivotal role of baby Elizabeth is played by twins Kristina and Michelle Kennedy. Later spun-off into a television sitcom with Kate Jackson as J.C.; along with Sam Wanamaker and the Kennedy twins reprising their film roles
