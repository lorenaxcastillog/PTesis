 I like Glenn Gould. I didn't care for this movie however. 1) The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting. 2) Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life. One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations. Big deal, this is not interesting. I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking. Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady. Thats it. Why is this interesting? Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care? Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries. Now he is putting his change in his pocket. How utterly profound.... In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie
