 First off, this is a very wordy, wanna be woody allen type film, which means just not funny. In the trailer, they did pick a few of the humerous parts, but it just really isn't a comedy. Secondly, if the characters would just shut up once in a while and actually work on their problems (epecially jennifer aniston's character), then the characters would get things done in their lives. Therapy is what Aniston's character really needed, or a boot to the head. True friends would have gotten her help before she got to where she did in this film. There were parts that were amusing, because it depicted real life scenerios, and pointed out irony, but that gets old real quick. This movie did have a good cast, and a reasonable message that friends are what matter, and that true friendship comes easy by being yourself. That is what gets this film two stars. Rent this movie (don't buy it), but best if you borrow this from someone else who rents it. I only saw it because my wife rented it. You won't want to see it twice.
