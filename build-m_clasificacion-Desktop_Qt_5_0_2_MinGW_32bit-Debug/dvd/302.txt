 I have to say...I was a little weary when i decided to see this movie...alot of my friends raved about it, but im so picky, i didnt think id like it. so i watched it and i was blown away. i cried the first few times i saw it. I must've watched it about 10-20 times and i can never get enough. it is beautifully done. the music is excellent. the casting was clear perfection. i give props to the writer of the original play...what a masterpiece i could rave forever and ever about it. the storyline is such like todays life...paying rent sucks, and its nearly impossible to get good money around here. i could rant and rave for hours. all i have to say is, if you havnt seen it, it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15...the topics can get a little mature. but it really is worth it
