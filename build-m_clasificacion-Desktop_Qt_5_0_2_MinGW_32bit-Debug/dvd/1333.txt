 As other reviewers have discussed the film in good detail, I will just say I have always enjoyed Peyton Place. It is one of the few instances where the film rises over the material presented. However, I found the special features on the DVD to be very disappointing. The extra audio track is Russ Tamblyn and Terry Moore discussing the film (unfortunately most of the other stars are dead, so this is the best they could do). They are obviously not in the same room, so there is no interaction between them. Tamblyn's comments are okay, but Moore is constantly reminding us of the few high points of her so-so career. The other special feature is the show done by AMC's Hollywood Backstory on the film - and like other Backstory's, overly dwells with sensational tidbits (especially Lana Turner's ordeal when her daughter killed her mob boyfriend). Get the DVD for a good quality presentation of a favorite film, but not to learn anything substantive about it
