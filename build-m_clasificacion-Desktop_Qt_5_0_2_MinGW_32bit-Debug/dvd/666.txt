 Everyone is entitled to their own opinions first and foremost. I can understand why a lot of people are bashing this flick when it's obvious they failed to piece together that this movie is a documentary about a.... (are you ready?) BLOCK PARTY! Seems to me all the people who are giving this movie a 1 star review were expecting to see a live version of his show or maybe some stand-up. C'mon people the title says everything. It's a show Dave and many of his close jazzy underground hip-hop friends put on in BK to show love to the people. How can you bash that? When was the last time you seen an entertainer on the top of his game put on a free show with as many well known acts as he did just to show his fans that they're appreciated? I give this album a 4 star review for the simple fact that I don't think it's a perfect film. The acts were all on point in my humble opinion. If you like socially conscious hip hop then I think you'd enjoy this movie. Peace and Love
