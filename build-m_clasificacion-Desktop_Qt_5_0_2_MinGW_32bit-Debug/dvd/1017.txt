 I was worried about not liking this movie. I'd read a lot of Reviews that said it was weird or boring. But I love Joe Strummer so I had to check it out. and I was pleasantly surprized to find a quirky laugh out loud movie. IT Is a DARK comedy. and you'll either love it or hate it, get it or not. I only gave 4 stars because Courtney Love annoys me she's the only downside to the movie, but her part isn't hugh so it's bareable. I loved seeing Strummer playing a cool sexy guy, he had some great funny moments. Shane Macgowan made me crack up when ever he's on screen. I was also surprized to see some actors in it that are now recgnizable from their recent work like an actor from medium and one from 24. Give this movie a chance and you'll be rewarded
