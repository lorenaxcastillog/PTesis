 The technical excellence of this film on every level has already been sufficiently and deservedly documented many times over. There is so much to savor: every syllable and facial expression of Mr. Scofield, Wendy Hiller in her devastatingly real final departure from her husband in the Tower of London,--a scene so heart rippingly convincing that the viewer is nearly traumatized by the mere witness of it, as well as photography and production design that render the film's interiors as though they were painted by Vermeer. But all this is secondary to the film's powerful meaning, a meaning apparently lost, (or abandoned) in our inane, relativized, pop culture Oprah-ized delusional pursuit of "self-fullfillent". And that is, of course, that St. Thomas More must willingly give up his own life rather than publicly countenance a divorce, and thereby deny the Church. How very refreshing to hear heresy denounced by its rightful name in this film! Roman Catholics take note: absolute fidelity to the Primacy of Peter often requires nothing less than one's very life. The film should be required viewing for all catechumen
