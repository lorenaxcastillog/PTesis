 You know, usually I am a big fan of older movies as they were typically made better and had better writing, etc. One strong exception that I just watched was "King Solomon's Mines" from 1950. What a doggy movie! It makes even the lamest Disney movie watchable. Basically, it is "Hey, look at that animal!" and then a cut to some stock footage, except in one case where a giant rubber spider creature creeped along like a relative of "The Tingler". Star Stewart Granger also seemed to understand every African language dialect except when it was really important. And, there was also an emphasis on how much ammunition was left, so the final bullets were used on certain natives to great effect. Once they got to the mine itself, it was still snoresville and basically a letdown. This was made before in 1937 and again in 1985 and in 2004 which seemingly the same results according to other reviews. Why do they keep making this same stupid movie???
