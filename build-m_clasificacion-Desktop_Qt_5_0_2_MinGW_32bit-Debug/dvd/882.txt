 I can't even begin to describe how excellent this show is!!!!!!! The performances are soooo incredible. Brent Barrett and Rachel York are, as always just superb. Ms York as we all know is one of the most versatile performers toay, and this I believe is her best performance. She was bron to play Lilli, as was Mr. Barrett to play Fred. The singing is deffinately some of the best. Of course, nothing can beat the original with Patty Morison and the late Alfred Drake, but this is my second favorite. I prefer it to the Mazzie/Stokes Mitchell recording. I don't know, the singing seema stronger here. Also, you can see them as opposed to just hearing them. Brent is be-ootiful and taked hold of his character exceptionally well!!!!!!!! And Rachel is gorgeous, especially in the Wunderbar scene. She really has a demanding role, she must sing beautifully (which she REALLY does) scream her head off like a mad women (which she does EXCEPTIONALLY well) she must seem bossy, tyranical, tempermental, bossy, harsh, while also seeming vulnerable, wounded, and a bit frightened, and sad at times. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
