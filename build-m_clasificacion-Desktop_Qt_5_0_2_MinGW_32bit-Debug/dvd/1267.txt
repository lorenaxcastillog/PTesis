 I cannot comment on the DVD version as I just saw this movie last night on HBO. However, I throughly enjoyed it. It's a touching movie about a lonely career civil servant and a young woman starting her life over again. Although there are many differences between them: age, background, education, etc., loneliness is not one of them. My favorite scene is where Lawrence and Gina enter the pre-working dinner cocktail reception and he comments on his colleagues so as to reassure Gina - Perfect! The photography is beautiful of the lovely Icelandic scenery. The soundtrack is great and not overwhelming. As for the politics of the film, whether right or left wing, one cannot deny the existence of poverty, AIDS, etc and recognize Gina's sincere if naive desire to have these "impressive" diplomats do something more than edit some reports, sip champagne or debate - do something! Just sit back and appreciate this movie about two lonely people who meet and enjoy each other and treat the politics as a means to develop the two characters - not the raison d'etre.
