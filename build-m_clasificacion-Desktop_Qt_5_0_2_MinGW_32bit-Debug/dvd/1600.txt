 Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era. Luckally, I rented this from Blockbuster. The main story is good but the rest I have seen in other DVDs. I was hoping for alot of matches. It would take atleast 4-6 DVD discs full of matches to really go deep into Austin's history. But 1 disc is pathetic. I put shame on the WWE as they have no idea what fans want. This DVD was not even worth the rent. I am a horribly horribly dissapointed Stone Cold fan and wonder how the WWE could put out trash such as this. I hope the WWE releases a 3-6 DVD set on Stone Cold otherwise I hope the WWE goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion (WCW and ECW) and have no motivation to become better
