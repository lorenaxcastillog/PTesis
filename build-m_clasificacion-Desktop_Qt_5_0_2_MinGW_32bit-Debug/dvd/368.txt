 This DVD really lets you in on the insight of Jake Roberts. He was one of the most unique characters in his heyday and with his commentary on this it really stands out tremendously. The kind of things I learned from him (especially in his youth) and his drug and alcohol abuse, he grew up rough in every sense of the word. Now I have a better understanding of why/how he became bitter (at times). Overall, it's an excellent DVD that has most of his classic matches. When I first saw him get hit with the guitar by the Honky Tonk Man, I thought he was faking the shot to make it look real and I even laughed at it until he said that guitar was 1/2 inch thick and then I looked at the clip again and I thought damn, it really almost killed him. He had a lot of guts to continue to wrestle. That type of commentary along with other things he touched up on really gave it a sense of realism of the pro wrestling lifestyle. Overall, I recommend this DVD to add to your collection.
