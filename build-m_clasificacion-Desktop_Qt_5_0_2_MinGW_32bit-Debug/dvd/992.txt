 A thought came to me that if I were to put on a very limited showing of rock/pop films it might include The Beatles' Hard Day's Night, The Band's Last Waltz, then I thought why not this one to help encapsulate the feeling of the late 1970s. Filmed fantastically by Hallstrom (a major motion picture director ever since), with split screens and the whole thing, puts the viewer into the middle of the frenzy, the huge concerts, touring/meet-and-greet schedule, maniacal fans, etc. The concert footage is terrific, sound is excellent, plus the small handful of Australian actors are very memorable. I come across rock history buffs and musicians who still don't get the whole ABBA thing (this is coming from a guy who also listens to Sonic Youth, by the way), but perhaps this film will do it. Glad to see this on DVD - have been waiting a long time. Trust me, the energy in this is amazing
