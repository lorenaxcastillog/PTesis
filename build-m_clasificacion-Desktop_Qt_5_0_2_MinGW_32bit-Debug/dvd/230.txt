 I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that "La Boum" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through "La Boum" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. "La Boum" made an impact on us more than "Goodburger" or "Totoro" ever could.
