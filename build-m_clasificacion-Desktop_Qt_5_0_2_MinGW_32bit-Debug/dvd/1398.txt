 I have read all the reviews and they are mostly correct, so I will not go over territory covered. Nicholas Cage chose to sound like Gumby on purpose, much to the consternation of the rest of the cast I have read, but it was his uncle directing so it is what it is. All the other reviews are right--this is a very good film. What they forget to mention, however, is the incredible set design. Every small detail seems perfect--the houses, cars, knick-knacks, everything. Yes, the speakers in the basement scene are not yet invented--too bad they were as they are among the worst speakers ever made--but I believe a good bit of the charm of this film is the background. It sets the scenes and gives the actors an authentic backdrop for the story. Part of the enjoyment for those of us who lived then was the visual transcendence into the past that accompanied the script/plot. One reviewer got it right--it sometimes brings a tear to your eye
