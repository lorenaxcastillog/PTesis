 In between the poignant sex scenes between two obese amateur thespians (as husband and wife) and between the protagonist (Marcos Hernï¿½ndez), and the attractive hooker (Anapola Mushkadiz) - who so happens to be the daughter of a military official he works for, there are some scenes of deep confusion and contemplation. The cast are all non-actors, and it is evident. The "freshness" that Reygadas is going for is not really there - what we have in its place is just a sense that something is lacking. I tried to get it, but was left lost. In the scenes were Marcos walks or drives around staring blankly at things - one gets the sense that either the actor was lost or forgot his lines. The story lacked character development but to be fair the stream of consciousness left me thinking about the complexity of the human mind - but that is where it stopped. Am I curious to see Japon? Certainly - but my expectations have changed... who knows? Miguel Llor
