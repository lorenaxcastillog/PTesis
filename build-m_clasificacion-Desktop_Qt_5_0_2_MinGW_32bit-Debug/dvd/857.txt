 These shows are excellent capsules of the early 60's, featuring not just The Beatles, but Davy Jones (part of the Oliver! cast), Frank Gorshin (whom I remember better as "The Riddler" on Batman), Soupy Sales, Cab Calloway,etc. The point of sale, is of course, the 20 performances by The Beatles, presented in very good shape here (as opposed to the numerous copies of copies boots and chopped specials). The sound and pictures being from a 4-decade old videotape are better than expected, and kudos to whoever did the mastering. In other reviews, the other acts get panned, but they are good as well, Sullivan wasn't just a vaudeville rehash. Part of the problem with seeing the comedians,etc. now is that you need to know about the people being referred to (such as Allen and Rossi's bits with Sonny Liston and LBJ). Overall,well worth the price of admission for these trips back to 1964 and 1965
