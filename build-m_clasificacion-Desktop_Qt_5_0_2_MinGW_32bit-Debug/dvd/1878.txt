 I am sure there was an agenda before their film was made. But what ever it was is lost in inconsistent and repetitious interview style questions. I did like the calendar girls; I did not realize you could get such calendars. The militia looked like a neat organization. When they do interviews with Canadians for contrast I thought I was watching "Canadian Bacon" with John Candy. They did mention nukes but did not go to the other extreme and count how many people were knifed and hacked (Lizzy Borden) due to the absence of a proper firearm. No mention of the fact than Kung Fu is necessary so one can kill when deprived of proper defensive devices. They seem to be fascinated with Charlton Heston. "Home of the brave and Land of the free"; his presents is peppered throughout the film. I suspect that the title comes from the fact that the students in Columbine went bowling before their spree.
