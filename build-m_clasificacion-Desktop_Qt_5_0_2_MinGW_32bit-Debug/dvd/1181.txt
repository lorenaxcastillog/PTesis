 I read some of the revues and was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this set. However, after purchasing all of the other available sets, I think Vol.3 definitely received a "bad rap" as far as quality and content. I have a Magnavox combo dvd/vhs player that cost $89.95. I had absolutely NO problem viewing the double sided discs. There were no skips or freezes. Maybe the problem has been corrected by the manufacturer of the dvd's but I really think that you can buy with confidence. My second "bad rap" is the episode of Mrs. Columbo that is a bonus feature on the set. Any episode with ventriloquist dummies freaks me out (since I watched Twilight Zone and "Dead Of Night". I think that this episode (although probably misplaced on this set) is well worth a watch. All in all, the collection is well worth the purchase and no collection would be complete without it. I can also recommend Vols. 1,2 and 4. I'll let you know abot Vol. 5 in the near future.
