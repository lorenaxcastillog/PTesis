 From the opening performance, I had fond memories as a child of Marvin Gaye being featured on American Bandstand. The difference between then and now is that the sound is coming from a good state of the art stereo system rather than a small TV speaker, and so I did not realize how good these performances sound. They, in fact, sound like a well recorded record with stereo separation and all. Additionally, while viewing this DVD, I concluded that Marvin Gaye sounded better in the beginning of his career than at the end of it. In the beginning, he was clean shaven, polished and formal. Surprisingly, I have grown to appreciate what Berry Gordy was trying to do for these young Motown artists in the beginning of their career. The music here is great and timeless, and a joy to listen to after so many years. Get this one even if you have to hitch hike to the store to get it. :-
