 This is simply the cutest animated feature I have seen in years. The characters are superb. The art is fantastic. The humor will catch young and old alike, and I do mean young AND old. This is one cartoon that will be appreciated by those in their retirement years. Actually, some of the puns will go right over the heads of the younger crowd. The film had me laughing as much as I have laughed at anything for a l o n g time. Then, just when I thought it was over, a short follow up came after the credits. Then, just when I thought THAT was over, I discovered a couple of shorter animated bonus features and began laughing all over again. I could find no faults. I only have two suggestions: 1. Buy a copy for yourself 2. Buy a copy as a gift for that special someone.
