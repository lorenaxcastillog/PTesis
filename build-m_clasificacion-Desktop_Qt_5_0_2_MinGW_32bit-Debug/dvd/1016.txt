 The story is around a woman who decided to work in the mines so she could give her children a decent life. Men didn't want women there. They felt it was jobs being usurped by them. They used sexual harassment as a tool to get them to quit there jobs. I found this difficult to watch since I filed a lawsuit (and won) again the factory I worked at where the men got paid more than the women for doing the same work. Fortunately, I didn't have to endure that kind of harassment (but I was harassed occasionally). I don't think I could have handled it. This kind of treatment even if it's not on the scale she dealt with does happen. Then the fact she had to go to court where the scrutinized her sexual background really made me angry. It's just not right that women had to put up with this injustice. I don't know how much is truth or fiction. It's "inspired by a true story". But it rings of emotional truth and that's what's important. I recommend this movie if you are a contemplative person.
