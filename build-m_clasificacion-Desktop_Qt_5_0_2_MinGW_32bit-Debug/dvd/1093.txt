 Two samurai owe their lives to Fuu, a ditsy waitress who saved their lives. She saved their lives under one condition; help Fuu find the samurai who 'Smells of sunflowers'. Director Shinichiro Watanabe became famous for his anime masterpiece, 'Cowboy Bebop'. Which I very much enjoyed and would heavily recommend. Besides 2 shorts from 'The Animatrix', Champloo would be his next project. This is the most amazing anime series I have ever seen. And I'll be damned if anyone thinks otherwise. From the characters, to the storyline in each episode, everything is perfect. And the Finale is really something to marvel over. It's absolutely amazing. My favorite episodes would have to be 'Memories of the lost verse' part one and two. I have to warn you though, beware of episode 22, and don't let it get the best of you. It's just mind provoking fun. Just a filler. If you love anime, watch this. If you don't, watch this. I guarantee you'll be anime-addicted after one episode
