 An excellent comedy, Ali G Indahouse, brings to the screen the story of a down-on-his-luck young man who is introduced into the world of politics in the form of an elected Member of Parliament in order to be used as bait to bring down the British Prime Minister. What complicates things is that he does a pretty good job... Sacha Baron Cohen and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! In short, Ali G Indahouse is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!
