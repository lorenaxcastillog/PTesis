 This is an awesome concert, and the full range of Cheap Trick's musical styles is showcased in front of their most loyal fans from thier home town. You can tell the band is enjoying themselves, and this makes the concert all the more exciting. My personal favorite is the high energy song &quot;You're All Talk.&quot; Powerful, but lesser known songs from their later period, like &quot;Woke Up With a Monster&quot; and &quot;Never Had a Lot to Lose&quot; also get their time to shine on stage. In fact, the song selection is a history of Cheap Trick; indeed, a special treat is the short return of bassist Jon Brandt to play some of the 80's material. If you like the band's earlier songs, get &quot;Live in Australia&quot; or &quot;Music For Hangovers,&quot; but if you want to get a taste of the full musical range of this amazing band, then this is the DVD for you. Buy this DVD and Surrender to The Dream Police because That 70's Song band is Gonna Raise Hell until I Can't Take It, so Stop This Game and light The Flame, Ain't That a Shame
