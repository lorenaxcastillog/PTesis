 Though I'm still a big South Park fan, I do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons. This season has its standouts, most notably the truly demented Christmas Critters episode, but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes. To make matters worse, Matt and Trey put next to no effort into providing any extras for fans who pony up top dollar for the dvd collections. A show like the Simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the Simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans: full episode commentaries with writers, producers, directors, voice actors, etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features. Matt and Trey provide generally uninteresting "mini commentaries." No doubt about it, the boys are just generally "phoning it in" at this point, seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible
