 I first saw this movie as two part "fund raiser" special on PBS. Having grown up in NY in the early sixties this wonderful movie by Scorsese really brought back a flood of memories I didn't even know I had of that period. While this movie is shot in a documentary form it flows effortlessly through Dylan's formative and (I think) most creative years. The mix of performances and following Dylan and his entourage are masterfully done. The interviews with an older weary Dylan and his contemporaries are so insightful: Dave Van Ronk, Allen Ginsberg, Maria Muldaur and of course the incomparable Joan Baez who still seems to have such a soft spot for Bob and his genius. If you're even remotely interested in Dylan and the music of that era this is a must have DVD for your collection. Kudos go to Scorsese for whom this was clearly a labor of love. The times they have changed...we just don't have music with this power any more
