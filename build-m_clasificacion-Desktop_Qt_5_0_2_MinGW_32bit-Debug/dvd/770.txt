 This film from Denmark is incredible to view. Although a step behind the German film made a year earlier, I believe this movie garnered many of the international film awards due in part to the presence of Max Von Sidow. The boy in this film is incredible. And an astonishing fact: When Pelle Hvennegard was born, his mother named him "Pelle" after the title character of this novel. Hence, eleven years later the boy is in a film from this very same book. There are some tense scenes that follow the novel quite accurately. The shame and humiliation this young boy faces, being lured into a barn where he is later publicly degraded with a bare-skin flogging. The film veers away from the novel a bit when it comes to the boy's leisure activities while tending his animals in the meadow. If you've ever read the book and are aniticipating these scenes in the film, you will be sorrowfully disappointed. I'd still recommend this movie to any "coming-of-age" film viewer, and to anyone who enjoys classic cinema at its best
