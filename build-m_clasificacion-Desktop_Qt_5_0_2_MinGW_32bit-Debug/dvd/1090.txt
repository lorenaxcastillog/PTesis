 this is the first exercise dvd I have ever used and was not sure it would be for me. I can honestly say that I am getting use out of this, I don't dread turning it on because 10 minutes is easy to talk myself into, and usually once I'm on the floor and the dvd is playing I end up doing 20 or 30 minutes. The belly exercises were by far the most challenging for me (at least the first 5 minutes or so), I hadn't exercised my abs at all for a good while and this really has made a big difference, I feel a lot more toned around the middle after using this maybe 2 or 3 times a week. The bun and thigh exercises were challenging as well. One exercise in particular for the butt has you lying on your back, one leg towards the ceiling while the other leg lifts you up and down...by the end of the reps my butt is quivering. This dvd is probably not for anyone who is more advanced but for those of us starting the get into shape its a great way to do it.
