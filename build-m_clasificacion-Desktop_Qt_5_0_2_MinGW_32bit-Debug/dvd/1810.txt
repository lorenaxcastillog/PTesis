 This is my number one most overrated movie of all time. We saw it at a pretensious artsy theater, along with an assortment of ex-hippies and wooly haired intellectuals. They all cheered, of course, when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water, then becomes the chief. The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme. The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture. The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil. The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys. Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you. But it is not good. It is not creative. There are no surprises. There is just nothing there. As I edit this, it's no surprise to find so few people liked this review. There are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so's out there
