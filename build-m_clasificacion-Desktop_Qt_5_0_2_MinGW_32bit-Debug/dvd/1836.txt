 not a great movie... someone made a comment in these reviews about.."Have you ever screwed up unintentionally in a relationship?".. and all i can think is please, the guy in this movie goes out with another girl cause he wants to sleep with her, even tho he doesnt want to admit it to himself, but he does admit it to his friend... he knew what he was doing when he went out with that other girl, it wasnt unintentional, he was a jerk, and he deserved what she put him thru, i found the main actress very funny, and i dont understand why she wanted this jerk back, wont she keep wondering if hes straying? its kinda sad, if a guy with a g/f that pretty strays, what hope is there? i suppose not all guys are jerks... this movie was a rollercoaster, shes showing his whos boss, and he shows her they make eachother jealous, blah blah blah..
