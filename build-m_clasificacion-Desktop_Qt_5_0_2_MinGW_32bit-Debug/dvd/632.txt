 I now have all 3 volumes of this particular set, and like the other ones, it has its' ups and downs. Ups?? Definitely "My New Philosophy" by Kristin Chenowith from the revival of "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"; Jonathan Pryce doing "The American Dream" from "Miss Saigon"; the late (and most definitely great) Jerry Orbach doing "She Likes Basketball" from "Promises, Promises" (so that is what he looked like in 1968), Zero Mostel doing "Comedy Tonight" from "Forum". The downs?? Desi Arnaz's song was much too short, Roert Goulet singing "The Happy Time" (is that the best they could find for him?) But the best part is that for the younger Broadway fans is that this volume, like the others, lets them see the greats of Broadway at their best. And it reminds the rest of us just how much fun it was to watch the Tony Awards then
