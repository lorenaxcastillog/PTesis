 I give this 4 1/2 stars. I rented this from my local On-Line DVD rental company, the one that lets you trade back your on-line rental for a free in-store rental, you know, the one that doesn't start with "Net." What a treat! My wife requested this one as we walked through the New Release aisles. I really love Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and was glad to see them reunited once again, as lovers. The story was a tiny bit confusing, but that is okay, and I thought the cinematography was stunning. I watched this on a very good computer monitor, up close, and thought the picturesque scenes were still wonderful (I normally watch it on my 55 inch HD screen.) I wish they had better character development of some of the side characters, but I think this was the director's intention. I enjoyed seeing that one dude from Nip Tuck. I'd like to see him in more big movies. I give this a rousing 5 stars, but round up form 4.5. MC White said: Very good
