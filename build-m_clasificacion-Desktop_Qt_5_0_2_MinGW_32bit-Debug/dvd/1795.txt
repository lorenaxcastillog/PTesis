 Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original. Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the "Beauty and the Beast" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie "Jurrassic Kong," but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film. Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the "Log Raft" sequence. This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini-statue is a cool bonus - GET IT NOW
