 There is just somthing about this movie that grabs my soul. I've seen it about 15 times now (really) and each time I'm glued as if I've never seen it before. The music is fantastic. Some songs are written and performed by the son of the author of the book from which the movie is based. The sceenery is as much a character as the actors themselves. Especially the house. It's a movie about relationships. Lonley misguided people who find each other and by the hand of Lorraine (who we never meet) are forced to coexist. As time evolves they become a family. You will care about all of the characters in this movie. The atmosphere is very authenitc New Orleans. The seedier side, not the French Quarter touristy side. It's very real. And as I said before the music is excellent. In my opinion, it's one of the best. Especially Mr. Capps music. You will like this move.
