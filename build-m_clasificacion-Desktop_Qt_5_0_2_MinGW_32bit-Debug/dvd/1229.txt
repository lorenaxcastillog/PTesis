 House is the best show on television. There's never been a medical show like this - ever, and I've seen just about all of them. And to have someone of Hugh Laurie's caliber and immense talent is such a great treat for viewers. There is nothing this man can't do. Brilliant and genius are overused words, but in his case, they more than apply. His background in so many British comedies prepared him well for the role of House, but what's so amazing is how he can go from making you laugh one minute, to playing pain and drama like nobody's business. The DVD's are so clear and sharp, and those mesmerizing blue eyes of his are just mind boggling! When the light hits them a certain way, you cannot look at anything or anyone else in the scene. Hugh, if you're reading this I know you hate hearing it, but you are brilliant and sexy as hell!!!! The best show on television, bar none
