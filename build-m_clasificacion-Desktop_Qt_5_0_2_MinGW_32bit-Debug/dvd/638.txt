 I love cardio kickboxing, so of course I had to try my favorite workout guru, Jillian Michaels', new cardio kickbox DVD! I went through it once and was sweating, so I decided that 30 minutes just wasn't enough for me and went through it again! I had to get a towel, I was that sweaty! A great, easy to follow cardio workout that can easily be done without any extra workout tools...no weights, steps, resistance bands required...just your body and your energy! Jillian suggests doing this workout once per week in the middle of the week to break up resistance training, however I think it's a great before-work...don't have time to go to the gym workout to get motivated for the day. I agree with some of the other reviewers...the music could be much better and the workout could be much longer! The downloadable exercise logs are a great bonus. However, the 3 recipes are a little lacking
