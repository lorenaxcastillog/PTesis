 That is what Hotel Rwanda is all about, BUT more importantly it ends with hope, hope that this will never happen again. Don Cheadle gives a performance of a lifetime in this movie. I say that a really good movie can make you tear up, and I was tearing up during this movie. Terry George has directed a fabulous film. Everything is woven together wonderfully. This movie never turns to melodrama and has a documentary type feel to it. Like United 93(another great movie)it draws you in and you know what is going to happen, but when it does you still find yourself in tears. That is what great movies do. The sadness for me is that this is not a fake, it is not fiction. This really happened. The movie is amazing, BUT it also gives you a sense of anger at the US and all the big powers, I love the line Nick Nolte uses after he finds out they are only evacuating the whites. Watch this film, it will give you a much better understanding of what happened in 1994...
