 I believe this is the second release of the DVD of Caddyshack. The 20th Anniversary Release. I don't understand why it wasn't mastered better. The picture is still grainy and unpleasant to the eye. And it's still in mono too. What's the point of a re-issue if there is no improvements? But, nevertheless, it's still a great comedy about America's greatest play field of the snobs and the slobs. It's all a farce on so many levels. Even the fact that most of the players here are much younger than most golfers that I ever see. I work near a gated convelescent golfing community (some younger people live there too. I don't know why.) And being near there you have every right to fear for your safety whenever a golf cart is coming your way, on and off the green. But, you gotta have younger actors on the golf course if your gonna try to sell this movie to people under 71. However, I do enjoy this movie. But, the picture quality of this film is not recommended for bigger screen TV's. That is one major drawback of today's newer, bigger televisions. A crappy picture is even more obvious.
