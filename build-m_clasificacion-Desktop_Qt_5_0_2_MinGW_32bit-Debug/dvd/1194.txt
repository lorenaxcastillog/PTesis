 I found this presentation of King's speech to be excellently portrayed. After a brief introduction, about 5 minutes about the civil right's movement and circumstances leading up to the famous march on Washington, the speech is presented in its entirety. Some of the footage leading up to the speech is emotionally graphic - high pressure fire houses being used on peaceful demonstrators and footage from the aftermath of the Church bombing. I replaced an old VHS copy of, "I Have a Dream" to watch during the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday and enjoy the speech in its entirety whereas other versions merely show clips or portions of it. The only reason I have not given this DVD five stars is because of the brevity of materials. The inclusion of other memorable civil rights speeches, including President Kennedy and/or other speakers at the march would have made this DVD even better. Definately still a good purchase
