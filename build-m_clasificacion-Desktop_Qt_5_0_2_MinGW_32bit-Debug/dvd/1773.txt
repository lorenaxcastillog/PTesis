 I Am Sam is a movie I now treasure and treat very dearly. Not only are the actors absolutely AMAZING, the script captured their desired personalities to create a real and beautiful cast of characters. Not only was the cast well chosen, the technical aspects of this movie serve for a very different feel than what was common when this movie was released. The unsteadiness of the camera and the odd angles create a sense of unbalance and uncertainty when needed, and the colors are bright, vivid, and contribute greately to the scene they're in. I quickly became deeply emersed in this film. This movie made me smile like I haven't in a long time, and I just felt like crying out of happiness. Overall, it's a wonderful movie. I suggest you see this movie, it has the amazing ability to warm a heart like no other film. It's one of a kind, a gem of Hollywood. It is imagination at its best
