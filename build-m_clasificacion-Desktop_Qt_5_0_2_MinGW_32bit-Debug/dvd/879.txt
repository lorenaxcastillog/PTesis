 I remembered loving this movie, and coundn't remember why. Tonight, I looked online at Amazon to read what folks had said about it, and found a fascinating difference in the reviews. One the first "page" are 7 reviews. Here are the Titles of the positive reviews (4.9 ave rating): Awe inspiring Good bye -- illusions EXCELLENT MOVIE/Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!, Out of the box A Must See This movie is about control one of the most important movies ever made These words from a negative review: "nature versus civilization is always a rich topic--it's that Instinct boils them down to inane sound bites." Bottom line: You might love this movie or dislike this movie, but there is something interesting to discover in either case. Those who believe in the premise love it, and those who don't believe in the premise do not. I've never seen any movie that can better serve as a basis for significant spiritual conversation as this movie can.
