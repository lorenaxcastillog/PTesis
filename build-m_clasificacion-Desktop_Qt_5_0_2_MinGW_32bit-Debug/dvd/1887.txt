 A stormingly brilliant film that blends the best of Billy Elliot with Amelie whilst coming close to the fringes of an Autism flick. The main character, LV, is agoraphobic, socially phobic, more or less echolalic in her capacity to mimic brilliantly any singer and somewhat selectively mute. She also comes very close to someone with high functioning autism or Asperger's without ever labouring the point of disability or labels in any way. That's whats so marvellous about this film, its story, its writing, its direction, its acting... seriously, can't praise this one highly enough. Michael Caine is fabulous, gritty and brilliantly annoying. Brenda Blethyn is fantastic as his appaling side-kick beastly mother to LV. Jane Horrocks as LV is an incredible talent and her performance of LV stands up to the standard of Hoffman in Rain Man without a problem. She is astounding here. And its an entertaining, informative, captivating and ultimately highly enjoyable film
