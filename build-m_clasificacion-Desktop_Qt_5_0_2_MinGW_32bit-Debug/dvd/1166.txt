 We own four DVDs in this series: Math Circus, Code Word Caper, The Letter Factory, and the Talking Words Factory. We bought them when our boys were ages five and three. We've had them for about a year now, and the boys still enjoy them. We get a lot more use out of them than the Leap Pads, which our kids never really got into. Our younger boy is in speech therapy, and seeing these DVDs has improved his articulation of letters. I love that he requests to watch these. I will hear him sounding out each letter along with the Frog, and know he's developing skills. Our older son has picked up on how to build words and spell with this series. It explains how phonics work, and in a simple-to-understand way. We found all of the DVDs in this series exceptionally educational, and see tangible results from the children watching them. I can't say that about any other toy we own
