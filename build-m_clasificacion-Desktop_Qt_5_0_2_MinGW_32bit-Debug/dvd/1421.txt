 If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Dracula, this is not it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It's a fun, popcorn movie that will not make you think. At all. Seriously. Not a thought in your head, unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of Scotland since kilts, Gerard Butler. Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full "Atilla" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable. So if you like wire fight scenes, new intrepretations of old myths, Mardi Gras beads and pretty Scots, this is the movie for you. If you want to think, there are plenty of documentary DVDs available on this site! Cheers
