 Ok first off I love the show all of it every second im watching this show im in heaven.My favorite part u gussed it the action,fighting, all the things Bebop was famous for OH and the edgey edge of the show mixed with rap/hip-hop style is great.Now for the review of the final disc,#7 it is great the way the story progresses and the climax are done perfectly as well as the return to the back story you get all your ansers you want.Alas the only thing in the entire series i have issuses with is the last 2:00 min before the credits in the very very end of the last episode is that when they to a 3 road cross way they go diffrent directions and the credists role that bgurned me up i liked them being togeather though the whole series and now they split? But i still have to give it a 5 beacuse i love it so much. Must cheak it out now go buy 1-7 and watch them with delight
