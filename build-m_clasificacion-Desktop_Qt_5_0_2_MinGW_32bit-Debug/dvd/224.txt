 "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a classic comedy, driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by Michael Caine and Steve Martin. The storyline has been addressed extensively by other reviewers, but I will add that this film definitely breaks Mom's old rule: "don't make fun of the handicapped." Not only are Martin and Caine's characters both morally handicapped in the extreme, but Martin gets to play not one but two handicapped characters as he works his cons: one is in a wheelchair, and the other (Ruprecht)....well, I don't know exactly what Ruprecht's handicap is, but I can understand why he's kept locked up in his room. Finally, this movie has a lovely look to it, allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the French Riviera, stay in the finest hotels and villas, and sip the best champagne - that's a step up from most movies these days right there. No explosions or violence. Amazing.
