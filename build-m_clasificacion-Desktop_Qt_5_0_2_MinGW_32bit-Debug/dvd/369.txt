 A stroll down memory lane, with one of the most interesting wrestlers. By far, it was worth 5 stars. If I had any complaint, it would be be overuse of the "younger Jake" double drinking at the bar and popping pills. A few times got the point across. They could have used that time to throw in a couple more Snake Pit segments as extras. No one is ever happy with all the matches presented, of course, or all the footage. The only two bits I would have liked to see was that blindfolded versus blindfolded Rick Martel and Jake Roberts match, and also footage from the one Saturday Night's Main Event, when Honky Tonk Man dressed as Kimchi and attacked Jake, but then later, at the end, when Jake got his revenge with Damion. Still, excellent fun! My only other question now is, where the hell is a ROWDY RODDY PIPER DVD?
