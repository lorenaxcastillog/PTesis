 I just wanted to say that I grew up watching the Back to the Future trilogy and will be the first to say that these movies are absolutely brilliant. If you don't own these movies, own them. They should grace every homes movie collection. They are good on so many levels. The great thing is, the older I get, and the more I watch them, the more I catch that is interesting or funny...it just keeps getting better. These movies are so quotable, my whole family is always dropping lines from these movies and friends as well. The cast is so perfect, Micheal J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Flea, and whoever plays Biff, every one of them. Spielberg is to be commended on blessing this world with something so truly enjoyable. These movies can be watched over and over again and they just get better. If you haven't seen them, get on it, you wont be disappointed
