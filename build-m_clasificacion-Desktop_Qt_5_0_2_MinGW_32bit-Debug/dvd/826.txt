 I'm giving this 5 stars, although it should be said this is the first workout video I've tried so I don't really have anything to compare it to. But I bought it because I had tried pilates briefly awhile ago and enjoyed it, and I wanted to strenghten my whole body. I have 3 kids and only a spare 20 minutes or so out of a whole day; I've been using this dvd at night when they'e asleep. I really really like it. The moves aren't easy, but they are doable and I can feel it working. The next day, even after the first time I did it, I feel like I'm standing straighter. It's also very relaxing...as I said I do it at night and while it pumps me up and energizes me while I'm doing it, when I'm done my mind feels clearer and my body feels good and it puts me at ease. I really like it!!
