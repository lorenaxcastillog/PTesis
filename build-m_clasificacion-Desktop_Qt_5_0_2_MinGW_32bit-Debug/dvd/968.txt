 Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability. We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end. If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead. What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining. Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot. So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away. But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire. As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick. Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist.
