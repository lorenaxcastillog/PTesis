 When this first came out, I watched it so often. It's still a good movie although obviously outdated in more ways than one. Terry Griffith wants to be taken seriously as a reporter, but feels that she is held back because she is a girl. What does she do? She transfers schools and dresses like a guy to write the ultimate story. Of course, she already had a boyfriend, but he's a bit of a jerk and she finds herself falling for her best male friend who doesn't know her secret. There are no surprises in this movie - it's very predictable, but it's still funny and fun to watch. Her brother Buddy is hilarious and he has the quote of the whole movie. When Terry asks him if he is OK, he sadly replies, "No I'm not ok. Mom and Dad come home Monday. I've had two weeks of total freedom. The closest I've come to sex was a girl who took her top off to seduce my sister". It's a classic movie that will make you laugh and is thoroughly enjoyable
