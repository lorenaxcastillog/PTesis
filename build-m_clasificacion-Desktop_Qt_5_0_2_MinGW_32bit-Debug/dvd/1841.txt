 James Gunn delivers a rehashed version of every horror film genre into one and it's a hit. "Slither" never aspires to being anything other than an over-the-top gore fest wit a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. After a meteor crashes (right behind an unaware police cruiser), red, slimy slugs start crawling around seeking human mouths. Of course, they gestate and the poor victims turn into George Romero type zombies that spit deadly poison. The first to get infected is the richest and horniest guy in town, but his wife has a headache. He infects others by impaling them with two slimy hose-like spikes (you have to have two to get infected, ya know). Its sex and gore zombie-ism combined. Pretty soon the whole town is sex starved and infecting each other. The good guy sheriff comes to the rescue with the rich guys wife after many a tight squeeze and lots of thrilling near misses. With more than enough clever lines and gruesome site gags, these folks bring on a fantastically guts filled splatter-filled ending that's creepy and disgustingly sexy all at once. This one is a true original made from some good old scraps
