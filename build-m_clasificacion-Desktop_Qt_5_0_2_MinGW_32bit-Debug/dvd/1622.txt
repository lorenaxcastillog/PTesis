 Okay, I saw the movie on TV. Sadly, It failed (as I said in my AOD review) but that's because all the good stuff was cut out. Then I rented it the movie, and I loved the original uncut version. Truly amazing! A great sequel. STORY: Ash returns to the remote cabin with his girlfriend. The stay at the cabin turns into a nightmare. The next morning, He gets attacked by the unseen evil, and because of that, he unleashes Evil Ash. He tries to escape, but the bridge has been destroyed! Now, his hand goes all bad, which turns him into a one-handed zombie killer, and when people find him in the cabin, they dislike him at first. But when they learn what has happened to them, they must tam up with Ash. OPINION: Awesome sequel! More gore, more excitement, and I love the ending. Waves the atmosphere ready for Army Of Darkness. So go rent this sequel
