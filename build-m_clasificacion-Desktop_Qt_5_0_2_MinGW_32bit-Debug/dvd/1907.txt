 I am an adult ballet student. I've been dancing for 4 years and wanted to be able to workout at home when I couldn't make a class. This video is not a ballet class workout - there is no bar, center, across the floor setup. There is no music for you to feel as you watch the few exercises they guide you through. It is more of an aerobics class workout. The dancers are wearing dance sneakers! I'm very disappointed and glad it cost me less than $10 to buy this - I'd return it if I could! The voice on the tape is horrifically monetone and the dancers are not moving to any type of music - there's the same background music playing the whole time so you can't even feel a pattern. Do not waste your time on this if you are looking to mimic a ballet class workout.
