 When i first saw this movie about 5 years ago i was in a stunned awe. No way could i have waited so long to see this masterpiece. I was instantly a Chow fan and a John Woo fan. The gunfights were unbelievable-my jaw was on the floor! From the tea house to the climactic hospital bulletfest i was totally absorbed in it. Even 13 years after its release i still cant find one that measures up to it (except for maybe Woo's other great flicks The Killer and A Better Tomorrow 2) anyone who is a huge action fan like me MUST add this to their collection. this movie confirmed to the world that Chow Yun-Fat IS the world's coolest actor. The cast is perfect from Tony Leung as the seemingly lost undercover cop/triad to Phillip Kwok as the coolest badguy youll find in movies. Take my word for it-youll love it
