 by 1992 and aladdin's release disney was riding high with such hits as "the little mermaid" and "beauty and the beast." disney carried on it's trend with this fun filled adventure.aladdin was truely a great additiion to the disney cannon because of strenght and subtleties. the story is well delivered and blends action, and romance briliantly along with comic relief characters that never seem corny or out of place. that seemlessnes keeps this film from becoming too sereous or light hearted. the animation is strong yet again. by this point disney was beginning to experiment with computer animation and what it could do. that helped the film imensley. the film's animation style itself is highly stylized but it works perfectly here. the music ties it all together and is just as strong as in preveous disney films. all these increadable elements come together to form a solid entertaining film. it isn't disney greatest of their modern four hits, but it holds up nicely and is quite impressive. it is definately, definately worth owning.
