 I am a resident of Central New York and this story was very well known to everybody in these parts.If your reading this you probally have read some of the other reviews so I`ll be brief.This is an incredible film,you are taken to a place that exists and people that are exactly what you see...its almost like travelling back to the turn of the century when you visit the Ward farm.The Ward brothers were indeed considered outsiders by some locals but they,ultimately,were a genuine thread that made up the fabric of this community and after Delbert is charged with his brothers murder and when the people sensed a railroading by a politically minded D.A.,they rally to Delbert`s defense.It is a unique look at small town America...from its citizens,its lifestyle and its politics. The film is sometimes funny,disturbing and even uncomfortable at times but it is as powerful an experience as you could ever have.Like another documentary I have seen - Sunshine Hotel....about flophouses on the Bowery in New York City - it pulls no punches and hits hard....gritty and bold it will resonate long after its final credits have rolled
