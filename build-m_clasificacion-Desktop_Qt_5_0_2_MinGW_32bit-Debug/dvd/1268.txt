 Bill Nighy is all painful tentativeness in this HBO film about a shy man who is part of a British delegation to a G8 conference in Iceland. Impulsively inviting along a soft-spoken young woman he meets in a cafe, he inadvertently draws her concerned attention to the plight of the world's poor and starving, one of several items on the meeting's agenda. While the others at the conference (as well as some reviewers of this film) are able to dismiss the urgency of this issue for reasons of national interest (economy, security), she becomes an embarrassment to the British team by speaking up and attempting to appeal to conscience and a sense of moral outrage. It's both a gentle love story and a moral fable, as well as a call-to-action for film audiences to stop ignoring world poverty - the cause of preventable death every three seconds. The film is beautifully performed and photographed in a chilly Iceland location. The DVD includes an informative commentary by the writer and director
