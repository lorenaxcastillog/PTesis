 When most of us think of homeless people, we think of someone who is a completely undesirable outcast. This film shows us that this isn't the case. While the people in this film have obviously made some very poor choices in their lives, they are still people. They are just trying to make the best of the situation that they're now in. I've gained a new respect for the homeless in watching this, and a new appreciation for all of the many blessings in this life. Dark Days is a very moving picture of what goes on in the forgotten places in our society. The people in this film have hit bottom. They now just desparately want to be able to move beyond their mistakes, and make a better start in life. Not only has the director captured a commonality not normally associated between ourselves and the homeless, but in the end, he actually gives them that new start! The film can be depressing at times, but in the end, it is very heartwarming! Don't miss it!
