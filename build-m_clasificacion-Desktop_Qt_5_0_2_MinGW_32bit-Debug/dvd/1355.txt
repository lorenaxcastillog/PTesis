 Section A) Do NOT buy this DVD if: 1) You are demanding 5 - 20 big-budget MTV videos. Section B) DO buy this DVD if: 1) You enjoy a mix of professional and amatuer films of live performance footage and totally off-the-wall scenes with Buckethead+friends in someone's apartment. 2) You are an electric guitar player that wants lots of visual content focused on one of the most unique guitarists while he is playing. 3) You enjoy a thorough archive of one artist's career -when he was young and not signed to a record label, footage of cultishly famous performances. 4) You buy a lot of Buckethead CD's anyway. If this is the case, then you will be overjoyed at the amount of music you will get for less than $20. I am a Buckethead fan, and this DVD is getting plenty of playtime on my computer. One CON: The navigation is intentionally a quirky puzzle, so be prepared to work your way through the thing. One PRO: Thank you whoever made this, I feel I got a lot more than $15 worth of DVD
