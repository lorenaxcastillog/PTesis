 I enjoyed the History Channel's subject on the origins of the aircraft carriers up to the present day. It was an eye opener also that some of the innovations of the modern US aircraft carriers were designed by the British. However, I noticed that the jeep carriers of World War 2 were not included and that although the Forrestal class was discussed at lenght, the Kitty Hawk and JFK class of aircraft carriers were not part of subject. The Enterprise is a class of its own and the Nimitz class ships were very detailed. I would have preferred though that the latest and most modern and recently commissioned Ronald Reagan included in the film. The LHAs and LHDs were also not brought out when one can see that they resemble the carriers, they still are by and large aircraft carriers. Otherwise, the documentary was very good and I look forward to other films about modern ships not only of the US but also with the former Soviet Union
