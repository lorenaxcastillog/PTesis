 I had never heard of this film until I rented it, then purchased it after watching. Originally it was to be a 40 minute film tied together with 2 others to make one giant film about the relationship between humans and aliens. The story was then expanded upon to make it a feature all by itself. The story taken from an excellent short story from Philip K Dick, involves a not to distant future earth at war with an alien race we never really see. Earth cities are protected by domes as the aliens seek a way to get to us. This leads to a paranoid society trying to do anything to protect itself. Sinise is excellent in his role as he takes us on one adventure after another as he tries to prove to the authorities that he is not an alien plant. The twist ending was also a plus for the movie. The pciture is not perfect, and the extras suck, but this one is a good watch
