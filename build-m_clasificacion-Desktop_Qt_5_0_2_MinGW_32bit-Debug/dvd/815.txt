 Having not read the book, I found this film completely captivating and warmed my heart to consider a view point of heaven different than I had imagined. I think it's unfair to compare the book version to the film version because selling a copy of the other is boring. It's the differences in interpretation of the story that carry it from one generation to the next. If it were an exact copy, you'd have been dissappointed that you knew what was around every corner. The characters are so well developed and you'll quickly fall in love with them as they are everyday people that could just as easily be in your life and not the film. This film is a masterpiece in displaying one idea of what our life's meaning could be. I think it displays a believable pathway to better understand the web of relationships that are brought into our life for a higher purpose
