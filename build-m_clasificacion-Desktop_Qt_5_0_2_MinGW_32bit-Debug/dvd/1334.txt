 As Lisa Kay says, "We have 30 minutes to shape your legs!" This video definitely accomplishes that. Lisa is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who demonstrates beginner modifications. You will need a Fanny Lifter, or stool/step and assorted dumbells. The majority of the workout is strength work, there are 3 sets of leg presses, some of which incorporate some calf raises, squats, lunges, dips, plie squats, curtsy dips, plus some cardio segments to give the legs a brief break from the weight work while keeping the heartrate up. This video was quite challenging for me, Lisa does a good job instructing here. For those looking for short lower body workouts, this is a good choice. You will work the legs from every angle and then some. It should be noted that it is all standing leg work, there is no floor work here. There is another Firm video available called Lower Body Sculpt II which is all floor work. Overall a good lower body strengthening routine
