 Match Point is one of a kind. Shot in and around London, this movie questions one's own take on loyalty in a relationship - plus what one considers as wrong and right. I doubt if the storyline is at all relatable. Scarlett Johansson shines in her role as Nola Rice,and her lips are more beautiful than ever. What is this film about? I can't be bothered to tell you because you'll get bored. You have to see it to appreciate it. Until the last scene was over, a likable kind of a suspense/curiosity surrounds the storyline. The film has no background music except this awkward European language song that keeps playing every now and then. I loved the scene where the actor cries while traveling in a taxi. The Good - Scarlett Johansson, Direction, Easy to like dark humor, the logic and masterfully induced irony, the characters are very very well dressed and you like looking at people who're looking good The Bad - Can't watch it again Overall - 8.4/10 P.S - I've never been a Scarlett Johansson fan before MATCH POINT
