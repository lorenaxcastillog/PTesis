 Once again, Universal gives a good Tv show, a terrible release on DVD. As with their other TV shows and now some of their movies, the picture and sound have improved but there are no bonus features. In some cases, the shows were cut and paste edited, some of the music was changed, and the DVD's still freeze frame in the middle of the show and the DVD player unfreezes the frame by going back to the show's opening titles. What Gives?! I have seen bare bones releases and second rate DVD's releases from other companies (most notely with Disney and Warners), but Universal also is rapidly joining the list of companies that corner the market with bad and defective DVD standards. All I can do is stop watching Tv shows or movies made by Universal, because now it is more then likely that they will give them bad DVD releases that are not worth my time or money
