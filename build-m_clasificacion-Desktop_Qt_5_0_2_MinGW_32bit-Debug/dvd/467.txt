 A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all. I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great. It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously. Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.) My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required. Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door
