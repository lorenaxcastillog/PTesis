 The film starts out so well, and after a while a serious suspension of disbelief was required. Still, I'm a fan of the new assortment of animated features that have been put across our tables, and "Monster House" is a treat. I won't go into my issues regarding plot holes, because that would give away too much, and I won't do that. I will say that the assembled cast was without fault; I especially thought Jason Lee captured the essence of the stoner very well. Children have quite resilient imaginations, regarding spooky stuff, and the many plot twists will hold their attention. The bottom line is that this film should be taken for exactly what it is: a fun adventure seen through the eyes of some interesting kids. Indeed, all the characters were well-developed. The widescreen DVD is the ONLY way to see this, and the DVD extras are plentiful and genuinely informative. Enjoy!
