 As part of the NBC Mystery Night Movie line up with "Columbo" and "McCloud," enter one of prime-time television's most loved on-screen couples. The chemistry between the two leads, Rock Hudson and Susan St. James undoubtedly paid handsome dividends to this series featuring the crimefighting exploits of San Francisco Police Commissioner Stewart McMillan and his trendy wife, Sally. Nancy Walker as the McMillan's wisecracking maid and John Schuck as Stewart's not-so-bright assistant, play comedic foil to the couples amusing-but-cute domestic squabbles and sleuthing. It's enjoyable to watch both Hudson and St. James compliment each other so well in each episode, and this, in part, accounts for the success of the series as a whole. And, as a native of the San Francisco Bay Area, I haven't had so much fun identifying recognizable circa 1970's SF locations since the last time I watched "Streets of San Francisco" in syndication! When will that be released in DVD? So Universal, where is our Season 2 of McMillan & Wife?
