 I miss this show so much, Once and Again was such a great show with a well-talented cast. Sela Ward, Billy Campbell, Evan Rachel Wood, Shane West and the rest of the cast played these characters with authenticity and strength. Wood went on to star in the incredible film, Thirteen, I just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season. In the second season of Once and Again, her charater Jessie struggles with anorexia, her scenes are so touching and raw, what a gifted young actress, she was the main reason I tuned in every week, just remarkable. Sela Ward is good in everything she is in. My fave episode is the Thanksgiving episode. Patrick Dempsey guest starred as Ward's mentally challenged brother from time to time. I hope the third season gets released but I doubt it. All the finest shows on t.v. get the ax way too soon, it's a shame. Buy this, you won't regret it
