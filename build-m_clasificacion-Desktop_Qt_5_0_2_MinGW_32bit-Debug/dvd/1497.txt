 Now I'm usually one what finds anything old Bob and David have to offer as funnier than a clown holdin' a bag of farts, but "Run Ronnie Run" is not on par with previous Mr. show offerings. For those of you who are fans of Mr. Show and the original Ronnie skit, you aren't gonna find much new here. Pretty much a rehashing of that same skit, which plays (the skit) hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on, but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of Bob and David's talents. Granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show, but the laughs get spread pretty thin. I subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segway at certain points to another skit, as Mr. Show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons. The movie's worth a view for you die-hard Mr. Show fans, but can't say I'd add it to my collection. Keep 'em coming Gleep-Glop
