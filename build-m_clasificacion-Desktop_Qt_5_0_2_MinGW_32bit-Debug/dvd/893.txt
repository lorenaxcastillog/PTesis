 Crude language, Wild philosophy taken to an extreme. The attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated R. Even though it may seem like all fun and games, and you may not want to say otherwise, you know it's more than that. Looking at the title, it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film. Right about the comedic part, but so wrong on everything else. There are hearts broken in ways you wouldn't have imagined, two Huckabee models and "everything else Huckabees." Jason Schartzman plays the main character, and I found out that he's the drummer in Phantom Planet, a great pop band! (I hear he's arrogant though, and this fact only would enhance it.) Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law are in it. Mark Wahlberg is truly convincing in this one. If you like South Park, Daria, or any kind of toilet humor, this movie may just be for you
