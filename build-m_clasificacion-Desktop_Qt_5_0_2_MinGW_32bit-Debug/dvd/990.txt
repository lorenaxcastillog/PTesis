 Yeah, I know my title may not be grammatically correct but I don't really care. Both movies stand by themselves in their own right. And to get both for such a cheap price?! I was quite happy to buy. Yes, the movies are split over two discs: get over it. It takes only a brief minute to change the disc. If you really do need that extra minute in your life, trim off the time you take to get that starbucks double mocha cappucino. Cause lord knows, if you're complaining about walking 5 feet, turning over a disc, and walking back, you need to stop drinking the fatty drinks. Aside from that, both films look better than they ever have. There are plenty of extras for those who need them. Sure, it doesn't contain Hearts of Darkness. But, that's really a separate entity which I'm sure they will release soon, completely remastered on DVD. For the newbies, this is the edition to get, hands down. It's inexpensive and the best transfer for both pictures.
