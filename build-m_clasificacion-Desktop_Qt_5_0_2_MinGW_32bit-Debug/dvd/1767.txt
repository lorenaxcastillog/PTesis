 I think the only strong points of "The Phantom Menace" is Darth Maul and the lightsaber duals, which I thought were well done, and the visual effects and scenery. But other than that, "The Phantom Menace" was just an unfortunate mistake. I think the problem is that Lucas broke one of the unofficial science fiction filmmaking rules: You've-got-to-keep-children-out-of-science fiction-stories. Or at least show them as little as possible. How can we take a space dogfight scene seriously when you have a little kid who doesn't know how to pilot a fighter, buzzing all around the battle and saying things like "this is intense?" I never understood why they felt they had to go that far back into Anakin's life anyway. Why not just begin the story with Anakin in his twenties and already under the tutelage of Obi-wan? That's when all the important events began. And Jar Jar, well, we know the consensus on him. Well, at least things got more serious again in "Attack of the Clones," and would continue to improve with "Revenge of the Sith.
