 Has some great shots of the mountain, you "kind of" get a feel for how it would be to climb it. You don't really get too attached the characters, but who cares about them, you're watching it for the mountain. A couple things: the movie doesn't make the climb look all that dangerous, and lacks any drama that you might expect to see in a movie about climbing everest (even the part where they talk about the '96 disaster is intentionally played down). The makers of the film seemed to want to give the movie a "G" rated Disney feeling and do so successfully. I'd recommend it, but due to how short it is relative to others, and the lack of showing the true hardships of the mountain, I'd recommend other Everest videos before this one. My favorite Everest film so far is NGC's "50 Years on the Mountain" NOT to be confused with Surviving Everest, which is completely awful and a sad waste of money. Happy Arm Chair Climbing
