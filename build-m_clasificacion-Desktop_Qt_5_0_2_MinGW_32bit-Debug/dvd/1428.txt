 The movie "Sleepy Hollow" is aptly named. While its characters are based on the those depicted in Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," and the tale takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, the story varies greatly from the novel. Tim Burton's approach gives a new twist to the tale, and the performances by the leading actors are remarkable. The added features provide insight to the making of the film. However, it is not for the faint of heart. While the beheadings aren't over bloody due to the "power" of the horseman's sword, they are explicit and may not be suitable for young viewers. Also, for anyone who is a stickler on details, while the panoramic views of the Hudson River at the beginning and end of the film are breathtaking, Sleepy Hollow is on the OTHER side of the river. Overall I greatly enjoyed the movie and recommend the film to those who enjoy horror with a twist of "gallows humor," Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films
