 Runaway Bride will forever be a classic. It is one of those movies you have to buy on DVD because you can watch it over and over. It`s a perfect movie to watch for whatever mood you're in. Having been to the town of Berlin, Maryland, also known as Hale in the movie, it brings out the small town feel. The movie perfectly captures this and makes you feel like another town's person. All the little shops such as the hair cutter, "Curl Up and Die", are so adorable and make you wish that you too were from a small town. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are also great for the movie. The big businessman chasing the small town girl is such an entertaining story line. Although they are so different, they are perfect for each other. Another thing I really enjoyed about the movie was seeing Julia's old wedding videos and then having Richard visit the men. Overall, it is such at charming movie. I would recommend it to all ages and it is defiantly worth seeing.
