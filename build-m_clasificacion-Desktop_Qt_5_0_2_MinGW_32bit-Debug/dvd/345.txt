 When I first heard they were going to turn the Da Vinci Code into a motion picture I was disappointed. It would made a much better mini-series, and I still believe that; however, hats off to Ron Howard (director) and Akiva Goldsman (writer) for making a film that captures the true essence of the novel. What they chose to leave out works and the main storyline remains untouched from the novel. I also wasn't thrilled when I heard Tom Hanks had been cast in the lead role of Robert Langdon, and while his performance was good I still think he was too old for the role. A man in his middle to late thirties would have been a better choice than the aging, pudgy Hanks. Regardless of this small gripe The Da Vinci Code, as a movie, was very good. Even though I've read the novel upon which it is based twice, I still found myself on the edge of my seat as I watched the film. if you liked the novel, you will like the movie
