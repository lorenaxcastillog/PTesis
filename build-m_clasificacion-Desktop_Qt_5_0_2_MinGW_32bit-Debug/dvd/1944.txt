 I think most of the people here who wrote reviews must be very young. Those of us who saw all of the original "walking tall" trilogy (and own the DVD set) know that the rock's version is really bad compared to that. With respect to their opinions - if you watched the original trilogy you might realize what Buford Pusser actually went through. His story should have been preserved. I think they changed his name because it was so far gone from the original plot that it wouldn't be fair to use his name. I understand what they tried to do in this movie, but I just didn't care for it personally. I also think this movie was way too short. I may have been able to live with the changes from the original "walking tall" movies, but just when this movie starts to get good it ends. It's the shortest movie I've ever seen. I was very disappointed. I sold the movie the day after I bought it because I knew I would never watch it again
