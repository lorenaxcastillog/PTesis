 If you are someone like myself who thinks that the greatest cartoons are from the 30's and 40's, then this dvd is for you. If you love cartoons from this era, then you'll understand what makes this dvd so special---the great animation, jazzy background music, vintage sound effects, voice characterizations, rich black and white, or color. It's all here. The thing that's great about these old cartoons is the fact that there is movement--constantly. I can't even believe some people my age (i'm 32) condemn these cartoons as being 'old' and would prefer the limited animation techniques of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons we grew up with on Saturday morning television. The Flip the Frog cartoons are the biggest surprise and are reminiscent of early Fleischer Betty Boop or Popeye cartoons in their overall tone. The dvd transfer is generally excellent, although there are some cartoons which use older prints as a source. However, they do not detract from enjoying this disc . Since there is a limited audience for this kind of stuff, grab this dvd before it is out of print
