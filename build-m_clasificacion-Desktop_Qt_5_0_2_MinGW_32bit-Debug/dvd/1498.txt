 If you liked "Mr. Show" on HBO, you'll enjoy this movie. I understand that it takes a certain type of sense of humor to appreciate this kind of seemingly senseless humor. David Cross and Bob Odenkirk are an amazing comic pairing and they've produced some great comedy together over the years. I thought this movie was funny. The characters played by Cross and Odenkirk are based on a skit they did on "Mr. Show". They've developed them and stretched them to ridiculous lengths to create an entire film based on the simplistic personality of Ronnie Dobbs - the mullet-wearing hick rebel who can't keep himself from getting into trouble and being arrested. I would say the highlight of the film would have to be the R&B montage they created for Ronnie's love scene with Nikki Cox's character. It's hilarious. Plenty of star cameos in this movie help it along. It has its moments, but I don't believe it's the best movie Cross and Odenkirk have in them. DVD includes a few deleted scenes and not much else.
