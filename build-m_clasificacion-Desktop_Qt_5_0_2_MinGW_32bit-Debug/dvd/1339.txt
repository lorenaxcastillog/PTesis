 ***** This is a movie all should watch to understand love. Ostensibly about the deterioration of a brilliant writer from Alzheimer's Disease, this movie is really the story of love...how love changes over time, and especially,...how love changes with the ravages of Alzheimer's. It sensitized me to the gift that each person in our lives has to offer---young or old---sick or "well". I have a family member who is inflicted with illness whom I love and this film inspired me to continue on, to love better. The acting is flawless. I didn't realize until I watched the special features in the DVD that the male lead was played by two different actors (one younger, one older)...and the transformation of Kate Winslet (the younger Iris) into Judi Dench (the older Iris) was perfect. This is a film we all should own...and watch...again and again...to fully understand true love---which increases with age and familiarity, but is incredibly complex. Words cannot describe this film, which I would rate a "10" out of "5". If you have read this far---go ahead, buy...or rent, then buy..."Iris". ****
