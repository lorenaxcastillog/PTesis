 The first thing to keep in mind about this wonderfully macabre Halloween horror flick is that the plot has very little to do with Washington Irving's original story, in which Ichabod Crane was a schoolmaster, not a New York City detective sent upstate to solve a series of murders. Having said that, though, Tim Burton's film is a beautifully scary piece of work. (He has said he deliberately included a lot of the feel of Disney's 1949 animated version.) I love Johnny Depp's slightly histrionic, over-the-top performance as the neurotic Constable Crane -- and the wild-eyed Christopher Walken is perfect as the Hessian swordsman with teeth filed to points. I don't think Christina Ricci is all that attractive so I don't find her a convincing love interest, but whatever. Among the excellent supporting cast, Ian McDiarmid ("Senator Palpatine") and Miranda Richardson are especially good, and Christopher Lee even has a small part. The cinematography is dark and stormy, the trees are gnarled, and Danny Elfman's score is quintessentially spooky
