 Laurence Jameson (Caine) is a con-man, hustling rich corupt women out of thousands by lies and decept. Freddy Benson is also a con-man, hustling your average everyday woman out of a meal or two here and there...but when the two of them end up in the same place at the same time they realize they have competition, and when Freddy realizes how much Laurence really makes off these women, well, he wants just as much. The two decide to work together resulting in one of the funniest chain of events in movie history...whether Martin is playing Ruprecht (the monkey boy) or Officer Benson, the man crippled by memories of his fiance dancing naked with the host of Dance America, Martin is absolutly histarical. Caine has a dry humor that works well when bouced off of Martins charisma. I'm not a Caine fan but here he works well and casting can be forgiven since the script is tight and yes, Martin is brilliant. Highly recomended...this will make you laugh out loud and Ruprecht will make you laugh so hard you will cry
