 All I can say is wow! This is Ricky Schroeder? No way! Rick does an unbelievable job in this movie and proves himself to be a true actor worthy of extreme praise. The story line is excellent and true to the actual event the movie is based upon. They spent the time and got all the details right on this one, the historical accuracy is extremely impressive. This is not a "chick flick" as it has a lot of intense close quarter combat, which is not the case with many modern WWII films. That makes some parts of the movie a bit graphic and nasty, but WWI was graphic and nasty. The hand-held camera work is a bit jumpy and almost too over-the-top in trying to place you "into" the action at times, but the movie is certainly good enough to overcome the overzealous camera work. If you want to know something of WWI combat, there's not a better movie out there right now - at least that I know of. With all due respect to "All Quiet On The Western Front" of course - both versions. The Lost Batallion should be in any military enthusiast's collection.
