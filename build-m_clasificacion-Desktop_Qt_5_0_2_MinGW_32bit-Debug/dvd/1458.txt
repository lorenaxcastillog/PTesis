 I recently saw "Goodnight and Good Luck" and this movie was an excellent companion to that. Both films portray the news media exactly how it is today. When the news is owned by corporations and not the people, you cannot possibly expect to get anything real out of it. The news died the day Fox News came on the air with all it's flashing graphics all over the place and people like Bill O'Reilly who make a living out of lying to people. And even worse, that's the most watched cable "news" channel. This movie gets it right. What's on TV is all an illusion and they'll tell you anything you want to hear because the American people are so uneducated that they don't realize what is and isn't reality. The media has one purpose and one purpose only and that is to make money. Not to tell the truth. If they can make more money telling lies, guess what? That's what they're going to do and that is what they do every single day
