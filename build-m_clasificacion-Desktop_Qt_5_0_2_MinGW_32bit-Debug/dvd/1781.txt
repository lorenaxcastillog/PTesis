 I was so disappointed with this video. I thought it would contain more than it did, but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all. I had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did, but it fell far short. This only contains two very basic sequences - surya namaskara A & B, it doesn't even go into the full series and I do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about. There is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all! The two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses, but this video just stops abruptly at that point... I found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout. As soon as I did it, I felt that I had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home. I ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further
