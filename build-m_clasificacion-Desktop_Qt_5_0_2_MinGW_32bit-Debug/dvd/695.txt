 A truly incredible work. Great concept. Director Vincenzo Natali is difinitely one of the most brilliant directors out there. The film is intelligent, allegorical, and boasts an unbelievable perfect ending (i.e. the final shot of the lone survivor departing the cube, aided by a beautiful piece of music). Incredibly atmospheric and intense, and unlike most movies these days, it leaves many questions unanswered. My knees felt like jelly when the film was over, and I was left staring at the screen long after the credits finished rolling. The film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, from a composer I know nothing of (Mark Korven). There should be a CD soundtrack! A brilliant, intense film. Certainly not for everybody, but one thing is certain: No matter your disposition on the film, there's no denying you will never forget it once you've seen it. One of the best films ever made in my opinion, and deserves so much more than it recieves.
