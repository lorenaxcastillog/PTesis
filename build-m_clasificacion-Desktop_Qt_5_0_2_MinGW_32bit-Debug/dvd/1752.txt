 BACK TO THE FUTURE this experience is as good a movie now, as it was in 1985. back to the future is a rewarding family experience that combines learning about technology and science "no this sucker is electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts for the time distortion field", family values "marty you have got to save your father now, or else he will be ERASED! , erased from existence....." and a fun time into one great experience. If you go to film school, teach those academic idiots a lesson about real filmmaking and talk about back to the future... Filmmaking is NOT an academic exercise, its an experience... yo have to live it, and walk the walk to be a part of it... michael, los angeles, california If a film is not there to have a good time, what the hell is it for?????
