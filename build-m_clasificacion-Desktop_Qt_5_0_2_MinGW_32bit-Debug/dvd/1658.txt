 Bill Murray has been a part of many wonderful films over the years. Broken Flowers is yet another one. The movie starts off pretty slow, I admit. It's slow and boring for about 20 minutes. But then the story picks up about a letter that shows up at his house one day, and it says Bill has a 20-year old son. He doesn't know who sent the letter. His neighbor tracks down the addresses of all the women who might be the mother of the child. It turns out there's four women who it might be. Bill goes on a journey to find the four women and find out which one has the son. Now, with that out of the way, I thought the movie was hilarious. It's not supposed to be realistic- the humor lies in the way Bill interacts with the women. All four of the women turn out to be VERY different from one another, and that's where the plot and the humor kick in. I have nothing more to add except if you like Bill Murray films, give this one a chance. It's very good
