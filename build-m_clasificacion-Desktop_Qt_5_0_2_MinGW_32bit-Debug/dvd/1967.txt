 I've had all his other videos and a couple of bootlegs. I wanted to like Larry. He is a great guitarist, but his written material always seemed a bit schmaltz-e. Like 1 degree towards Barry Manilow which is 1 degree too much. Also the lackys he had with him on past videos didn't help matters either. Finally!!! This DVD is phenominal. Lukather brings the cutting edge with out altering Carlton whom he obviously admires. The rest of the band makes it cook just right. I've never seen Carlton compositions sound so good. Good keyboards, drums and bass too. Not just a bunch of subserviant studio guys with no charachter. They rock and do whatever needs to be done. This video cooks and ""ALL"" the musicians shine. The music is formost and not just a man. This is music. A bunch of equals with good material. That is how it's done
