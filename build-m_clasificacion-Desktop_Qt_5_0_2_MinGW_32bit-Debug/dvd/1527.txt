 If you are undecided about whether to start with a single disc of this great show or go for a multi-disc set, my advice is to go for the set that includes season 1, 2 and the special. (Identified as "The Office - The Complete Collection (First And Second Series Plus Special)"). Once you start, you will end up buying all three anyway, so you might as well save money by buying this set, which in sum costs less than buying individually. The series, the plot, the characters, especially Ricky Gervais, work their way into you consciousness, and you won't let go until you see the full way it plays out, so comic, yet so real and riveting. This is more than just a comedy, it's a world that is created and inhabited by the characters AND by you, the viewer -- they way they draw you in with soliloquies to the camera, and reveal little pieces of themselves. Comic yes, but also drama and character You will be very happy with this purchase
