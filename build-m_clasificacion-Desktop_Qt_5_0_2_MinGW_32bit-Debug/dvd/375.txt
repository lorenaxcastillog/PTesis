 This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest daughter. I love this movie and in my opinion, this is the best Friday movie EVER. The other ones were okay. Basically, this movie shows a typical friday in the "hood" for Craig (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker). In this movie, they have to deal with the neighborhood bully "Debo" who jacks people for their money and "ice". My favorite part of the movie is when drug dealer "Big Worm" sends people to do a "Drive By" in Craig's neighborhood because Smokey was too busy smoking up the weed instead of selling it (which he shouldn't do anyway)! It's hilarious because Smokey screams like a girl the whole time! As it's been said before, the sequels are missing "smokey" the lovable Chris Tucker who will have you sprawled out on the floor laughing! However, Mike Epps does a good job of keeping the jokes coming in the sequels. People, get this movie, it will have you saying, "Thank God it's Friday"
