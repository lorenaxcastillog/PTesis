 Another beautiful job from the dear people at Warner! All the films included have been nicely mastered from fine prints, but "Sweet Bird of Youth" seems a little pale and a shade too dark. No disaster, though! My only real complaint is that two more Tennessee Williams films owned by Warner have been left out of the box. Some people have been upset that titles like "Boom" and "Summer and Smoke" are not included. How could they possibly? They are owned by other companies. Warner Home Video can issue films made by MGM and Warner Bros.,but not those owned by Universal and Paramount. BUT...Warner do have the rights to "The Glass Menagerie" and "Period of Adjustment"! Why these were not included in this box is a mystery! So please, Warner, do not forget to issue them as soon as possible! And with some good will from Universal and Paramount regarding "Boom" and "Summer and Smoke", the Tennessee Willams list of films would be complete on DVD! Well, I suppose we have to campaign for "Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots" too
