 I have this recorded on a DVD and have watched it many times. I actully think I like it better than the 1993 version of The Secret Garden. I never did buy the uncle character in the first one and that kinda ruined the movie for me. All the characters in this movie are buyable to me, and the movie is lighter than the kinda dark original. The scenery is just as good as the original, the colors even more brilliant. The magic is still there and this has as many moving moments as the original does. Camilla Belle's part is as good as Kate Maberly's part was and she plays her role as good as Maberly did. They bring back a few of the people from the original which is always good to see, though I don't know about Mary being married to Collin in this one, they were blood relatives in the first. If you liked the original you should like this too
