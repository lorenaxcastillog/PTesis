 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character. It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene. The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars. The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story. Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities." They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one
