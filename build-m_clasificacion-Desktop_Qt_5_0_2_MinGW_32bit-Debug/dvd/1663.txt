 Contrary to what some believe the Grape family depicted here is not dysfunctional. Rather they are a loving one that hold together despite personal tragedy. Director Lasse Hallstrom relates their story with the correct degree of understatement and virtually no sugar coating. The film is aided by a superb cast. Johnny Depp is stupendous as the taciturn title character who is the rock and support mechanism of the Grapes after the absence of the father. Darlene Cates is a real find as the morbidly obese Momma. Cates evokes the tragedy of her character with little pathos. The best performance here comes from Leonardo DiCaprio as the mentally handicapped Arnie. I cannot recall a performance in any other film where retardation was presented so realistically and it's even more amazing when considering DiCaprio's relative youth at the time. The American heartland is also beautifully lensed by Ingmar Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist. In a word, essential viewing
