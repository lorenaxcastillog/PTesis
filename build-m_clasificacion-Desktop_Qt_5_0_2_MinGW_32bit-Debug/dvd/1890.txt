 nick and jessica are a beautiful couple... now with their recent tabloids about them on the verge to splitting is non-sense... they are a power couple... this varitey hour was sooo friggin funny. jessica is a decent actress. the funniest scene was when jessica was trying to be in the MICKEY MOUSE CLUB and they had the younger britney, christina and justin in it trying to get crunk with the gal...OHHH and the pole vaulting.... jessica you know that was wrong but that was another funny moment.... they had a bunch of singing scenes including the jewel and jessica duet 'who will save your soul', nick and babyface and the at the time hit 'take my breathe away'... nick is a funny cat he knows how to keep his gal in the spotlight. he does not try to hog it because he knows that the people really want to see jessica... so i commend him for that. in other words this is funny and i really hope they do another one real soon... ohh they did the christmas one.... but do another one soon...
