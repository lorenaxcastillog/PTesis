 This is a great workout. It's only 35 minutes long but I can always feel it in my [...]and thighs the next day. I am definitely not a 'jump-up-and-down-and-say-yeah' aerobics person but this is a great exception. Ellen Barrett cues very well and she's enthusiastic (using the word 'beautiful!' quite liberally) but she's not annoying. The setting is gorgeous and the music doesn't dominate over Barret's cues. Also, the girl with dark hair is so consistently high-energy that it's motivating- I don't think I've ever seen anyone smile so much. This is a great workout though it is brief (why I didn't give it full 5 stars). This is good because you feel like you zip through it quickly, but I think I'd get more out of it if it was longer (there's an obviously relationship here). But who knows- I break a sweat doing it so maybe if it was longer it would be overwhelming. In summary, this is great and highly recommended- I love it
