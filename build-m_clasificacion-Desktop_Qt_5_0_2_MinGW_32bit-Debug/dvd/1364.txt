 I don't know how it is that some very good movies get sidetracked when they are first released. This is one of them and it is well worth watching and owning, in my opinion. Of course, as a previous reviewer noted, it is NOT a re-do of the famous radio show and if you expect it to be, you will be very confused by it. No, this comedy is very much its own black-and-white story and a hilarious commentary on the prejudices and preconceived notions that are to be found even among the most supposedly enlightened of us. The whole comedy stems from erroneous assumptions made about a black man seen in an empty house in a posh NY community at night (he is, of course, the new owner). Both Samuel L. Jackson and Nicholas Cage (cast as a down-at-heels drifter pressed into service by the local sheriff) play their parts to perfection and Dabney Coleman and the cast of supporting characters are also excellent in their various roles as bumbling law dogs, neighbors, reporters, etc. In sum, I found this underrated film to be not only extremely funny but a wise and wry social commentary as well.
