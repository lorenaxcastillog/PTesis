 So Close, and yet so far. I have been watching Swamp Fox since I was a kid. Unfortunately, one horrible night, I accidently hit the record button when the tape my dad had it on was in the VCR. We lost 2 and a half epidodes!!!!!! Maybe 1 and a half, but all the same, I have always grieved the loss. Anyhow, My little bro saw this in the store and started dancing. Much to my dismay, however, when I investigate it, I find not only not all the episodes, but they are out of order!!!!!!! How could this happen? As for Elfego... He is great too. My dad also had him on recordings, and we watched him all the time. So this was a doubly pleasant surprise.... until I read the details. ONLY 3 BLOOMIN EPISODES????? You have got to be kidding me!! And they are out of order as well. Disney, You were so close to getting $30 of my money, and you just lost it...
