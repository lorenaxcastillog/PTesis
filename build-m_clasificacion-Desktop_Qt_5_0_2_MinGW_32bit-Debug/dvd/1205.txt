 I love a good ab workout. You can never have too many. Because you need to do abs so often, variety is key for not getting bored. This is a good workout to add to your collection. Tracey York is a good instructor and she does another great job here. She begins by alternating two minutes of toning with five minutes of cardio (always keeping your heart rate up). There is crunches, pilates, core-conditioning and "dynamic movement" (they're all short but tough). Because your heart rate is up a lot and you are doing toning, that's the best way to burn the fat and tone together which is more effective in the long run. This workout is very well choreographed which makes it fun. Again, you need dumbells here too. The one problem I have with this, which you'll need to think about too, is that you may already have this because it's a re-release of Shape Your Abs from last year. The cover has changed in a ploy to sell more copies. I like this cover best though so I'm going to sell my original copy. Just don't buy this dvd if you already have last years copy.
