 Kagemusha is not a 5 star movie. It is a big step down from Ran (which is very similar in many aspects, but has a great story) and Seven Samurai (a very different and more comedic, earlier movie by Kurosawa). Kagemusha has two major problems. The story is quite simplistic, a big problem with a three hour movie. Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie. But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle. There's a lot worth remembering in Kagemusha, but the crazy ending, unfortunately, sticks in the mind. The Criterion edition is of excellent quality. The transfer and sound quality are first-rate, and the additional material is interesting and well done. Add-ons cannot make a 4-star movie, even so, into a 5-star experience. There are many positive aspects to Kagemusha, and any Kurosawa fan will be happy with this DVD set. But for those new to Kurosawa, I strongly recommend Ran or Seven Samurai instead
