 The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a well-written thriller that features an all-star cast at its very best. Walter Matthau palys a transit system cop. Robert Shaw, & Martin Balsam put on a tour de force performance as the heavies. Instad of robbing the train and its passengers, they hold a New York subway train full of people hostage. They only want money--and they'll give New York only one hour before they begin killing hostages...but they bit off more than they can chew in the person of Transit Cop Lt. Zachary Garber (Matthauy). His wisecracking, life's-a-joke style helps him do the impossible--find a way to cut through a bankrupt city hall's politics, obtain the million dollar ransom demanded by the hijackers, and deliver it--all within the one hour limit. This is a fast-paced, intense, fun film that stands the test of time. If you want a gripping story and performance with mild language, this is the one for you. As Garber says: "Aw, go play with your trains, Frank!
