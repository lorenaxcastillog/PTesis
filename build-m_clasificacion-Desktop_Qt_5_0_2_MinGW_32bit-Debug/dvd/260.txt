 I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all. It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film. Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made. But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself. Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film. BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'. So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film
