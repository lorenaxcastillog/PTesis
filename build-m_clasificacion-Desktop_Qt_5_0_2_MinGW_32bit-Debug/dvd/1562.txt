 Universal did a really good job on this one. This has to be one of the greatest movie purchases I ever made in my life. You are basically getting three movies for the price of one. And these are some excellent movies. Obviously, The Mummy is probably the best move of the three. To this day I have never met anyone that didn't like this movie. The Mummy Returns was pretty good too. It is one of those movies that dives into the plot way too fast, but don't let that stop you from buying it. It is still an overall good movie. The Scorpian King is a suprisingly good movie as well. The Rock really was phenominal. You will love it. All this and I still haven't even mentioned the collector's box. It is prbably the best you will ever find. Real good quallity, not just some old cardboard wrapped around some DVDs like some other sets. This is just an overall good purchase.
