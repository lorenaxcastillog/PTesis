 It is a pleasure to watch The Beatle's film "Help." It's easy listening, lighthearted and a nice "snapshot" in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game! All the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie. Nevertheless, to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of John Lennon is worth the purchase on it's own! But to know that this was one of the first exposures of Indian music for George Harrison, and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life, is an extremely rare treat indeed. Ringo Starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and Paul McCartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a love-struck member of the band with the lovely leading High Priestess. A must see for new and renewed fans alike
