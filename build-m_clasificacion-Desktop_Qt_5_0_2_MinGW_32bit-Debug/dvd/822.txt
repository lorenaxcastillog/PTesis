 Those familiar with the Criterion's laserdisc edition of _Secret Honor_ (from the early '90s) will recognize most features on this DVD release. Even the essay by Michael Wilmington is the same. The only truly new item here is a 2004 interview with actor Philip Baker Hall -- who is the sole onscreen actor in this film. Hall gives a blistering, memorable performance in this film, and it's fascinating to hear how it was accomplished. _Secret Honor_ is one of Altman's least-known movies. It was obviously shot on a shoestring budget, but it's marvelous nonetheless: The low budget even gives the film a certain gutter charm. Although this film (like most of the director's work during the '80s) was based on a drama, its long takes and frantic camerawork keep it from appearing stagy or contrived. Since this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, I'd suggest you rent _Secret Honor_ before you buy
