 This charming and delightful film is the glittering obverse of that horrible downer, Midnight Cowboy. New York is dreamy, the clothes are gorgeous, Hepburn is unbearably lovely and appealing, Peppard is steady and straight. The characters develop through the film, they grow in maturity and substance. Peppard ditches his humiliating life as a parasite, and gets a job. Hepburn, who is what used to be called a B-girl (I think), not a prostitute or a call-girl or an escort, finally sheds the sleaze and finds true love. In the 30s she might have been a Manhattan baby. Moon River is about as different from that dreadful whiney thing in Cowboy as it possibly could be, written by the unmatchable Johnny Mercer. The only rats are the punters and snobs, and the hornily heartless middle-aged lady. There's a bit of Sweet Charity and Pretty Woman, as well as Cabaret, in the story; but this bubbling froth, with bite and feeling, rises to top the lot. Take your pick, folks, I know which one I'm going for. Audrey forever.
