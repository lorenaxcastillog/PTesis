 Well , this is indeed a wonderful colection. Here is three (3) DVD's put together for your viewing needs. First is Stricly Ballroom, my least favorite of the three. This is however a great movie, the acting, and directing are above most. Then is the powerful, Romeo + Juliet. This is a most visual movie. The best use, of color, lighting, and camera angles, I've seen in a long time. The story is nothing new, two lovers, torn apart by family disputes. but Baz has taken the story and has made it his own, with the use of such bold imagery, and a mix of mordern, with the old. (...) Lastly is the movie Moulin Rouge. WOW! Baz has done it again, this is an other visual mastery. The story is yet another love story, but again Baz has created something which is impossible to look away from. In the end this is a collection that is a must have, so ge it, watch it, and enjoy
