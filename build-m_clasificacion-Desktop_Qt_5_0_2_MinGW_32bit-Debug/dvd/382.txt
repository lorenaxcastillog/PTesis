 THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST, SILLY, TOTALLY MISDIRECTED MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED "DISASTERS IN NATURE MOVIES". I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED. THIS WAS TRULY A HORRIFIC CATASTROPHE. THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS.....WAS..... WAS.....I AM GETTING THERE.............. THE STORY HAD NO MEANING. ADRIENNE BARBEAU SHOULD SELL RAFFLE TICKETS THE NEXT TIME SHE NEEDS MONEY. HER TALENTS WERE TOTALLY WASTED. HERS WAS THE ONLY TALENTS BEING WASTED; NO ONE ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD ANY. THIS DVD ALSO WILL DO NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, AS IT IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE. IF RYAN STARR WANTS AN OSCAR SHE'D BETTER START BY ASKING HIM OUT ON A DATE, BECAUSE JULIA ROBERTS AND HALLE BERRY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTIME SOON. SHE DOES HAVE POTENTIAL THOUGH. THERE WAS NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE BAND MEMBERS. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEIR ACTIONS. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF THIS SEWAGE ON SCREEN
