 The best part about this DVD is the features, particularly the interviews with Dawkins and Doherty. The director otherwise comes off as a preachy, smug arsehole, who gets a kick out of making fun of fundamentalist Christians, which is like shooting dead fish in a barrel. the film itself is awful, mostly bad graphics, worse soundtrack and awful clips from old 50s Christ dramas. Awful stuff. The big finale occurs when the director gets into an argument with a Christian school superintendent. Superintendent: It's a matter of faith. Director: But where's the evidence? Superintendent: We're teaching faith and love. Director: You're teaching lies!!! The superintendent, discovers that the director had misrepresented himself and the purpose of the interview and walks off in a huff. Apparently that proves Christ is a myth. Obviously the director had no idea how to transfer the concept of the mythical Christ to film. Read Challenging the Verdict instead
