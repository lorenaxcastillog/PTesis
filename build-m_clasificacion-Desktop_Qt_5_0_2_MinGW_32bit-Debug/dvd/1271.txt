 A Man For All Seasons is a marvelous period film driven by Robert Bolt's trenchant script and superb acting by Paul Scofield playing Sir Thomas Moore who must by conscience oppose the desires of King Henry the VIII (played by Robert Shaw). It is the only film in my memory that depicts the virtue of integrity with such poigancy that you'll take a look at yourself and wonder how firmly you would hold on to your beliefs when faced with dire consequences if they were asserted. You'll want to see the film repeatedly to savor its intelliegence, crisp direction by Fred Zinneman, and authentic looking sets and costumes. Among the film's gems is the music (I don't think it was ever released on cd). Undoubtedly the film is not entirely historically accurate but it does make it eminently clear what a man of integrity can be. A Man For All Seasons richly deserved the 6 Oscars it captured including best film of 1966.
