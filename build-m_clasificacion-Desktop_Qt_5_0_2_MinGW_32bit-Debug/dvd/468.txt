 Shortened version: Don't buy this DVD unless you have an incredible memory. Long version: My daughter started playing the DVD and sat and waited, because the actual dancing part wasn't for a bit. When the actual dancing part happened, Paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it. Of course, my daughter couldn't keep up. Then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it. After my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part, Paige told us to put it all together and do both parts. And yet again, my daughter couldn't keep up. It was when my daughter was watching Paige "demonstrate" the moves before doing them that I realized that my daughter isn't getting much excersize out of the DVD. I WOULD NOT recommend this DVD to anyone, especially to little kids, who would definetly not keep up to Paige's high memory rate
