 I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material. There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live. All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s). What a shame
