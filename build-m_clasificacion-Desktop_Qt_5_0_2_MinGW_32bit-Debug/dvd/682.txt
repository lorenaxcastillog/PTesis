 To hear the stories of the south, being a visitor down there, living in the North - it brings so much life to what my girlfriend tells me about the south. The south is like no other. It is a beautiful, story-rich part of the country to which there is no other. When they are in the barber shop and the lady begins to sing a small chorus "...First there was a funeral, then there was a trial, hung me up in the courtyard there, let me hang up there awhile, for a while..." - her voice raw and true to herself. Beautiful. As is the girl playing Amazing Grace with a saw and a bow. The banjo playing in the beginning by the man in the woods is equally BEAUTIFUL and soul touching. If you are to watch any documentary and like to hear stories "and stories is everything" this is the movie for you. Not only do you hear about the trials and tribulations about the south, but the beauty behind religion... See it, love it, recommend it
