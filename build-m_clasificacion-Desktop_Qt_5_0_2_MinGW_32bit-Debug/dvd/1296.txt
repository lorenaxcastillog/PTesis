 This hit series sixth season will probably be most remembered for its cliffhanging sequence in which we find out just how close Grissom is to one of his staff members. Hints are evidenced throughout the season so it's not really a surprise, but effective. William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger seem to be less visible during this season, leaving much of the work to the talented co-stars: George Eades, Gary Dourban(whose character ties the knot); Jorja Fox, Louise Lombard, Paul Guilfoyle (exceptionally good this season); Eric Szmanda and Robert David Hall. There are some clever stories this season including takes on werewolves, eating disorders, gang killings, etc. There are also some nice guest turns from Oscar winner Faye Dunaway, Veronica Cartwright and Currie Graham. The background on forensics continues to be fascinating and even though GRAY'S ANATOMY is getting more viewers this season, there's still millions of folks still fascinated with Grissom's Gang
