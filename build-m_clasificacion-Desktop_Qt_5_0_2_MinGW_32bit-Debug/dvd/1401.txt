 The first time I did this I was like no way am I ever going to be able to get into some of these poses! I however love the calm and very warm way that Sara works through the poses. After several weeks of working with this DVD I can get into all but one of the poses, The Eagle Pose (which I am going to blame on short legs and arms). I feel the flexibility and love the way I feel stretched out after I finish. I love using the ball for my workouts as it supports my back and helps me to get into poses that I might not have ever been able to do! The pace is slow and steady and you go from easy into more challenging and then cool down! It is a great DVD for people who have never done yoga before and want to use their ball in their workouts
