 Talk about a veinly camouflaged movie about a President; Turn around the situations and names, and you got President Clinton dead on!! You have this southern governor who is charismatic,handsome and married; Yet, no one knows him and he starts a campaign and slowly builds momentum and popularity; Yet, things dogs his campaign; His wife's hairstylist claims a long time affair, his black friend who owns a BBQ restaurant daughter is pregnant by him, when his main opponent has a heart attack in the middle of an on the air debate, things seems to look bad before it's begun, and his longtime manager, who has had mental challenges kills herself after a moral issue comes up; Very interesting movie; You can see Travolta take on this persona so well; Shucks you see Jack Staton(Bill Clinton) shine through and is believable; Emma Thompson as the smart yet cold wife is also quite good considering she's English; Billy Bob Thornton's role was the scene stealer; the part when he says he comes from slaves and all, it just makes you shake your head; Very good political flick
