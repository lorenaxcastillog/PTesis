 Aside from the fact that one of the discs was cracked when I got this set (which Amazon promptly replaced with no hassle)this is a chronicle of an ambitious effort by rock and rollers who seemed to care and others who wanted to ride the coattails of those people. If you are looking for all the artists that played and all the songs from Live Aid this is NOT the set for you. In fact there's been some audio recreation on this set which I don't think is even mentioned in the collection. I felt gyped but you can read about it in Wikipedia's listing for Live Aid. Good performances by U2, Bowie and Queen as is expected but some of the other 80's acts are HORRID! I was at Live Aid and had no sentimentality for this package. The good thing is that this set promises to give some of the money to the Band Aid effort, though where that money will eventually end up is as mysterious as where Led Zeppelin's fottage wound up
