 A really exquisite movie that will make you laugh, cry, and keep putting it on again for more The movie is about a girls school in Paris and the adventures of 12 adorable little girls, with the cutest and most interesting of all being the plucky flame haired little tyke, with a heart of gold Madeline (Hatty Jones). With adventures taken from the timeless books, including little Madeleine's appendicitis, and her rescue from the water by the golden retriever Genevieve, the centerpiece of the story is the battle of the girls and their loving guardian Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) to keep their school and their dog, against the cruel plans of Lord Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and also foiling a thuggish tutor cum kidnapper Leopold (Ben Daniels) This is really beautiful, not only for kids, but for all young at heart aged 2 to 122 years of age. There are just so many wonderful memorable heart-stealing scenes, funny cute and poignant.
