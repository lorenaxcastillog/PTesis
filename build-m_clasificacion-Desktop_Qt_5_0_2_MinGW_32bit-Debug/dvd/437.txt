 This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great. The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors. But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding! It's equally interesting to judge what didn't work in this movie: the characters, not quite as weak as those in the book but close; many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake; and of course the bulk of the book's great science got lost. But still, none of this really matters that much. The scary scenes were awfully scary! Those dinosaurs looked REAL! I can watch those scenes over and over and over again; so owning a quality DVD like this makes it easy! If you don't have it already, Give it a shot!
