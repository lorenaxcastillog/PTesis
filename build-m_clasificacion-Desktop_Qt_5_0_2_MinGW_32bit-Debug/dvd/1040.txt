 I am really surprised by how much I love this workout! Since having my daughter I have been either too busy or too tired to even think about returning to the gym, but I am so out of shape I knew that I had to do something. What I love most is the flexibility that this DVD offers. I choose not to walk with the CD that comes wit the program. I just oush the stroller as fast as I like for 30 to 45 minutes. (I live in the desert southwest, so this part is easy for me.) When I return to the house, I plunk my daughter in her highchair, put her dinner on her tray and while she eats she squeals at the objects that pop up on the screen. The toning part is my favorite, though. I love that I can easily repeat segments so that I can focus harder on a certain muscle group if I like. After doing this workout the first time, I was a little sore the next morning. That was all the push I needed to continue! I highly recommend this workout to ANYONE...not just new mothers!
