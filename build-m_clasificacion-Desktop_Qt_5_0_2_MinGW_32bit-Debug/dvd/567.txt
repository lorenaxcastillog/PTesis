 What stands out most in Mike Nichols' production of Angels in America in the performaces. Al Pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way. No one else really talked about Belize played by Jeffrey Wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill (not to mention his amusing depiction of Mr. Lies). Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending. Each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play. But the fully realized characters are what you should come to see
