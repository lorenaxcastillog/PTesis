 Eternal Sunshine proves that there can still be originality in Today's Hollywood. Charlie Kaufman conquers the very difficult task of weaving an intricate, touching tale about the complexities of love and how, in a moment of anger or heartache, we can take for granted our most precious memories and destroy the very best things experienced in life. Michel Gondry and his team saw to it that every trick of the lens, every visually stunning moment worked to enchance the heart of the story and therefore deserves every one of the five stars celebrating their celuloid triumph. Same goes for the actors, who do such a beautiful job with their performances, you'd never know their characters came from words on a page. Jim Carrey deserves special attention as his performance was an understated tour de force, in my opinion - as was Kate Winslet's, and the unlikely pairing making the story all the more surprising and enjoyable. I recommend this be a film in everybody's personal film library - the message is universal and a story as well executed as this one will live on for generations, never growing outdated or stale.
