 I fell in love with this movie after the first time I saw it! it is simply impossible to explain the real value of this movie... it is a great story with many meaning that the previous reviews emphasized on. I have to mention that the picture is simply grabbing! every detail perfectly put into place... the scenary magnificant... I would watch it over and over again because I simply can't get enough of the beauty of this movie. The wheat lawn seems to have a symbolic meaning as well. I think it represents childhood and innocence and in the end of the movie you can see how childhood ends or is acually "killed". The acting could be indded improved in certain moments but it overall effect shifts the attention from that. i like the portrait of the Italian society of 1978 (which seems so realistic in that certain part of Italy
