 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. Ran is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear and remains one of Kurosawa's most popular films. It is about an aging feudal lord who divides his land between his three sons. The elder sons are satisfied and the younger one becomes corrupt. The film is very well made and includes an excellent scene of a burning castle that was constructed and burned solely for the film. The costumes are also very well designed and there are many other things about this film which make it very good. The Criterion DVD has some excellent special features too. Disc one contains the film with optional audio commentary by Stephen Prince, theatrical trailers and an introduction by Sidney Lumet. Disc two contains "A.K." a film about Kurosawa directed by Chris Marker, a segment of "Akira Kurosawa: It's Wonderful to Create" about the making of the film, an interview with actor, Tatsuya Nakadai, and a 35 minute montage of storyboard paintings and sketches
