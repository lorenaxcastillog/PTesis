 In one of my classes, we studied the infamous "twinkie defense," and I was enthralled by the whole ordeal. Wanting to learn more, I rented this dvd, and was not disappointed. I was transferred back to a time when the political scene was changing, and gays were just starting to "come out of the closet." The story of a young [...] NY Jewish camera salesman who fled to SF in the 60's and through passion & elbow grease managed to become the first openly gay man elected as Supervisor was somewhat inspiring. The documentary builds up the story expertly up to the unfortunate end. I took off 1 star because I wanted them to talk more about how the jury selected was conservative because the prosecution WANTED a conservative jury, in hopes they'd get the death penalty. Instead of blaming THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, by my reasoning, I'd blame the prosecution for bad judgement in selecting the jurors. Anyways, while I may not have agreed politically with Harvey Milk on most issues, I still admire the passion he displayed in fighting for his cause. This is a must-see for all documentary and "court tv" lovers.
