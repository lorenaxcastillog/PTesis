 Unlike the curmudgeon above, I enjoyed this movie because I took it as it was intended, a children's movie. I have a 6 year old daughter who is exposed incessantly to appeals to the lowest common denominator in the form of twisted concepts of human sexualtiy, myopic schooling, and rank commercialism, amongst others. I am attempting with everything in me to rear a daughter with self confidence, intelligence, and above all the will to express herself in the face of adversity. While I have substantial concern with the setting of Eloise, the underlying themes of the film I believe supercede the lifestyle of privlege portrayed. These themes are independence of thought, self confidence, innocence as a power for good, and the triumph of the free thinker over social castes. It is indeed pablum, but pablum is extremely beneficial in it's context. This film is light hearted, amusing, shallow, and utterly enchanting for the young at heart, including reluctant adults. Disney has it's place, and should not be rearing our children, but for a parent with interest in their child's upbringing, able to reinforce the beneficial aspects of the film, this quintessentially Disney movie is entirely pleasant. Peace, Someone's Daddy
