 I have been dying for this season to come out because it has several key episodes. The one where Homer's car gets impounded by the world trade center AND the one where he climbs the mountain. It's not that these episodes are the best ones ever, but they both contain certain parts that I find very funny. I wish this was coming out sooner; Dec. 19th is a little too close to Christmas for those of us that like to get our holiday shopping done early. But, this is still a great season. I am so sick of people saying "Oh, this season is when the Simpsons went downhill." If you think you can keep an animated show fresh and funny after eighteen years better than the writers have, then I invite you to submit your resume to Fox and do it. If you can't do a better job, then quit complaining because fans like me don't care to hear your insignificant opinions. This is THE greatest show on TV and will be for years to come
