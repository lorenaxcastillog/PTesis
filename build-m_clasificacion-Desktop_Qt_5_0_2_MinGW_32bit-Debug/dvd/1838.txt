 The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews. I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD. They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW. I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info. Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection. I just wish they added more matches and interviews. TNA better watch themselves.
