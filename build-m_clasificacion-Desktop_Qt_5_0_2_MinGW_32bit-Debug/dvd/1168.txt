 The movie is lovely, the extras in the disc are great and the price is good, whether used or new. Even has commentary by Nancy Kwan and film historian Nick Redman. The film is about Mei Li, played by Miyoshi Umeki, who comes from Hong Kong to the United States for an arranged marriage with a night club owner played by Jack Soo. But he already has his eye on Linda Low played by Nancy Kwan, a modern gold digger who is willing to do anything to get that gold ring on that empty finger. So he tries to dump Mei Li on an old fashion family looking for an old fashion girl to marry the eldest son played by James Shigeta. There is also Helen Chao, played the lovely Reiko Sato, who has a job, has loved the eldest son for years, isn't interested in money or marrying just to get married and guess who ends up without a man in the end? Poor, poor girl. Besides that it is a fun 2 hours and 12 minutes.
