 Fans Only is really a collection of videos, interviews, and guest appearances that are woven throughout - randomly it seems at times - but the structure of it all is still exciting enough to hold your attention, especially if you are new to the videos. As far as the interviews went, the dvd begins with introducing the band in casual interviews during their everyday routines. Then, the majority of the documentive material is more of a here-and-there placement, within the studios and during shoots. There are also a couple guest show appearances and performances. I have to point out that there were some really nice moments on the dvd with the motion graphics, including a couple pieces specifically during the end. One is a montage where raw photos and screenshots from various inspirations are cropped in on to become some of the band's album covers and artwork. Running time: 136 mins (2hrs 16 mins
