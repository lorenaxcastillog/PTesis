 This season turned in some good episodes, but nothing like the gems of Season Three, the best of the series in my opinion. Dissapointing that Grieco is on the box cover and not in many episode and also dissapointing that one of the best episodes of this season "Blackout" is being held hostage. I suppose, like one reviewer said, that it will come out on S5 which is bogus just so we'd buy that crappy last season. I think I'll pass. Regardless, this was the beginning of the end for Depp but I think he still gave wonderful performances. (hard for him not to) I still can't believe the box covers and how Depp is clearly favored. Interesting. If you only want to spend money on one season, go for Season Three. With Depp in his prime; writing and stories top notch and the intro of Booker, plus steller episodes like 'Blinded by the Thousand Points of Light', 'Swallowed Alive' and 'Fun with Animals' you can't go wrong. This season is strictly for the fans, but even the fans got the shaft. Comes in for Silver, but not the Gold
