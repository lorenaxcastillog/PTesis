 I was very touched by this movie. It was not the actual story/plot, or it's accuracy that was important to me. Rather, what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal Transcendence the main character brings about in his life--from rage, hate, and bitterness, to self caring, willingness to learning, inner directedness, to a sense of spirituality and something "bigger than himself," to forgiveness and "letting go," and then the untimate Transcendence--reaching out, risking trusting others with his core pain, and risking loving others. Also, this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles, determination to care about "the individual" and to rectifying an injustice. I do not know whether or not Rubin Carter murdered those people. From my stand point, this is a movie that models personal healing. It is touching and inspirational--even if it were to turn out to be total fiction
