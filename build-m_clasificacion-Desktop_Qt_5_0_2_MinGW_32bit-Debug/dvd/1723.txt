 I recently bought the widescreen version from Amazon thinking I was going to get the corrected discs. They advertise in the picture the box that has the orange sticker that says lowest price ever. It was my understanding that this particular set with the orange sticker contained the updated discs. They sent me a dvd set that did not have that sticker. I opened the dvd set anyway thinking that maybe this set had the corrected discs. Disc 2 did not say ver. 2. So now I have to go through the hassle of getting the good discs. So becareful ordering these from Amazon, you may get the defective widescreen discs. If anyone is interested, Universal is still offering to send free of charge the updated widescreen discs. The phone number is 1-888-703-0010. Of course this experience has no relation to how good the movies are. They receive 5 stars
