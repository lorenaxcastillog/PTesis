 I can't say anything about this movie that probably hasn't already been said in the other reviews. This true crime story has haunted me ever since I read George Plimpton's book on Truman Capote which is the foundation for the new Capote movie being released this year. If you are a fan of Capote's "In Cold Blood," you will not be disappointed in this behind-the-scenes type movie of how he came to write the book. Hoffman definitely deserved the Oscar for his adaption of Capote which was brilliant. I only wish this movie would have explored a bit more of his feelings that the real Capote had for Smith, one of the convicted. Imagine standing there having to watch someone you so deeply cared about being put to death. Chilling! This movie does a great job of capturing that feeling in the end, but could have used a bit more of it when Capote first met the killers. Otherwise, this movie is enduring magnificence to the saga that is Capote
