 I saw the Sydney version of this concert, so it was very similar to the actual concert I went to. Eagles are just great performers and Henley / Frey some of the best songwriters about (have always loved the cynicism and humour in the lyrics) and they are still great vocalists. Joe Walsh is a genius guitarist and I'm pleased that they included a bit of his stuff in the DVD - eg Rocky Mountain Way. big highlight was "Hotel California" - only shame is that Don Felder is no longer playing with them (maybe Hell might freeze over again in the next farewell tour!) My only criticism is that the DVD contained 2 & 1/2 hours of what was a 3 & 1/2 hour concert and there was room on the 2 disks to fit everything in - so why cut out an hour? After all if it is good enough for the boys to play the songs, why not include everything? Otherwise an excellent recording and I look forward to the next "farewell". (Wish there was more old Eagles footage on DVD as well.....
