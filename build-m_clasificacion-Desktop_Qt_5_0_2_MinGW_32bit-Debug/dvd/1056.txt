 I have to admit, I am the type of homeschool mother who reads reviews before purchasing what I use in training my children. Most of the reviews I read on the Leap Frog Learning DVD'S were positive and BOY were they ever right!! I have a 5 year old (almost 6) daughter who STRUGGLED learning alpha letters and sounds. She had her favorite letters, but I had to sit with her and go over and over and over the others....this was completely frustrating to her and I. That is until we received Leap Frog Learning DVD's 5 pack. These dvd's are educationally and musically stimulating. My daughter learned all of the alphabet sounds in less than a week, FOR REAL! She has taken to singing the songs and sounding out the letters so much that she is driving her brother crazy. She sounds her letters to sleep. She writes the alphabet on everything, upper and lower case. She tells us what a period, exclamation point and a comma is. And of course sings like mad! She has starting reading and LOVES it. This is by far the best money ever spent on teaching materials ~
