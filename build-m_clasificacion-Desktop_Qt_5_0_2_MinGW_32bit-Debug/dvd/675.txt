 WOW!! I wish this video was available when my daughter was born almost 3 years ago! It should be included in every diaper bag from the hospital when the child has Down syndrome! It is all of the information that I wish I knew when my daughter was first born. It is like Down syndrome 101. You don't walk away with a hopeless feeling about your new baby's lease on life, instead, you understand that your child has an extra chromosome, and that chromosome, as small as it may be, WILL be the largest blessing and life lesson you learn. This video will be on the "must see" list for any new parents joining our Down synrdrome playgroup, and I hope NADS and NDSS will add it to their new parent packets....although $35 is a bit steep when you have been hit with a child with special needs, it is well worth a trip to the library!!! Even if you have to special request it via inter-library loan!!!
