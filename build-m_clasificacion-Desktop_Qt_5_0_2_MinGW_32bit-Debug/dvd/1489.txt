 EVIL DEAD's director Sam Raimi, Tim Burton fave composer Danny Elfman and Oscar winner Frances McDormand contribute to elevate this comic book style vendetta drama. Liam Neeson (Oscar nominee for SCHINDLER'S LIST) plays a mild-mannered scientist who is attacked by a bunch of thugs after incriminating documentation held by Neeson's girlfriend McDormand. Left for dead, he manages to get resuscitated by cameo Jenny Agutter, and he embarks on continuing his experiments which dealt with reconstruction of human skin. This also includes vengeance on the men responsible for his attack. Neeson's performance is a little over the top (think Vincent Price) but McDormand is very good as the girlfriend, and Colin Friels and the irrepressible Larry Drake (two time Emmy winner for LA LAW) shine as the nasty villains. Directed with flair by the accomplished Raimi, DARKMAN is one of the earliest vendetta flicks and it still packs a pretty good punch. Watch for Raimi fave Bruce Campbell in a cameo at the end
