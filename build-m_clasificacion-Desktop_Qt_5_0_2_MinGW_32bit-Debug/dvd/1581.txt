 This film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it. The plot is not very intriguing, and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life, so it lacks this sense of reality. A dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer, which is exactly the point of this movie. However, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor. Maybe only comparing to Elijah, but hey, he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever, so no wonder you cannot compete with him... Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for Elijah Wood fans!
