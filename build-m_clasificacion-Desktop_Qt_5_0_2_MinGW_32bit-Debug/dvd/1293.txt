 Where do I start?? I am a 39 year old career-obsessed straight female (lawyer). I fell in love with these guys. Brian (Gale Harold) You are the James Dean of this generation, the man we love, adore, the badboy with a golden heart, who we all fall hopelessley in love with. Brian, Justin, Em,Micheal and Ted. I became absolutely besotted with them and their funny, sad unbelievable stories and watched fixated episode after episode. I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I lived the rollercoaster with them. Buy series 1, you will be hooked just like I was, I have now viewed all 5 and keep going over and over them. It dosent matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you represent. This series is wonderful, and funny and full of love and hope. Its appeal is absolutely universal for all us dreamers and lovers and geeks. Watch it, and weep... I promise you won't be disappointed.
