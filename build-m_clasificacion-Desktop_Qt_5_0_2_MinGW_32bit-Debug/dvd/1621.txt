 Did I say scary? Yeah, this movie is a little scary, not too much though. But it's more frightening than most of today's "scary" movies. It's also much more enjoyable. Bruce Campbell is the ultimate b-movie actor. He has the greatest facial expressions in history. For about 30 minutes during the movie, there are no words, just grunts and facial expressions by Campbell as he's getting attacked by the evil spirits. That part of the movie is great fun. These sequences of Campbell fighting off the spirits show how much of a genius Sam Raimi is. The sequences with Campbell were so good, it's possible to tolerate the non-Campbell parts of the movie. I highly recommend this movie. It is perfect for those nights when friends are visiting and you are all debating what to watch. Chances are they wouldn't have seen this movie and if they did, they'll be excited to know you have it
