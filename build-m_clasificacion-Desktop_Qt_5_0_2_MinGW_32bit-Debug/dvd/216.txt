 Finally, another of my favorite sitcoms is released on DVD! I've enjoyed watching re-run after re-run of this "gem" of a series for years. For quite awhile the first season was not even a part of the syndicated episodes. Barbara Eden is fantastic as Jeannie. Poor Tony Nelson didn't realize how lucky he really was! Larry Hagman played the part of Anthony Nelson with great comedic timing. Larry and Barbara together made a fantastic team! I love the interviews with Barbara, Larry and Bill Daily. Even today, the three of them come across as best friends. It's no wonder they were so good together in the series! I Dream Of Jeannie will always be one of the funniest shows ever to grace our TV screens! I'm not thrilled about the movie version soon to be released- I'll stick with what is best-THE ORIGINAL! Now I will wait for one more of my favorite shows-THE PATTY DUKE SHOW
