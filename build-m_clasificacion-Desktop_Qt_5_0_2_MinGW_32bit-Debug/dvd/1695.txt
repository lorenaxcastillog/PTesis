 Oh so dashing Errol Flynn is Peter Blood, a doctor thrown into slavery without just cause. Fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates! Arrrrrrrgh! Highly entertaining from beginning to end, normally when a film gets boring I bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here! This film didn't let up for a minute. Even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, who by the way is smoking hot in this movie. Another reason to get this DVD or even better yet the Flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called "Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born". Did you know co-star Ross Alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with?! Yikes. Also check out the score by Erich Korngold
