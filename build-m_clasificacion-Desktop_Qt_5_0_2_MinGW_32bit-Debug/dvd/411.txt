 I ordered this DVD with high expectations after reading all the reviews! I've got to tell you... it met all of them. You can choose an all Low level, Moderate level or high intensity workout (which includes abs and full body stretch) or you can truly customize your workout. The DVD lets you preset what level you want for every specific workout before you even start so that there aren't any interruptions between the chapters. I almost hate to admit it but... I choose the Low intensity workout starting out. I was sweating more than what I thought I would. I even still found some of the Abs and thigh exercises challenging!! I think that Denise is EXTREMEMLY motivational and can really help you keep up your momentum. I know many times I would remember to tighten my Abs while exercising with her catch phrase, "Zip up those Abs!!" *I would recommend this to everyone at any fitness level because this is a workout that than "grow" with up as you become more fit! 5 stars from me!
