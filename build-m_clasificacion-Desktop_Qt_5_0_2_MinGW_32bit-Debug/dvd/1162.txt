 The video for itself is a MUST HAVE if u like Westenra's voice. She's fresh. She's nice. She has an angel that flies out of herself continosly... Not only the video quality is great if u have a DVD Home-Theatre 5.1, but the quality in Westenra's voice. I like it when u can hear little breath's in the singer voice so you make sure that there is not some studio recording behind it. In here you can have that. You can make sure with the changes she makes in her tunes that she's singing. She's simple, she's gorgeous. She's going to give you 70 minutes of a great treat. I hope she decides to come on tour soon. Maybe after one more big smash cd... But this is definitively a MUST HAVE in your collection for a tranquil evening at home and go to sleep delighted by this cristal clear voice
