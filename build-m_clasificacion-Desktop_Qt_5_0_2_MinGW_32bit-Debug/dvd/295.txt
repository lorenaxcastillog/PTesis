 This is one of the finest shows ever to be put on television+a prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons. For a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like Family Matters,Americas Funniest Home Videos+Full House are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable. Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in "House". The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking. Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward. Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy. Shows like this are the reason TV was created. The 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a 7-10 year run of the crap on today. This is probably the finest ensemble drama since St.Elsewhere. I would give it 10 stars if I coul
