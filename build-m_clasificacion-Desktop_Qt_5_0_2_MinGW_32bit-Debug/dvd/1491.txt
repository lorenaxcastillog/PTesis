 I don't typically like cowboy/rodeo/country-western movies because those types of things aren't really my style. But this movie was a pleasant surprise; I did enjoy the story, and as a film, it wasn't half bad. It may or may not be a favorite in its genre, but I found it entertaining. Sutherland and Thomas play Hank & Eli quite well, and as usual Daryl Hannah is perfect in her role (who, fittingly, is a vegetarian). Molly Ringwald, I'll admit, did seem a tad useless as the movie went on--not Ringwald herself, exactly, but her character's importance. As far as rodeo movies go, this is a pretty cute one. Celia does sort of fall out of the story too fast, and the entire sad ending is focused on--to me at least--showing the absurdity of riding an animal who can kill you, as a sport. It destroyed not only the dead rider's life but his family's too. Thankfully the bull goes free at the end and does not have to pay with its life for the sad fate of the man.
