 But,now I LOVE it!!! I had a really hard time figuring out the different moves used during the Aerobic sections. So, for awhile, I found myself either marching in place with a lost look on my face, or flying head over spandex off of my fanny lifter. There's not a single workout video (or dvd) that I've liked, until after I've done it once or twice, so I can get the moves figured out. However, this one requred a lot more effort, than usual, before I finally reached that golden moment in which I realized that I knew what to do as she called out each movement! YIPPIE!!! So yes, I do highly recommend this. Emily is a wonderful instructor, and I love the choreography she's come up with for this workout. My favorite part is with the punches, kicks and jabs, great fun! And the music goes great with it! You may find yourself like I was, and in need of some extra time to learn the moves. I recommend you keep trying, until you hit that "A-HA!!!" moment. You'll be so glad you did!!!!
