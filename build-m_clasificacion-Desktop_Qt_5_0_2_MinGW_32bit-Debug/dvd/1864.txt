 Fractured Fairy Tales are not only fantastic classic toons, but they're also great for use in a high school english classroom to illustrate narrative elements! Pair it with the companion book (Fractured Fairy Tales, A.J. Jacobs) with 25 tales for even more fun. I just purchased this disc from Amazon and have enjoyed rewatching these great shorts from my childhood. I couldn't find a list of the included episodes anywhere before purchasing, so here's the rundown in case you're wondering too! The disk includes these 15 episodes: * Rapunzel * The Brave Little Tailor * Rumpelstiltskin * Cinderella * Snow White * Sleeping Beauty * Pinocchio * Ridinghoods Anonymous * The Ugly Duckling * Cinderella Returns * Rumpelstiltskin Returns * Leaping Beauty * The Enchanted Frog * The Pied Piper * The Magic Fish The disk also has some nifty Bullwinkle puppet intros as a bonus, as well as a cute case and menu theme
