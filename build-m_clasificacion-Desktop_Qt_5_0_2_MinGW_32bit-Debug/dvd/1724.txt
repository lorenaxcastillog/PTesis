 When I received this for Christmas the year of its release, I was unaware of the framing issues. I had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements. On top of that, there were warbling sound issues with part 2, and the Michael J. Fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu.(This was reported on many websites) Also, the trailers were all full screen, not widescreen. Apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release. The thing that angers me the most is that since I couldnt return part 1 to universal initially, ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen....ughhhh. I can live with it in fullscreen and I am not gonna exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with Universal. Thanks for nothing......pass this one up until its reissued with new features!
