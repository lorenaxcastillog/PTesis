 There is lot's of issues on this season that make being a gay a lot more easier. I like the thing about gay parenting, because I am gay, and will one day be a father. The gay football player (played by Alec McClure), was wonderful. Esera Tuaolo was one of the very few NFL players to come out. So it was nice for this show to a have a situation like that. Alec was also sexy as hell, which I loved. All the characters were wonderful. There was lot's of nudity and constant orgies, which I enjoyed because of all the nudity. The issues were great on this show. I loved that Ted had blonde hair for a while, and that he had a very different personality from everyone else. He seemd like the mousy one. Brian was so over the top with erotism, that it was sexy yet funny! It's a good show, but if you're straight, you need an open mind to watch this.
