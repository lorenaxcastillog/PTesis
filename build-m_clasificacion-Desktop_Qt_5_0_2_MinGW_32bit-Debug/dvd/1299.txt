 This is an outstanding and hilariously funny comedy. Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci) is excellent as an out-of-place lawyer in the out-of-the-way state of Alabama; where he finds he is out-of-his-elements: Sort of. With his rough and saavy Brooklyn charm, he and Fred Gwynn as the conservative, no nonsense Alabama judge make this a terrific film! The court scenes with Fred Gwynn, and Maury Chaykin were hilarious. I found the film not only great, but the Oscar awarded to Marisa Tomei were well earned. It's a shame Fred Gwynne passed away not too long after the film. He was just starting to do some really good films. Especially after so many years of being typecast as Herman Munster, however, we should all be grateful that he did this film. It would not have been the same without him as the tough judge. I highly recommend this film. It's a great comedy. [Stars: 5+
