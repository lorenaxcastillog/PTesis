 While I very much admired it, let me say up-front that people with short attention spans will not enjoy the Russian film THE RETURN (a.k.a. VOZVRASHCHENIYE). It has a simple storyline, spare dialogue, and long takes. Watching it, one senses allegorical intentions of an almost Biblical proportion after a while. Which is another way of saying that this is an art film. (Albeit a gorgeously filmed and affecting one.) I was very sad to learn that the young man who plays the older brother Andrey (Vladimir Garin) died in a boating accident not long after THE RETURN was completed. This is odd and poignant; as Andrey, he spends a lot of time in a small rowboat. And he was a compelling actor whose face is a fascinating canvas of stubbornness, humor, and hope. (His brother, Ivan Dobronravov also gives a bravura performance.) As to the film, with its mythic aspirations, it could easily have fallen flat. But it doesn't; instead, director Andrey Zvyagintsev's ambitions are realized through the believable acting, gorgeous cinematography, and intentionally open-ended storyline. THE RETURN is not the kind of movie that you love, but you sure do think about it after the credits roll
