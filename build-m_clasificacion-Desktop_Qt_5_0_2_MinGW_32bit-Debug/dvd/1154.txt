 I wouldn't argue how faithful this production is to Austen's masterpiece, but would procliam that it's indisputably one of the most beautiful, balanced and perfect period films set in the Regency Era - and arguably the best filmic example of Austen's works. The lively interplay of Thompson's emphatic Elinor and the youthful Marianne played by Winslet lies central to the success of the film. A succeeding formula crowns the work under the immaculate direction of Ang Lee, the maestro of picture-perfect mis-en-scene with a lush, sublime and stirring score by Patrick Doyle. Like one of the reviewers, I was inducted into this film at a "wrong" age and found it to be a bore. Years later, a foray into "Pride and Prejudice" by Keira Knightley kindered my interest in Jane Austen works adapted for film and eased me into the joys of this marvellous film. While "Pride" by Knightley was a delight to watch, "Sense" is in every sense, a classic to behold.
