 First off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie. When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, "Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?" She looks so sweet and hot that it's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later. However she pulls ift off pretty well. In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well. I couldn't understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing. I give it 5 stars because it's both fun and funny, and of course very hot at times. Well worth a look...
