 Lady and the Trap has been an enduring Disney classic for 50 years now and it's amazing how well it holds up after all that time. The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch. This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best. But calling Lady and the Tramp a great animated film is really selling it short. It's a great MOVIE, period. Lady's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy Tramp comes to her rescue. While he begins his relationship with Lady in the dog house (sorry, couldn't resist), he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end. If you've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans. Watch Lady and the Tramp and you'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years.
