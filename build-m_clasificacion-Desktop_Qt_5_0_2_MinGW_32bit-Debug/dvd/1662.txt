 When I was much younger, I remember watching this with friends (one friend advertised it as "a movie about a really fat lady") and laughing at the mother's obesity. Laughing when the little kids would run up to the window to take a peek at her, laughing at her little feet stomping under the table, laughing when they drove into town and the car was heavily tilted on one side, laughing when she died and they had to burn the house down. I watch it now and try not to think of those things as I once did, although I know I'm still smiling somewhere in the back of my mind. "You don't get that way overnight" and all that. It's so sad, and it ruins the movie for me sometimes - I dwell on Her and often miss more important details. Well, still worth the watch, every time. Dicaprio is stunning
