 I disagree with the opinion of those reviewers who found the editing/photography of the concert captured in this DVD to be lacking. As a matter of fact, I felt the video was even more interesting as a result of it. I got a feel of being in the stage with the band, very close to them as I was watching it, which is not an experience you can typically have even while attending the concert. Musically, the concert offered an assortment of material, both old and new, to wet the appetites of most U2 fans, plus it accomplished what I've never felt at a U2 concert before: a sense of intimacy with the guys in the band and the audience that is odd for an arena show like the United Center where the taping took place. Overall, while not the most innovative show by U2 ever (that would have to be the Zoo TV Tour video), I highly enjoyed it and recommend it
