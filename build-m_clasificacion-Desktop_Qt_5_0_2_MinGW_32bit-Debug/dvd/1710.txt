 I bought this DVD based on Shiva Rea's strong reputation and some amazon reviews, however, I am extremely disappointed. I like the concept of a customized DVD practice but it's not really practical. You spend too much time trying to watch the video while your head should be facing down or up in the poses. Impossible to follow along with out some verbal clues. In addition, you also spend too much time fiddling with the remote if you do want to customize your practice. How "yogic" is that? Almost the antithesis of vinyasa flow. Ideally, you should start a video and then become totally immersed in your practice as if the video is not there - not stop and start and strain your neck. At some point you should never even "watch" the video while doing yoga, just listen and practice. This is impossible with this format. Too bad, because it is very beautiful, has fabulous music and a wonderful spiritual slant in the introduction. A huge disappointment for an experienced yogini and would be even more so for a beginner. Buy the music only or the gorgeous Shiva-designed yoga clothes and do your own practice. Namaste.
