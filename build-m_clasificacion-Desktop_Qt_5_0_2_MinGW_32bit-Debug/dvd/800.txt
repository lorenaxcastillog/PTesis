 What a concept! WOW! This Italian film deals with a scary premise, that for some is all too real. What if the people a child is supposed to trust all conspired to do a great evil--to betray another child? What if you realized as a ten-year old that you stood on higher moral ground than all the adults in your life? What if, in fact, they, and even some of your school friends, were all involved in a horrific conspiracy? And if you found out, what would you do? The acting and plot of this engaging, engrossing movie flow so naturally, you'll think this is a true story. Believability is the huge strength of this compelling film. As a technical side note, the subtitles seemed to be so well done I ceased to notice them. Bottom-line: An excellent story, well-told. The one caution is that the film flows at a natural, and ironically slow pace, considering the underlying action. That is perhaps one of the points. Evil can be done by loved ones, without a lot of flash-bang
