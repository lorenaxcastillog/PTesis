 I just read that this Film "Stone Pillow" was released on DVD and I purchased the DVD Right away! This is a BARGAIN at $9.99! This was such a Brave Role For Lucille Ball to take on and you can tell from her Stunning Performance that this Role was close to her heart! Not Many Actress's would take such a risk but then again Lucille Ball always was a Trailblazer! Lucy of course was always known as a Comedic actress but she proves in this film that she is just as able in a Hard Hitting Drama! I Live in a Big City(LA) and I see homeless people everyday and it is so easy for people to take them for granted . After watching this film, one has a Whole new Perspective on the Homeless problem(which has grown even worse since bush jr took office) and the people who experience it . I Strongly Recommend this film and it is a film that the entire family should watch
