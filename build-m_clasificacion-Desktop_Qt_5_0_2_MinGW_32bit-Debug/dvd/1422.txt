 As a teenager, I was rarely interested in the news or social events but I was riveted by the Patty Hearst kidnapping and faithfully tuned in to the evening news to see what had happened next. It seems odd that no one has made a serious documentary about the sensational events of that time until now. This is a riveting film that traces the development of the SLA (Symbionese Liberation Army), the kidnapping of Patty Hearst, and the group's ultimate demise. The filmmakers make no attempt to analyze whether Hearst was a willing accomplise or victim of brainwashing but instead simply present the facts in chronological order. Interviews with former SLA members Russ Little (an original founder of the group), Mike Bortin and San Francisco Chronicle reporter Tim Findley highlight the film which also features footage from newscasts and the infamous Patty Hearst audio tapes. Extras on the dvd contain the full audio recordings of Patty Hearst as well as the Hibernia Bank robbery tapes and Sacremento Courtroom footage of the recent SLA members who were charged with the death of Myrna Opsahl, who was murdered during a bank robbery. Highly recommended
