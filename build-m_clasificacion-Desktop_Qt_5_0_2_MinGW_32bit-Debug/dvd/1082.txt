 Alan Hale plays the owner of the largest movie theatre in Budapest. He persuades the head of the city's orphanage to allow one the her girls to become an usherette. Hale selects the naive, gregarious Luisa (Sullavan) - who has just crashed to the floor from a chandelier after acting out the story of THE GOOD FAIRY for the younger girls. Hale warns Luisa of the evils of men and the importance of good deeds.....A thoroughly charming excursion into a Hollywood long gone, this little movie still pleases and endears those who like whimsy. Helen Hayes starred in the Broadway version of the play. Sullavan and director William Wyler were in all actuality married when this was filmed: they bickered and clashed throughout production. Originally, the scene with Hale and Sullavan mentioned above was to imply Hale teaching Sullavan the "facts of life". Naturally, 1934 censors deemed this as gravely objectionable, so his advice to Luisa was concerned about her general unworldliness - rather than being sexually green
