 I utilize this tape on those days that aren't scheduled "off" days but on which I really have a hard time gathering the oomph for my usual high intensity workouts. I do break a sweat, but I have dance experience and can embellish moves as needed. In general, I love dance but despise dance workouts, (boring and often annoying), but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate. Further, she breaks the video down into mini-routines, so if you wanted to, you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music, (she provides counts - mostly 8 but some 4 & 16 - throughout the video). The background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs, which is a nice change. Finally, if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements, this workout will be much less effective, so if you haven't danced before and aren't used to posture and breathing, keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles, or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout
