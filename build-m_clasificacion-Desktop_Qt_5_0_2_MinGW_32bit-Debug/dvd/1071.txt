 You'll need them, because you're going to laugh as hard as you cry. I loved the books as a girl, and I adore this movie, and the sequel as well. While no book and movie can ever folloiw one another EXACTLY, it keeps so strongly to the story I almost had to go back to figure out which details they left out. Megan Follows did a terrific job as Anne, and it was a great acting challenge as well, as Anne grows from about the age of 12 to 16-17 in this movie, and Megan Follows was 15 or 16, I believe. Yet her ability carried her through as a very believable 12 year old. The rest of the casting was inspired. The characters looked and acted almost exactly like I had always imagined them. Anne is human. She gets mad, she gets hurt, she acts or speaks before she thinks, and this makes her believable to any child, or any one of us who's ever done something like that. Welll worth owning, and showing to anyone who'll watch.
