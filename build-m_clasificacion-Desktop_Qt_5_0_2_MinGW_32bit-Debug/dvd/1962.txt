 A surprise hit that was nominated for Best Picture in 1994, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is a marvelously performed romantic comedy. Hugh Grant is superb as Charlie, the suave young man who is always late for weddings, and is looking for the right girl to speak his own vows. Andie McDowell is the American who enters Charlie's life, but his refusal to make a commitment sends her into the hands of a much older man (Corin Redgrave). What makes this movie so delightful is its marvelous supporting cast: Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah, James Fleet, and of course the sublime Kristin Scott Thomas as the acid-tongued but charming Fiona. Rowan Atkinson also has a scene-stealing hilarious moment as a nervous priest really screwing up the wedding ceremony at Wedding # 2. The movie is incredibly human and Hannah's recitation of a W.H. Auden poem at the funeral is extremely powerful. For romantic comedies, they don't get much better than this. Another high point: the guitar strumming couple who warble both CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU and STAND BY YOUR MAN. A Fun film
