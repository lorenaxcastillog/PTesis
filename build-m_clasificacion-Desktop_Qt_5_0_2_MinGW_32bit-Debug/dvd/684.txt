 This film is light and fun, well acted and knows what it is. A film that doesn't take itself seriously yet does present a convincing love story in a beautiful setting with a fun take on an historical figure. And I might only give it 4 stars, but it gets the extra star for showcasing the beauty of... New Jersey. My home state gets a bad rap, and this film shows just how lovely much of the state truly is. While it's meant to take place in the 50s, the scenery is still there and still beautiful. Oh, and one other thing that makes it a five... As a man, this is one of those "chick films" that I'll gladly watch with my girlfriend. It's Meg Ryan at her cutest, and Tim Robbins is weird enough looking that I look pretty good in comparison. This movie helps perpetuate the myth that goofy looking guys without much to offer can attract smart, attractive women, and hey, what's wrong with that? ;
