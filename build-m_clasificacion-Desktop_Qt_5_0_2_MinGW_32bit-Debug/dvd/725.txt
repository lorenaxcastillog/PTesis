 I purchased this workout DVD on the recommendation of my sister. She was right on when she told me it was a good workout. I sweat big time and yet find it uncomplicated and easy to follow. I am not the most coordinated person in the world so doing lots of fancy combos on aerobic workouts doesn't work for me. This was straightforward, got my heart rate up, and as I said, I sweat. The only thing I wish they would improve is the music. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. Its practically non-existent and mostly you just hear Bob talking. I like Bob, he's goofy, but I really like music when I work out. So I just turn down the sound on my TV and put on my own music mix sometimes. Oh, the other thing I like about this video is that they are real people exercising and they haven't all reached their goal weight. They struggle with the workout just like me
