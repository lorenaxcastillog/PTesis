 There's little to say about this movie, since I assume that people interested in buying this item have already seen it already. But the amount and quality of extras that this DVD has is just breathtaking. To say the least, Disc 2 has the IMAX version of the film, which at the time of this writing is not documented here in Amazon. The IMAX version is, well :), a shorter version of the film (1h55' versus the 2h20' of the regular) in an aspect ratio of 1:66. So if you were unsure as to buy the Widescreen or FullScreen versions, I suggest buying the Wide, since you will get (sort of) a full screen version in the IMAX one present on Disc 2. Then there is this documentary "The conquest of space" which is rather dull, "The astronauts story" a very short but interesting clip, the excellent "making of" and the juicy commentary by Jim Lovell, pinpointing hits and misses of the film compared to the real thing. At $9.90, how can you NOT buy this jewel
