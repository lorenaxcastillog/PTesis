 I had my doubts about this film when it came out and now that I've finally seen it I know why: It's manipulative and unrealistic. Penn does a decent job playing Sam, the mentally handicapped single-father. Pfeiffer's not bad as his high-priced, high-strung lawyer. But neither can save the script from its pitfalls, namely, an unrealistic portrayal of a grown man with the mind of a seven year old. None of the characters come of seeming like real people so much as types. Even his daughter (the annoying Fanning) is more HOllywood precociousness about her than real-life childlike qualities. More time seems to have been spent on product placement that developing the story and characters. The saving grace is the slight ambiguity of the ending; I thought for sure they'd settle for the cheap, easy ending just as they settled for the cheap and easy everywhere else in the film
