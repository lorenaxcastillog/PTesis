 I have been as die-hard a red sox fan as they come the past 30yrs of my life. I love the Sox, the ups and downs of rooting for them, and New England. I hate this DVD. For 90 minutes the viewer must endure watching a number of barely distinguishable Red Sox fans follow the team during the 2003 season. Most of these people annoyed the hell out of me. It's unbearable. I don't want to watch a bunch of whiny, overly self-involved jerks on my TV. I also thought there would be some insight/interviews of players. There was nothing worth mentioning really . Every once in a while there's an annoying shot of Kevin Millar acting like a 'tard or talking about something that makes no sence. In fact, there are more scenes in this film that have no point of reference, or capture dialogue in the middle of a sentence that I never knew what the hell anyone was talking about. It's like a bad film school project. It blows. I sat down all excited to watch this thing after they won the W.S. this year and I all I got was one big bum-out
