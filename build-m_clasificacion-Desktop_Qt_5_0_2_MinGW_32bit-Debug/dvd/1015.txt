 This is yet one more brilliant film in the Lynch universe. I've loved everything he's done (even Twin Peaks: Firewalk With Me), and he seems to get better with each film. This film was originally a TV pilot (!), but it was rejected by ABC as "too weird". That really isn't too surprising. So David got additional funds, and made into one of his best films. I don't want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film. All I know is that it did occur, and I felt it, whatever it was. That's good enough for me and the rest of the world. Even Roger Ebert liked this film, even though I think it was because the majority of critics adored it, and Ebert didn't want to be in constrast to the crowd (Ebert has always been hostile to Lynch's work). The performances are superb all around, with kudos going to Justin Theroux as "the director", who has a great scene with studio heads about "the girl". Love the golf club! I'm looking forward to Inland Empire, a 3 hour helping from Mr. Lynch. Lovely.
