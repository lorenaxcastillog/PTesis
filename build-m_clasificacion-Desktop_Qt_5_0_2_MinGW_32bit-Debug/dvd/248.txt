 Some classic episodes indeed. All In The Family broke new ground in television sitcoms. The world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households. Archie Bunker's old fashioned values were being challenged. It is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced Archie Bunker's views were. Organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood? Not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion? Quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone. Certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970's. Carol O'Connor, Jean Stapelton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times. All In The Family spawned off may other great shows such as The Jeffersons, Maude, and indirectly Good Times. This first season was certainly a reverred one. Just look at it with an open mind
