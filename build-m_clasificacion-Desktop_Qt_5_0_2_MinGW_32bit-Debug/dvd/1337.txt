 This DVD brought back so many of the emotions that I felt the morning of September 11, 2001. I never want to forget the way I felt that morning and the months and years that have followed. Why would I?! If I were to forget, that would be, in essence, forgetting all those who lost their lives that fateful day. This DVD shows footage that I had never seen before (ie: A view of the second plane hitting one of the towers) and it shows footage that I had wanted to forget (close-up shots of people falling from the buildings). Warning: There ARE some graphic still photographs that caught me totally off guard (broken bodies on the ground). I was NOT, in any way, prepared for that. I broke into sobs. However, I would never take back watching this wonderful documentary. It has re-awakened my appreciation for the hero's of that day and my sympathies to those who lost their lives and for those who lost their loved one(s)
