 I'm a big Kevin Spacey, 'the actor' fan. He plays his role in this movie very well as he does with all of them. Helen Hunt also plays her part very well, and the young man(Name??-he was the kid in The Sixth Sense) is very talented and is the focal point of the entire show and does an excellent job. It's a movie that makes you feel good at worst. Don't pay it back, pay it forward in goodness. A great 'golf caddy' and human being who is no longer with us named Harvey Penick wrote: "Never talk bad about anyone, it only stirs resentment. Speak no ill of anyone and all the good you know of everybody. And remember, never judge a person too soon. God waits until the end". A very humble man who 'walked the walk'. If we could all live that kind of life everyday wouldn't it be a wonderful world. Buy it. It's a keeper. Adults and kids both.
