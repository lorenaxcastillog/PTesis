 If every movie were perfect, if every script were flawless, if every actor were Humphrey Bogart and every actress were Lauren Becal, if every director were John Huston then what fun would there be on Oscar night? I am a `B' movie fan and this is a really fine example of a `B' detective movie. Plenty of action, plenty of beautiful scenery and people, a halfway decent plot, plenty of logical unpredictability, and it plays well on the small screen. It has more grit than "The Big Easy" and a fairly good cast. And it has an honesty that saves us from suffering through an ending with a dime store moral. This is a good one for one of those evening when you have nothing else to do and no one special to do it with. So warm up the VCR/DVD, pop up a big bowl, dump on the butter and salt, pop the top on a cool one and enjoy.
