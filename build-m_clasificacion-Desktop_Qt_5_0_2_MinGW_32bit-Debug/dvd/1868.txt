 Until now, I have never owned a Gilad aerobic dvd of any kind. I always thought I'd prefer a dvd by someone not so extremely buff looking, but decided to give it a try out of the blue. I'm really happy with this workout (even though it's a little old and now days there are better choreographers). He's outgoing without being over the top and he's a good instructor. He keeps the routine fresh by changing the steps often, but it's not too hard that you won't be able to keep up. The choreography isn't too complex. There is the usual pivots, knee lifts and taps etc so if you are already an experienced stepper, you'll have this down in no time. His setting here is stunning - Waikiki. That in itself is motivating. Based on this particular dvd, I'm quite prepared to purchase and try other Gilad workouts because he's really good and knows what he's doing and makes the workout interesting. I highly recommend this one
