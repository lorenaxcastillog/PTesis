 At first, I couldn't get into believing the character of Scarlett. My problem with her was her brown eyes. This may not sound like it should be a problem, but if you're a fan of the novels you know that there is much emphasis on the beauty of her green eyes. This was very important to me, as I'm sure it is to others. Why they couldn't give the actress a pair of colored lenses is beyond my understanding. There is simply no comparasion to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, to try and do so would be impossible. If you watch the movie without trying to compare everything to GWTW, you might just enjoy yourself. Overlooking the fact that this actress has brown eyes, I did soon come to like and enjoy these two actors and believed them to be Rhett and Scarlett. It was a good bit of fun, and I believe it is worth the money to add this DVD to your collection.
