 I started Deadwood out of the addiction I recently acquired for "The Wire," and it easily filled the gap. Deadwood is by far one of the greatest TV series ever and to have finished season 3 only to learn they have planned on cancelling the show is a real disappointment. I don't know if it will help, but if you share my feelings, maybe voicing your opinions will help on the HBO website: [...] After learning that there will be no season 4 has made me wish I had not watched Season 3, because there was no closure. Season 2 at least had some formulation of closure. This series is definitley worth the buy. There aren't too many tv series that I would watch twice, but this is one of them. I really hope they reconsider and decide to keep this series going. If you watch this show, you will be drawn in like a moth to a flame, only to burn in the end of a such a wonderful work of creativity.
