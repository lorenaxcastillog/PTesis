 I'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because Debbie Harry is in it. It is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers' discretion. Is Debbie Harry real or is she just another "Videodrome" hallucination? I definately wouldn't say this is a "fun" movie either...after watching it I felt dirty and sleazy, like I needed to take a long hot shower. Anyway, since this is the big fancy "Criterion Collection" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version
