 Crash is a wonderful film that should be watched by anyone mature enough to watch it. Its just an amazing story on film with an all out great cast including Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, and Terrence Howard who all gave professionally stellar performances. Crash tells a story of L.A. and the people living everyday in the beautiful city trying to cope with elements like racism, sadism, friendship, and deep love. The title of the film explains it well, the fact that by the end all the characters become interwined and their lives end up crashing into each other as a result. An emotionally beautiful film not only to be entertained but for people to learn something of life as well. To me this deserved to get best picture and not Brokeback Mountain, where some people believe it should not have. Paul Haggis is a genius for creating a nice, work of art movie such as Crash
