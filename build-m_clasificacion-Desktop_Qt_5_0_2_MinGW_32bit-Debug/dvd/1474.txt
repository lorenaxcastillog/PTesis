 Don't get me wrong. I love Bill Murray and I'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he's deserved. But these Wes Anderson "comedies" are just lame. RUSHMORE started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out. THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story (it felt like two-hours even if it wasn't). And now THE LIFE AQUATIC. All of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts. I don't think there's been a good comedy since A FISH CALLED WANDA in 1988 (although parts of THE BIG LEBOWSKI are hilarious) so I don't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies. Most stink. Maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy. That might explain the glowing reviews here. Although Anderson's films are competently made, they feel stuffy and pretentious. Humorless. I chuckled once per hour. Not a good average. I don't think this movie ever makes up its mind. And I'm so sick of Owen Wilson that I wish Hollywood would give him a paid vacation. Does he have to be in every single movie ever made
