 After the superb masterpiece Pulp Fiction, came From Dusk Till Dawn (1995) which continued the genius Quentin Tarantinos consistent flair for startling origanality and diversity. This wild action-thriller sees two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) venturing on a desperate crime spree across America. Tarantino puts in an effective and significantly amusing performance as the completely deranged convict who alongside the dynamic on-screen presence of George Clooney, kidnaps a preacher (played convincingly by Harvey Kietel of Reservoir Dogs fame) and his two children (which includes Juliette Lewis of Natural Born Killers fame). They flee with their hostages in tow to a remote and eerie nightclub in Mexico. Where as the film seems to be settling down as a compelling hostage drama, the film wildly steers direction and plunges into an enduring and darkly humorous horror movie as the nightclub is soon to be discovered to be crawling with blood-thirsty vampires. The outrageous plot twists shrewdly make From Dusk Till Dawn all the more compelling and riveting and the dialogue races along like a rollercoaster! The special effects are vastly impressive and the energetic filmmaking and engaging peformances from all the cast makes this truly another masterpiece to Tarantinos credit.
