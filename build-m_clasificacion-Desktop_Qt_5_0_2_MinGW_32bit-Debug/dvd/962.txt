 From the opening with the instruction rather than appeal - This Movie should be played LOUD. The movie starts and takes through a veritable rock fest - the greatest are here on stage. Highs - Joni Mitchell - Fantastic - Lows Paul Butterfield. The whole range in between - Eric Clapton give a journetman's performance, Van the Man, rocks like never before - and he dosen't forget his lyrics. One of my colleagues - when we saw the movie in a Cinema - years ago decided that the movie was fantastic except for "the weird dude in the white hat singing the dylan songs". Who was it - Dylan - not his best but still rocks. The final scene with everyone on stage - watch for Neil young's hand as it slips behind Joni Mitchell's behind - I'd give my right arm..... Get yourself a great Dolby 5.1 system - fire up your 50 inch LCD TV or PDP - let rock rock.
