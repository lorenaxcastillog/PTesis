 Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie! It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action. The characters are wonderful. Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players. The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well. What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them! The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review. If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind). I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry. Loved it! Favorite line: "I hate you, you... bastard people... You're all bastard people!
