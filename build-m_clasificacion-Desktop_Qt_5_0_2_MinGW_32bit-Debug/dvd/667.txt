 The training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well. I just don't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training. It is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks. It doesn't train you how to house train a puppy. It also doesn't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd. The dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips. Luckily you can skip these. I personally would not recommend this, but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning technique.Something else I did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals. I was able to teach my blue healer pup (Abby) to sit, lay down, come and heel in about 3 tries each. I liked the techniques, but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd.
