 Well, I'd agree with tweedle that the "fan service" pencil cards are over the top, but only because they are inconsistent with the characters in the series. The series is very good in character development, with lots of good back story early on. The only "fan service" episode is "Heart of Darkness", which shows a bare chested woman, but she's not one of the main characters. It doesn't seem very provocative to me, since there's no emphasis on sex, the character is only trying to keep her clothes dry. Still, this feels like a "filler" episode, and doesn't really contribute to the story. The plot is inconsistent between seasons. In Heart of Darkness, the girls search for an ancient key for the books, but in episode 14 (the set up for the second season), we find that the books are not ancient... I like the art in this series, It has a hand drawn feel to it, lots of attention to detail. I'd definitely buy it again
