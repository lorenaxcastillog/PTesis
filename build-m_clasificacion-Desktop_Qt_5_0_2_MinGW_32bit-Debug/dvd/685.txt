 This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy. The cast is great. Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) the Garage Mechanic falls in love at first sight of Catherine(Meg Ryan) when she appears at his Gas Station with a failing car with her pretentious fiance James Mooreland (Stephen Fry). Ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door. The door opens and there is Albert Einstein(Walter Matthau) "You're Albert Einstien!" "Zank you" and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring Ed and Catherine together. The subcharacters are great! Especially Einstein's pals played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher. "Three of the greatest minds and together they can't change a light bulb." All in all a great warm funny film! Matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant. He should have been nominated IMHO. You can't go wrong with this one
