 This is a beautiful celebration of a beautiful man. If you missed the film in theatres and have even the slightest interest in seeing it or in Leonard Cohen, you won't be disappointed. It delivers beyond expectations. The DVD also includes Rufus Wainwright's tender and powerful version of "Hallelujah" -- a glaring omission on the CD and a definite highlight of the film. The four bonus performances not in the film are: "Tower of Song" - Martha Wainwright "Bird on A Wire" -- Perla Batalla "Famous Blue Raincoat" -- The Handsome Family "Tonight Will Be Fine" -- Teddy Thompson The "Conversation with Leonard Cohen" feature is good, but so short it's just a tease. There is much poetry and courage in this film. Both the narrative and the performances are affirmations of life and humanity...done with great talent, humor, depth, craftsmanship, warts and all. Leonard Cohen has a lot to say. In more ways than one, "I'm Your Man" adheres to and gives life to his musical and poetic vision
