 RV is a comedy that brings to the screen the story of a company executive caught between his job and his family, who decides to rent an RV to take the family on vacation while at the same time trying hard to stay on top of things with regards to his job responsibilities. Could he be possibly biting more than he can chew? There are the slightest hints of the 1980's classic Vacation starring Chevy Chase... Robin Williams, Cheryl Hines and Kristin Chenoweth (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS), and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! In short, RV is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4 1/2 Stars
