 DON'T BE FOOLED!!!! The page states that David Lynch directed this, but he actually took his name off (look at the screen shot). This extended edition was directed by Alan Smithee. Don't worry though . . . it gets worse. I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case, so here it goes. First off, I loved the books and David Lynch's interpretation in the theatrical release. That being said, this is just aweful. I totally agree with those who have stated that this is an abomination. Cons include, but are not limited to: Good scenes cut from the theatrical Bad voice over with storyboards for much of the 'extra footage' Uneven quality and clumsy transitions to new material The list goes on. Do yourself a favor and don't spend the money on this. Just get the theatrical release and be happy. If you didn't like David Lynch's interpretation, then just take the time and pleasure to read the book again. I can't believe they actually released this. I totally understand David Lynch taking his name off of this. -Sincerely, -
