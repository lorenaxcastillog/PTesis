 How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying is one of my favorite musicals from the 1960s (none of which I like as much as the best musicals of the '40s & '50s, like "Singin' In The Rain," etc.). It follows the rapid advance of a window washer (Robert Morse) in the corporate world, exploring every way to get ahead except for hard work: Sucking up, stealing credit, shifting blame; it's all here, with a measure of cynical humor worthy of The Simpsons. As Morse works his way up from the mail room to VP of Advertising, he falls in love with secretary Rosemary (Michele Lee). Rudy Vallee, rarely seen in the movies, has a major role as the president of the World Wide Wicket company. There are several good songs, mostly with humorous lines in clever rhyming schemes, including "The Company Way," "Been A Long Day," "Rosemary," and the redeeming "Brotherhood of Man." Morse is outstanding in the lead role. Michael J. Fox played a similar character in "The Secret Of My Success" a couple decades later
