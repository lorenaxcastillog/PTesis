 Every time I watch this movie, its just as exciting as the last. With a Killer soundtrack, great actors and even better settings, this movie is one you don't want to miss. Nicholas Cage plays Michael, a man who is making his way back to Texas when he stops at a local bar for a cup of coffee. There, he is mistaken for "Lyle from Texas," and instead of denying this identity, he runs with it. What happens is the result of a well made movie. As I said before, the music is absolutly killer, and its just too bad that they never released it CD. However, this coupled with the eery locations on which the film was shot gives the movie depths that it might not have achieved otherwise. One of Nicholas Cage's better movies, and a performence you won't want to miss. What can I say? Its the perfect modern day western thriller! :
