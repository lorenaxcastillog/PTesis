 Dick Van Dyke brigns to life Caracticous Pott, an inventer whose inventions never seem to work out the way he wants. One thing I didn't realize for the longest time was the play on words in the creation of name. Take Caracticous Pott. He's a 'Crack-Pot' inventor. The songs are great. I can listen to Hushabye Mountain and Ol Bamboo a hundred times. But let's not forget the title song "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". A catchy tune that the kids will bug you with for weeks. After I got this DVD and the kids had watched it for awhile, everytime we got in the car they would sing it. Cute at first but wore on the ears after the first dozen times. The stroyline is sound, basically a fairytale told at the beach. If you are ever to watch this, you need to watch the dvd or vhs. Don't waste your time with regular tv, they cut way too much out. Excellent all way around. Dick Van Dyke is one of my favorite actors of all time who rarely lets you down
