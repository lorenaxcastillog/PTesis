 If you think you can't handle another minute of Elmo, perhaps it's time to introduce your kids to The Muppet Show collection. Even if you didn't watch the show as a youngster, you will probably appreciate the show's roster of guest stars, including Candice Bergen, Sandy Duncan, Florence Henderson, and other luminaries you may have forgotten--not to mention the show's smart, funny, and child-appropriate variety show sketches. Above all, it will remind you of Sesame Street's best years--before it was dumbed down by that irritating red character who refers to himself in the third person. (What IS that about anyway?) The Muppet Show Collection features Kermit and other beloved characters--plus the indomitable Miss Piggy! I recently showed the a couple of episides to my three year-old daughter and she thought Miss P was hilarious--and what child would wouldn't? She was a cultural icon! A great gift that seems a more worthwhile than most of the newer kid's shows on dvd
