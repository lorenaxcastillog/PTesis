 There were many corny scenes in this movie and also things that didn't jive with the real Arthur story.. but so what? Its just a kids movie. Even though it's corny(obviously trying to be) it is fun and full of action. We are learning about the middle ages in homeschool and this was the only movie I could find on the period suitable for a 2nd grader. (Except educational ones at the library) We are learning all the factual information and the authentic Arthur story from library books and this was just for fun and to make it more visual. Now he knows what a tournament would look like and how knights would dress as well as what a castle might look like in real life instead of on a page. I think this movie is just for fun and not for grown adults who want a more realistic Arthur movie. There are very few "corny" movies out there I would bother to watch but I actually enjoyed this one. ;
