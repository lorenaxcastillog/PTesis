 We started off with "Right Brain" on this series. After a few days we introduced my daughter (20 months) to Shapes and Color DVD. We must admit, this is an awesome DVD. Even better than the Right Brain! The narrator describes each shapes and colors very clearly and distinctly. My daughter after watching it for few days can now say red green blue (in her own pronounciation ofcourse) ! I would highly recommend this DVD. Along with this, you may also look into getting bright colored balls and objects. We bought five very bright colored foam balls from Walmart which also proved to be very valuable. Now she can relate to things shown in the DVD and things around her. Also there is a song in the DVD "I am sitting on green grass" which we thought was sooo peaceful and catchy that me and my wife are always humming it. :-
