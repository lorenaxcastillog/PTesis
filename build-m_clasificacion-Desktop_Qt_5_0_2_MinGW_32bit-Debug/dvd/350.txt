 Tightly constructed plots and likeable characters make CSI Miami my favorite of the CSI franchises. The series did not quite reach its peak until the second season, but season one is still high-quality entertainment. There is an occasional bad episode with plot holes and protagonists acting out of character, but CSI Miami is still easily one of the best crime dramas out there. Even people who do not like CSI often like CSI Miami. Those who get annoyed by the wisecracking cops, bizarre storylines, and techno-wizardry of CSI might find CSI Miami to their liking. The spinoff is more about developing the main characters and telling a fast-paced story where every plot element is resolved. If you can forgive a weak episode here and there, one too many buildings that blow up the second after Horatio runs out of them, and the fact that the writers had obviously not yet worked out all the details in season one, then check out this DVD set. I received it from my brother-in-law for Christmas and watched the whole series in a couple of weeks. Extras include several documentaries on the making of the show that will interest die-hard fans like myself
