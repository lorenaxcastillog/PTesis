 This DVD is one of about 10 that I use to work out on a daily basis. This video is by far my favorite. I feel like it never gets old and Tamilee keeps me motivated without annoying me. She gives ideas to increase or decrease the exercise depending on if you are just starting out or if you have been doing the video for a while. Unlike one of the other reviewers I actually think that she warms you up quickly and moves right into the exercises which I like. Especially if you are doing one or more workout I dont like having a long warm up for each exercise. Tamilee doesn't do that. After each workout I can feel that my muscles have been worked without being in pain or unable to work out again the next day. I think this is one of the BEST workout videos you can buy.
