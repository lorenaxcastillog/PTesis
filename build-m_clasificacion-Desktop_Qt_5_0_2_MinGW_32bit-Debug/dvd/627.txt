 Its 2005 and only recently have I managed to catch the Torch Song Trilogy that was made in 1988. But since 1988, many gay oriented theme movies have popped up ranging from going through AIDs(Philadelphia) plus a more positive approach towards coming of age story (from Edge of Seventeen to Get Real to Beautiful Thing). Not to mention the French coming out with really raunchy coming out gay pieces like Wild Reeds and Come Undone. Thus, when I decided to watch this 1988 movie(due to boredom), I was a bit more reserved and wasn't expecting so much from the outcome due to the fact that there has been many movies since its time. Alas, after watching it for almost 2 hours, I have to admit - IT was GOOD! I could not say that it was good for its time back in 88 since I was eight back then. But now after watching so many gay movies, this is one good piece of writing and film adaptation! Superb I am sure if you wish to know more about the greatness of the movie the other reviewers will have much to say. A must watch
