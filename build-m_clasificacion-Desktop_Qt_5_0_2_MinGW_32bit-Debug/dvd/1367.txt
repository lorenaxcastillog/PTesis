 'The Keys of the Kingdom' released in '44 is one of the great film classics from the "Golden Age" of Hollywood. This is a deeply spiritual and wonderfully inspiring movie that you're sure to respond emotionally to, so be sure to have a full box of kleenex on hand. Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect in the starring role as Father Chisum, a humble, devote but highly unorthodox Catholic priest who can't seem to to anything right until he finally finds his calling in remote China. It is his honest nature and authentic love for the Chinese, not empty sermonizing, that little by little earns the love and trust of the community. 'The Keys of the Kingdom' won the Academy Award for "Best Picture" in '45 and it's easy to see why. Director John M. Stahl's masterpiece contains some of the most expertly crafted black and white cinematorgrahy you'll ever see. Every landscape, every angle is a visual portrait of exquiste beauty. Also boasting a stellar cast of stars and a marvelous script, you'll certainly want to add this film to your DVD collection
