 Everyone - do yourselves a favor and immediately purchase Seasons 1 and 2 of Carnivale. This is one of the few chances in life to see true genius in writing, directing and acting. If I ran HBO, or had the money to do it myself, I would bring all the cast & crew together to do several more seasons. At the very least, I would create a feature film to try to finish the story. Yes, the fight between light and dark can never be "finished", but it was a travesty that HBO ended this series when it did instead of allowing one more season to bring things to some sort of conclusion. I would imagine that everyone connected to the creation of this show is richer for having been involved with it, as are the viewers who devoured every episode. It will make you think, it will make you dream and it will make you wish more episodes would be created. Kudos to all the talented people involved, and boy, do we miss all of you
