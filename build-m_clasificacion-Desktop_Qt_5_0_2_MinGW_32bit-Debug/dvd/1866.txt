 As someone who loves original broadcast footage of sporting events from the 1970's, it was with great aanticipation that I have waited for the 1979 World Series DVD collection. The 1979 World Series was a 7 game classic between two of the most succesful franchises of the 70's. Seeing the original ABC broadcast of these games with DVD quality is a real treat and brings back a lot of memories, even for a Cubs fan. The only negatives would be the following minor issues: 1.For some reason, the quality of Game 5 is not the best, particularly the last 5 innings. 2.Games 2,3, and 4 do not have most of the graphics from the original ABC broadcast. Overall, it is very enjoyable to watch each game and the extras (including the 9th inning of Game 3 of the NLCS) and I would highly recommend it. I'm now looking forward to the 1975 Red Sox-Reds World Series Release. John
