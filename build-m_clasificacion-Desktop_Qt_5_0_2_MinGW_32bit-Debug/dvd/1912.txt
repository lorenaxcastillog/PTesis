 I love Madonna!!!!! But.... I purchased the original VHS version back when it first came out. Now the DVD version, and reproduction quality is really poor! The videos are blurry -- its as if they lost the original (or was not able to obtain it) and used a copy and made a new one from it. For example, In the video "Pappa Don't Preach", in some of the "low light" parts, you cant even make out their faces - total silhouette... not so on the VHS version. But I did get a BIG SURPRISE on the DVD that was not on the VHS version and that was Madonna had (2) wardrobe malfunctions in her dance sequences in the "Pappa Don't Preach" video, - two total breast with full nipple exposure on both!!! This was edited out on the VHS version. Sorry Miss Jackson...Looks like Madonna did it first again! Overall, most of the videos on the DVD were not as crisp and clear as the original VHS version
