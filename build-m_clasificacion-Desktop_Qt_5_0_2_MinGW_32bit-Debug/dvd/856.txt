 The first thing that I liked most about the dvd was the instructor. She was positive but not too annoying, as many instructors on workout dvd's are. The dvd is split up into sections: a warm up, standing ab cardio, ab floor workout, and a cool down. The standing portion of the dvd was so so. It did get my heart rate up and have me sweating but I really didn't feel my abs burning at any point. I did feel my legs burning though. The floor portion of the dvd was very good. The instructor has you doing lots of different styles of crunches that have your abs shaking and screaming for it to be over. The next day I was very sore. All in all I think that the dvd was a good buy and it did a good job on the cardio and the ab portion on the floor. I don't regret the purchase
