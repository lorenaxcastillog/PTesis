 Like others writing on this site, I fondly recall gasping for air and rolling on the floor for the original Fractured Flickers; would tell anyone who'd listen to me that it was the funniest show ever on TV; and searched for years to find it on VHS, DVD, etc -- no luck. I even emailed Jay Ward Productions and asked about it, repeatedly, each time getting a generic "thanks for being such a great fan" answer, until finally one of the responses mentioned something about lawyers. I figured that was it, until a few weeks ago I idly Googled FF and up came the complete collection collection on DVD at Amazon! I plunked down my $$, waited breathlessly, got the package, waited for the right Fung Shui, and -- with the charged anticipation of other reviewers -- popped it in the DVD player with trembling hands. Forty-two years after I'd last seen it. And laughed like a maniac all over again. Note to fellow Boomers -- it helps to have some of your favorite intoxicant on board..
