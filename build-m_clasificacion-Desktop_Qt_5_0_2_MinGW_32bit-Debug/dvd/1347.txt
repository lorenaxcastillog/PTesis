 I don't get a chance to watch CSI:NY when it's on TV during the week, but since I love the original CSI so much I thought I'd give it a shot and watch the DVD set. It's really well done with good story lines and well developed characters. I could've done without the first episode (the one after the crossover show with CSI:Miami) only because it seemed to try too hard to be dark and disturbing. As the season progressed, though, the stories got better and they lightened up on making NY so depressing. The original CSI is still the best, but this franchise is a really good addition. If they add another show (and hopefully get rid of CSI:Miami) maybe they could go with somewhere unexpected. NY was an obvious choice. It's a big country, how about picking a city that's not featured in every other show on TV? But I digress, this DVD set is very entertaining and worth owning
