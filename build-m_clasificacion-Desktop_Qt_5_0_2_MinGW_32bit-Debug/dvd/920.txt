 The care and attention given to character and relationship development in seasons 1-3 are gone from 4-5. Silly plots, many based on 1980s trends, i.e.: divorce rates, bored housewives in rebellion, aerobics, consumerism made my eyes roll. The suburban episode was the worst-the first Asian characters on the series were Japanese tourists with big cameras and lo and behold, latent martial arts skills that came in handy at the end. It's like season 4 was all about being campy, and I missed the good writing. It was such a different direction for the show than in previous seasons. The romance element is inexplicably headed backwards- the character of Laura Holt has practically become an ice queen and Remington is left to make cheesy passes and be happy with a goodnight kiss. What was up with Laura-abuse in the last Season 4 episode? Meanwhile, the writers seemed to turn their interest towards beautifying Mildred who has had a fashion transformation. She also delivers one-liners every time she opens her mouth. I agree that the airline and butler episodes were better.
