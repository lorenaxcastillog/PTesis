 I wanted to like Block Party. I dig Chappelle's comedy, I like most of the musical line up, and have read lots of great reviews of this film; so, I expected to enjoy this movie more than I did (anticipating maybe 20-30 total minutes of Chappelle doing new stand up material between the music sets). I found the Block Party's paucity of its host's performance disappointing. Given, it's called "Block Party," but it's still reasonable to assume that the "Dave Chappelle's" part indicates that Dave will actually give a performance during it. Maybe "Dave Chappelle hosts a block party featuring mostly other performers" would be a more apt title. The musical guests gave great performances -- those watching mostly for the music aren't likely to be disappointed. Those watching for the comedy, however: be prepared for a lot of music and a few human interest clips with locals in Dave's Ohio town and at a Brooklyn daycare -- not Dave performing any new stand up material or skits. The great reviews this film got in most media aren't for new Chappelle comedy material, rather for the movie's concept, message, and music.
