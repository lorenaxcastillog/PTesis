 Season 1 and 2 of Chapelle's Show are amazing, and it is a shame that we no longer have his very witty, very intelligent truth-telling regularly on air. Dave Chapelle is a brilliant satirist, who isn't continuing his show mostly because so many people can't -- or don't want to -- understand what he is saying. His skits explore the hypocrisy inherent in American society, especially concerning race. However, he is equally critical of both black and white. More than anything, he is usually commenting on people who say one thing when they mean another, people who insist on being oblivious to the wrongs around them, and likewise, the people who blame their misfortune on racism when it is usually the result of their own shortcomings. He also mocks the attention given to many of our celebrities and mocks celebrity culture in general, often bringing on the celebrities themselves to participate in his commentary (Skits with Rick James and Wayne Brady are but a few). He is brilliant. These DVDs are terrific, and he will be missed
