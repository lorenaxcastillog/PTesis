 The Bee Gees as always put on an excellent concert. They sound great live as they do on any album. This concert was more touching since the recent passing of maurice gibb and the way he interacts with the audience and fans who call in. So, there are some funny moments with him and the rest of the Bee Gees. I would recommend everybody watch this concert. My family also watched and loved it. You will not be disappointed. I love it when Barry sings &quot;How can you mend a broken heart.&quot; Robin's &quot;Massachutettes&quot; and &quot;I started a joke&quot; which he sings the same way as he did when it was first recorded. Maurice's &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; I love all his songs from their &quot;This is where I came in&quot; album. They sing 5 of their songs from this album which are great. My personal favorite &quot;Jive Talkin&quot; I plan to buy more of their concerts which I plan to do reviews on. All the Best! Happy Viewing! Angel
