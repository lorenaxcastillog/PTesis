 Even though I wasn't a part of the early 90s grunge scene, I can really relate to the theme in this movie, a theme that explores the ups and downs of the single life. As a matter of fact, I believe that anyone who has ever been single can relate to what's shown in the movie. For example, how many of us have gotten involved with someone we think is &quot;The One&quot;, only to find out that he/she is a jerk? How many of us have pined away for a boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to notice that we exist? How many of us have gone to great lengths to find Mr. or Ms. Right? And how many of us have been hesitant to get into another relationship because we've been burned by previous ones? Answer: most of us. The above-mentioned scenarios are ones that we see not only in the movie, but also in our real lives. And as a previous reviewer mentioned, the movie takes place in the Northwest, but it could happen anywhere
