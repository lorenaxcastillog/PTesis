 The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.I feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.I mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies,I personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these movies.Weather their good or bad.Because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.Even if it's just a movie.And, last,but not least the remarkable thing i like about this series so much is when a important person dies,that they can be given a 2nd chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightful deed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or themselves.I BELIEVE IT'S A ACT OF FAITH..
