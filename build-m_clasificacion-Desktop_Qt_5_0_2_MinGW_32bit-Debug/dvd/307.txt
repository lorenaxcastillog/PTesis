 This was the season when the A-Team was the highest rated television. This comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Shultz, and Dirk Benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television. This season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes, some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of Stephen J. Cannell. The Big Squeeze, and Incident at Crystal Late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich such as Bullets and Bikinis, and Timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun. This season was before the Cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive, and the formula was in full force. So if you like to watch elaborate con jobs or even the worst (or best shots) in the cinema pick up this season
