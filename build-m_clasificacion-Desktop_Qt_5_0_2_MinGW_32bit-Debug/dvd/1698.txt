 For some reasons that I do not understand myself, I watched this 89 movie only now, although I have liked several other Weir movies a lot,like Master and Commander, the Witness, the Mosquito Coast. Strange things happen. Now my 16 year old daughter convinced me to watch it with her, and it was fully worth it. After skimming some of the other reviews here, I realize I have nothing much to add in terms of praise (inspiring, moving, funny, sad ...). It is all true. Does anyone know why only Ethan Hawke among the boys seems to have made it as an adult actor? At least I am not aware that any other of them made a major name later. I think the story, while set in 59 and filmed in 89, is still fully current. With some slight changes in the surface, this could be told today just as convincingly
