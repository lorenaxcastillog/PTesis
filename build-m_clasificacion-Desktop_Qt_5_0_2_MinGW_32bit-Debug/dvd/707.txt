 I already own a DVD of Guys and Dolls, but this edition is how it ought to be done; not an extra disc of irrelevancies but a booklet of pics and posters and some "making of" tie-ins. Those are the sort of touches that befit and enhance a collector's edition of a widescreen film. Also, unlike the double disc Criterion Collection, this keeps the set somewhat affordable. If any film ever merited this sort of red carpet treatment, it's Guys and Dolls. There are so many things going for this film and so many reasons to like it, from the stellar cast to Damon Runyon's Big Apple slang to the Broadway play sets to the unforgettable songs. Along with A Hole in the Head it's probably one of Sinatra's best roles. This play is still put on often, but the film's sparkling cast make this the definitive version. All singing, all dancing, all Guys and Dolls.
