 While the enunciation may not be at it's best, it's not the actor's fault. This cast is AMAZING! It combines the talents of broadway, London, and other productions to create the best cast possible. The only problem is that it was not pre-recorded, therefore, sometimes it's hard to make out what they're saying, especially during times like 'The Naming of Cats.' The downside of them singing everything live also, is that there is no soundtrack. I can never decide which cast I like more - Broadway or London. London has the most beautiful and haunting Grizabella, Elaine Paige. But Broadway has Ken Page and a few other talented actors. This pro-shot dvd of the show has both Elaine Paige and Ken Page! So it gives you a taste of Broadway and London in one. This dvd may be for someone who knows the lyrics by heart so the choppy enunciation problems won't make you look up the lyrics to all the songs every five minutes. But the costumes, set, and actors are great. This is deffinately a must see for any Cat-ophile.
