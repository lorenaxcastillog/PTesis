 I'm a good friend of Haskell Wexler, and edited his film, "Medium Cool," in 1968. This film came out the year before and was required viewing for all of us -- especially because of the way it made a scripted story look like a documentary. I loved the film back then but hadn't seen it again until last week. I admit I was a bit worried that it would appear dated and irrelevant. Quite the contrary! Given events on and since 9/11, Iraq, Madrid, London, Lebanon -- the West's global struggle against Islam -- this film is more important and relevant today than ever. There is one sequence in particular in which three Arab women disguise themselves as Europeans in order to slip bombs past the French colonial checkpoints and plant them in locations where they will kill the maximum number of Europeans. I won't spoil the extraordinary suspense of this sequence by telling you whether or not they succeed. They are not suicide bombers, but as they place their deadly packages they look around at the people they are about to kill. It is simply one of the best pieces of pure cinema ever
