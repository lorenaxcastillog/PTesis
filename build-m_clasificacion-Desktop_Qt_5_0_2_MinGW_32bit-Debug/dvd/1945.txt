 To this day, this is *still* the best movie I've seen the Rock star in. I share the opinion that the Rock never should have left wrestling, but seeing a remake of an old 1973 classic titled 'Walking Tall' helps me see that the Rock is a decent movie star after all. Walking Tall is a movie that won't make you particularly happy after it's over, or make you think you wasted your time. It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments. The Rock is pretty convincing in his roll but the biggest problem with the film is that it's WAY too short and actually feels rushed during certain spots (like for instance, when the Rock becomes the sheriff- there should have been more build-up here instead of him suddenly "being the sheriff"). I'm not really complaining. I enjoyed the film. Just a very short film, that's all.
