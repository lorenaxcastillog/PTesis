 I missed this last tour and looked forward to seeing it on DVD. What I did see were shot after shot of the crowd. How many did I need to see of the crowd singing along? How many celebrities did I need to see? It was like Paul saying, "See how many people love me." Your an ex-Beatle and the surviving half of the greatest songwriting team in music history, it's okay, we all love you. The three generational family attending and meeting Paul saga was a 10 on the douche chills meter. When I go to a concert I'm looking at the stage not at the people around me. Keep the crowd shots to in-between songs. At various points in this DVD the talking heads say how important the audiences are to the show. This is not a Deadhead crowd. There is no need to average over 20 audeince shots per song (and that's with some songs running only a couple of minutes)!! The The highlight of the DVD is in the Extras. Save your money and buy one of the many other Paul concert DVDs that are out there
