 "Memento" is a masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. Guy Pearce portrays [Leonard Shelby] a former insurance agent who is trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked. Therefore, as a result, the character Leonard Shelby does not have the capability to remember anything within the last 10 minutes. Whenever Leonard has a conversion or reads something, he must write it down, or tape it or he will forget. To do this he resorts to photographing people he meets, and tattooing his body in order for him to remember the most important information which he feels will help him find his wife's killer. The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order. Joe Pantoliano portrays the character [Teddy]. And where Teddy's loyalties lie leave the viewer in suspense. The entire movie is a masterpiece in script-writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch. I highly recommend this movie to all viewers.
