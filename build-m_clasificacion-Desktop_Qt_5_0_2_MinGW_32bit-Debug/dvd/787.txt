 Do you remember the 2000 election? Well, you probably do, and well, if you're looking at this DVD in the first place, and you probably remember feeling angst one way or another about those days post-2000 election night. Well, Greenwald doesn't attempt to spurn those feelings; instead, he shows why decisively on both sides of the aisle (but with an admittedly more anti-Republican focus), the 2000 election was a farcical debacle. This was one of many DVD's to come out after that election, but Greenwald's films have the appreciativeness of speed, accuracy, and quality, which many frankly lack. Critical sources consisting of authors, Florida community leaders, and many other people add their two cents to this film and give even more depth and credibility. Even Danny Glover takes the role of 'conductor' if you will, through at least a bit of the film. Overall though, the film cut to the quick as it needed, and should remind us not what's wrong with our voting system, although it does that plent. But what we can do to make it better, and why the fight for voting rights is an ever eventful fight
