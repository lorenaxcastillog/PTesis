 THIS IS THE ONE! The other DVD collections for seasons 1, 2 & 3 were pretty funny (OK...some of the funniest stuff of all time, especially "Druggachusetts," and "The Chip on the Shoulder Club") but THE FOURTH SEASON WAS WHEN IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. It doesn't get any better than the episode called "Show Me Your Weenis!" The first time I saw this, in 1998 when it first aired, I realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent, over-the-top American comedy. Surreal, sharp, better than any British zaniness, and full of bizarre ideas like "furniture for the blind" that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices; and the all-time greatest, "Wyckyd Scepter," which must be seen to be believed. Bob and Dave, you are SO naked! Better than Monty Python ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SO-CALLED "COMEDY" SERIES I CAN THINK OF. IF YOU GET ONLY ONE OF THE MR. SHOW DVD SETS, GET THIS ONE.
