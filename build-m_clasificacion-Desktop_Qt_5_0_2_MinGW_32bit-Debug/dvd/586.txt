 There's two things about what B&B Have to do. One, They Have to find there stolen TV And Tow, There going to Washington to score a chick! Don't listen to those stupid unthinkable parents of yours. They Don't what funny is because thy've watching to much of that "Nanny" which just not as funny as the real comedy in this world! Beavis and Butthead is just out of this world. The Movie is 10x Funnier than those stupid animated comedy tv shows the little kids watches! B &B Would kid Barney the Dinosaur in the nads, they would murder Elmo, and they would destroy the tickle me elmo doll (not seen in movie, just a fact ppl). Yes Cornholio makes his apearance twice! Yes they still got the joke like when some guy says "Enterian Us" Butthead would say "He Said Anus". An No They still won't get a chance to score. But That's what the movie is all about. And at the end, they finally got ther TV Back! Get the movie (without leting your parents knowing)
