 "I'm just a country lawyer" begins James Steward as he tries to fend off a very young George C Scott and the new DA as they try an unlikeable Ben Gazarra for murder. So why did James Steward, the old DA, take on a case like this? That's the question I'm stuck with. By the way, I love how Otto Preminger directs a movie. Love how he changes Point-of-view and how he engages us in a courtroom battle. Brilliant staging, great performances...all typical Preminger. Do I believe the guy raped Lee Remick? Yes I do. Do I believe Lee Remick likes to lead men on and hungers for the attention of men? Absolutely! Do I believe Ben Gazarra was in his "right mind" when he murdered the guy? I don't know...is anyone in their "right mind" when they committ murder? But I do LOVE this movie. PS Where's the widescreen version
