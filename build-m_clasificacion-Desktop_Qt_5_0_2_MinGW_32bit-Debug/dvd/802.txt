 There are so many memorable scenes and performances, it's a travesty it hasn't seen a deluxe edition on dvd. It did get a respectable treatment from Criterion on laserdisc years ago, but nothing for today's audiences. Some of my favorite moments include the very opening when O-Dog lets the mom-and-pop grocers have it for being racist (and his reaction to watching the old man's head get blown off while watching the security video later in the film); the flashback featuring SAMUEL L. JACKSON (one of the greatest actors of our time), when he's at the table playing cards when the guy across from him gives Tat some attitude. The dialogue in the exchange is classic, amidst the smoke and dark haze. After Tat wastes him with several shots to the chest, he turns on another man seated and shouts "YOU OWE ME SOME MONEY, MOTHERF_____R??". The problem with the current dvd (aside from it being bare-bones on supplements) is that it is the R-rated cut. The better, more graphically violent, unrated edition is superior - unfortunately it only exists on the Criterion laserdisc. SPECIAL EDITION - UNRATED, DELUXE - NOW
