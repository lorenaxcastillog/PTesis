 Jennifer Galardi is an outgoing and motivating instructor and she makes you feel like you're having fun and actually happy to be exercising. You can buy this workout already on other online sites and I've had it for a week now and I'm really enjoying it. Three of the 10 minute segments are aerobic and one is butt and thigh and the last segment is an ab workout. The cardio ones are challenging but short (which I guess is good if you are wanting to get fit or increase fitness rather than maintain fitness). Obviously you can do all together or mix and match. The way the dvd is set up, you can arrange to play them in any order. The routines are all very dancy but yet not tricky and so this is very fun to do. I recommend this if you are wanting to boost your fitness, but if you are fit already, you may not find this challenging enough. It's cued very well and enjoyable to do. Jennifer is a good instructor
