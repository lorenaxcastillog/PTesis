 First up, I am not into ballet, or at least not very much. It's never been an artform that has grabbed me, with occasional exceptions. However, this documentary is one of the most beautiful, charming, witty and moving films I have ever seen (and I'm old, so that says a lot). The performers - some of them now in their 90's and still hale - are remarkable, and the ease with which the filmmaker moves through the history of these amazing two companies of artists is a joy to behold. I saw this on a whim in the theater when it first came out; I laughed at some of the dancers' memories, cried at the sheer beauty of the historic footage, and came out feeling wonderful about life and the magic that is performance art at its very best. At times funny, at times touching, always beautiful, this film is both a loving tribute to an extraordinary time and a consummate work of art
