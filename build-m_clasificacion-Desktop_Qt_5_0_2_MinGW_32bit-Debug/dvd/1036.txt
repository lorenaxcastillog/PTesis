 I love Kathy Smith and for over 15 years she has been the only fitness instructor that provides videos that I can follow expertly and use as a daily way of life to stay fit and motivated. There is no one else like Kathy. I love that being a fitness trainer was her profession before doing her videos so you are getting the real deal here. And she does motivate and educate with each video she does. I had been using her FAT BURNING WORKOUT on vhs for well over 15 years and last month my video machine ate the tape. I was devastated. I imediately went into Amazon and to my amazement it had just been released on dvd with 2 other excellent previous videos the month before. I had it shipped immediately and my wonderful routine is now fully intact. The picture and sound quality are excellent. Don't look any further than Kathy Smith. If you follow her example, directions and stay true to your routine - you will have results that will last. A+++ for putting her old videos on dvd at such a reasonable price.
