 I was not really aware of Majid Majidi until I took a chance on this movie the first time. It is a strikingly beautiful movie, a simple story deftly told. Not much happens in it......not much has to. Baran is the story of hard-nosed, selfish kid named Lateef whose cynical view of the world is changed once he makes a discovery about the "son" of one of the worker's who is out injured. He is tough on the son at first until he makes the discovery that the "he" is actually a she, trying to provide for the family now that the father is hurt. It is a love affair without very many words being uttered between the two. I won't say too much more so I don't spoil the entire story but this movie trancends language. You forget you are reading subtitles. It is a beautiful work, both in the story told within and the stunning cinematography. Hollywood could learn something from watching this movie. Buy it.....cinema is alive and well
