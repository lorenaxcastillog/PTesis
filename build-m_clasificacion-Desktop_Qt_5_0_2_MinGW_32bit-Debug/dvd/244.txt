 It could be argued that the brilliant and equally bizarre Mr Show, had a very limited, niche appeal...although I'm unsure as to why exactly. Well, that's not entirely true, as I have a pretty good idea of why that is...or was. Maybe the explanation lies within the inherent properties of average TV audiences being... well, why even delve into it, eh? Allow me to slather on high praise: I miss Bob and Dave. Bob was recently doing some late-Friday-night-oddball-flick-hosty thing on Sundance Channel. In fact, it was there that I saw the movie he directed, "Melvin Goes To Dinner," which I enjoyed. But I digress... Mr Show was original, intelligent, hysterical. Thank your lucky stars that the goodness of Mr Show's hijinks have been preserved in this format for you to enjoy whenever the mood strikes you. Break this DVD out at a party and silently muse over the obtuse, slack-jawed faces. Y'all are truly brutalizin' me.
