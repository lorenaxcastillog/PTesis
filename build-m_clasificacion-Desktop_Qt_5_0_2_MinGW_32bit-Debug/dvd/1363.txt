 I at first was not sure what this DVD was about, but being a huge John Ritter fan I bought it. I was not disappointed! It is mostly funny skits where John really shows off his comedic talents. Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood in "Three's Company.") and Suzanne Somers (Chrissy Snow in "Three's Company.") are also in it and together they are quite funny! In one of the skits John plays a father to a baby and he is very upset, because the baby would not stop crying and he wanted to see a movie. "If I cannot be firm on this with you, I will not be able to be firm with you on drugs, sex......" One of the funny lines in this scene. In another skit there is a large man (who also guest-starred in "Three's Company" in the episode "Macho Man") who was angy because the girl (Joyce DeWitt) only put two squirts of butter in his large popcorn. I don't want to "spoil it" for anyone, but this scene is very funny! I guarantee that this DVD will make you roll on the floor laughing! Recommended
