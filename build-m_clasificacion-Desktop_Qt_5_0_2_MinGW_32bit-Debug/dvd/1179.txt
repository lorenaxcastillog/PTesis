 I confess, I like pg feel-good family movies, but that is why I can recommend this movie!! it's great!! Joan Cusak is one of my favorites and she's awesome once again. Plot: Casey is a 'nerdy' physics 'geek' in highschool who works hard at school (and is good at it) and shares her mom's dream of going to Harvard. When a physics scholarship comes up to help her get into Harvard, she decides to apply the laws of physics to figure skating. But her scientific interest turns into a personal passion which takes her, her mom, the local skate-rink owner/FS has-been, said woman's daughter and son and all of Casey's guts to chase her dreams. Well? It's good. I mean it. The characters are not one-dimensional, they're real (though there are sterotyped fanatic parents--they're done in a fresh way). Best of all, there is no shallow, catty teen-girl drama. Instead everybody gets challenged, changed and redeemed... and then finally teary-eyed. Even you. Spoilers: love the foot in the ice bucket! Been there Casey!
