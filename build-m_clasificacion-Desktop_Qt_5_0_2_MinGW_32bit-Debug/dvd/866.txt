 I really love this workout because it's easy to do, but you still can get and see some great results. It's also done in record time which is good incentive for sticking to any kind of routine. The dvd is completely programmable so you can choose which order you workout in, whether you feel like the arms, butt or ab one first. Within these three segments, there are three, ten minute routines and each time it gets a little more challenging. There is a little count down timer in the corner to let you know that your time will be up soon and sometimes that's really helpful when you think you can't go on anymore, you only have a little bit to go. It keeps you motivated to progress a little more each time you do these exercises. While this isn't the most difficult workout out there, it's great to do when you are pushed for time, tired or getting started because again, it's easy enough, but you can still get results. I like this a lot
