 When you first enter law school, you hear the inside jokes surrounding this movie. Your friends joke about how your Contracts professor (or any professor) is imitating Kingsfield. You wonder why anyone would be so asinine to hide a book in a law library. You scoff and worry about the advice not to date anyone in your section, your law school, or your immediate vicinity period. If anyone told me that this movie would answer some of those questions and worries so poignantly, and do it in a way that would prove entertaining -- even to those wise/foolish enough to avoid pursuing a J.D. -- I would not have believed it. This movie has everything and then some for a curious 1L or for anyone wanting a more sobering film about law school that's not Legally Blonde I/II. Watching The Paper Chase is a rite of passage for any J.D. candidate in the United States
