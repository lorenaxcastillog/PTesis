 If your a Beatles or Mac fan no explanation neccessary. If you have Seen Mac in concert you know to order it straight away. Those on the fence who think they might like, it well let me put it this way. Much of this was filmed in Madision Square on one of those nights you could feel in the air you are lucky to be there. This guys blows you away when you see him becasuse: Those who are fans are blown away because he sounds exactly like you want and would image him to sound in concert. Those who have never seen him are blown away because they are suprised that he CAN BLOW YOU AWAY ! This guy is 63 years old here! Watch it and tell me if maybe you can understand a glimpse of why people went so crazy for the Beatles. 40 years later and he rocks shoulder to shoulder with the best doing it right now! Won't waist your money. Buy it and krank it up loud! You will have Fun
