 The primary focus of this movie is not on Panda but it is a story of an american woman whose husband dies in china during the search of Panda and leaves his diary for her disclosing his last wish that the original face of Panda be brought forward that of being a very calm and shy creature instead of what is propagated of being a fierceful and agresssive beast. The lady undertakes the challenge and starts the adventure for Panda. She is hindered by her late husband's friend who is a hunter and is after Pandas. In her quest to save Pandas she finds her helpless when a Panda is killed by her husband's friend in the end. She then adopts the baby of the killed Panda and brings it downhills with her to show the original face of Panda to the People. And thus the need to save Panda starts from that moment onwards and today they are perserved species. This is a true story and well executed. The only thing worth noticing is that Panda comes into play only during the last 5 or 7 minutes of the movie
