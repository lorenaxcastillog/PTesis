 This item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me. I love TamiLee and her Arms and Abs video from a few years ago. That's why I was excited to see what I thought was a newer production of Arms and Abs workouts. The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts. The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good. I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were. Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1! Because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than DVDs since you don't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this DVD is just a back-up for the tape I already use
