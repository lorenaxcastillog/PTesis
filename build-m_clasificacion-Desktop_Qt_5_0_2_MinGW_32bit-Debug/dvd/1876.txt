 I have watched this movie over 50 times since it came out the year I graduated from college. It is almost a sickness. I can literally quote the movie verbatum as I watch. Candidly, it has more one liners that my buddies and I still use almost daily than any movie I have seen. *Serpintine *What a Guy *Hookers?...no thank you General, thats very kind of you but we really want to wrap this thing up *yessss...it's better than a statue *the jungle...we call it the bush, they have sitezi flys there the size of eagles *they are protected against pilferage under the provisions of the guacamole act of 1817 *and on and on and on Get the movie, you will be using some of these lines the next day. The new version of the InLaws from 2005 was good, featuring Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, but it can't hold a candle to the old one. Peter Faulk and Alan Arkin should have both won academy awards. It is the best part ever for each of these legendary actors. Get the movie, it is a killer. JP "Gus" Godsey Virginia Beach, VA
