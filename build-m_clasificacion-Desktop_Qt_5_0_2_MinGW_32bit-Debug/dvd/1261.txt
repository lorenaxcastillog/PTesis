 Over the years I've watched THE CHURCH a few times on my grainy old videotape and I always liked the film, but now watching it on this crisp DVD by Anchor Bay THE CHURCH really comes alive. It's like watching a whole new movie! Back a few hundred years ago Teutonic Knights killed a bunch of people possessed by demons, then built a cathedral on top of the mass grave. Fast forward to the present day and thanks to a guy snooping around in the basement the evil spirits are loose and causing people to do some unusual stuff like suicide with a jackhammer and making love to a 9 foot tall goat demon. The story is a little confusing at times and often funny (the typewriter scene had me in tears), but any respectable horror fan knows THE CHURCH is well made and worth checking out, especially the scenes with a young Asia Argento. Mmmm.
