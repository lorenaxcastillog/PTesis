 I didn't grow up reading Curious George books as I was little. So this movie was my first exposure to the character, and now I know everyone in my family will be reading (and watching) George for a very long time. The story was cute and touching, yet at the same time it was fun and engaging. The animation was simple but very tasteful, giving the characters a special "glow" that made them stand out and offering numerous shots using angles that are not too usual in animated features (I particularly remember the one of George running on top of buildings trying to catch Ted -the yellow hat man- where the shot is shown from above, as if there were a flying camera focusing on George). In the end, you feel great when the movie is over and, to keep you entertained longer, there's lots of fun extra features to even teach you how to draw George. So whether you are a parent, a kid or simply an admirer of nice animated stories, Curious George is a winner for all
