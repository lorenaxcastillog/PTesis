 This collection is more of a documentary on the history of steel cage matches in the WWE. The documentary itself would be okay for a television viewing, but not a slightly overpriced DVD that advertises itself as something that it isn't. There were some matches that barely had any blood if any. Up and beyond that, most of these matches could almost be considered mid-card match ups as far as quality. One that that was upsetting are that there are no WCW cage matches circa 1990 on the disc. Wargames in that era were the only place a wrestling fan could find great, bloody matches guilt free (it was rare to see blood on WCW any other times, but when you did it was well worth the wait). I don't even feel this is worthy of a match-for-match rundown. If you find it cheap used, definitely pick it up, but I'd recommend waiting until it's in the $3.99 bin at your local pharmacy.
