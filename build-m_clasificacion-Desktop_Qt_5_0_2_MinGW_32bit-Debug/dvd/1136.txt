 If anyone is still in doubt about the virtues of the Free Market this is a must-see DVD. Watch as the 20th Century unfolds and unravells as virtually every socialist state collapses under the disasterous theory that the State can effectively control the market. How did Germany suddenly revive itself straight after WWII when the allies continued to struggle? How did Poland and South America pull back from the abyss of bankruptcy and tackle their hyper-inflation caused by Keynesian economics? "Commanding Heights" is a fantastic walk across the plains upon which The Austrian Economists finally beat the well-intentioned but flawed thinking of Keynes. It is a brilliant documentary about the battle of two ideas: Keynes' theory of a State Controlled Economy; and the Austrians who advocated the Free Market. Anyone who still backs Keynes after watching this DVD series is either mad or a politician who wants the power to control your business - and ultimately you. I wish I could award this DVD 10 Stars for recognizing the hero in every entrepreneur, and delivering some understanding to all those who benefit from the wealth he creates
