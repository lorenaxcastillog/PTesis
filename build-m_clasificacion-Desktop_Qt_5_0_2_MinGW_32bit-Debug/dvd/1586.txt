 Okay, so Adam Sandler DIDN'T get an Oscar nomination for this film . . . and the reason he didn't is because he's Adam Sandler. There's no other way to figure this one, as he lays bare his character's soul with revealing acting that seems very real and "organic." This is an extraordinary film; it creatively mixes pathos, sound effects, long camera takes, and claustrophobia into a heady combination. You can check other reviews for plot details. I would simply encourage the viewer to notice how nearly every "space" you see on-screen is tightly enclosed. Shot in apartments, industrial parks, and supermarkets, nearly every frame in the film takes place in a constricted and sterile environment . . . and this somehow makes the film's romance blossom even more dramatically. Frankly, I think this is a brilliant film, and a funny one as well, though certainly not in a HAPPY GILMORE sense. (SIDENOTE: I have five sisters, and since Sandler's character has seven, I may have been able to relate to his travails more than the usual viewer. You only children out there may find this film unfathomable.
