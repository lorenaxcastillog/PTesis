 Jennifer Aniston is good in this film, as the girl who is unaware of her talents or attractiveness. She's not an "every girl" in this role. She isn't anything really, and she seems to want that to be okay with everyone before she can move on. Her character feels the outside pressure to want more, but doesn't seem to. I liked that, and the sweetness of her relationship that develops in the end. I also liked the examination, if you will, of a marriage at its end, and what happens if you take away distractions and diversions from unhappily attached people and force them to deal with each other rather than the work of suburban or upperclass images. I felt that the couple with money wasn't dynamic in the way that I would have liked. They were supposedly happy, but I didn't feel that very much, and it didn't go anywhere from that place. But overall I liked this movie very much, and found it thoughtful, not funny. People might be put off if they wanted to see the kind of mainstream comedy the advertisements made it appear to be in editing. -Stephanie
