 As a Certified Fitness Trainer, I find this workout to be absolutely genius! It is a comfortable length, about a half hour, and includes a warm up for the abs that even stretches the muscles a bit to help get you prepared. The moves are very unique and target the entire core- from planks to crunches seated on the 14" Transfirmer- a tool I highly recommend. The moves are also modifiable for beginners. In the advanced positions, I think seasoned exerciers will find these creative moves to be quite challenging. Allie well cues the workout. The first two sets are begun seated on the Transfirmer in different positions to target the lower back, rectus abdominus, and oblique muscles. Then the exercises finish on the floor, shifting from one group to the next and completely fatiguing each area for maximum results. The workout ends with a satisfying stretch that loosens muscles you may think are unrelated to the abdominals- like the hip flexors and trapezius- but actually have a synergistic role in the movements. A genius workout- awesome music and excellent cueing. A favorite of mine! Kitka [...
