 I always this dislike those raunchy humor comedies(always with some expections like Harold and Kumar), many to list but In Good Company is a very original movie and fits perfectly as comedy and drama there is never a dull or slow moment in the whole movie all the chacters are likeable,Topher is a pretty good actor and he has a great future as a comedian(by the way i think Topher is a great choice for Eddie Brocks in Spider-man 3)he is very funny in "That 70 Show" too, Scarlett was excellent(i never see a bad movie from her), with no dobut one the best young actress in the actual hollywood,the story is great and original,drama works fine the direction also is very good and the movie skips any raunchy joke,in my opinion In Good Company by far is one the best comedies i ever seen and one my favorites comedies too,i gonna buy my copy! acting: 10/10 direction: 10/10 story 10/10 Overall 10/1
