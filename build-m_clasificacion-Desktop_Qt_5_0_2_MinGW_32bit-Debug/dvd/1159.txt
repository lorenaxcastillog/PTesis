 This is a great movie to own, especially if you're an obsessive Lucille Ball fan! Although this movie has been available in various 'underground' channels it's great to own a copy that is crystal clear the way it was first created and shown. Lucille Ball's performance is steller in this made-for-TV movie and a great showcase for the talent that the world usually associates with her comedic routines from her days in "I Love Lucy". She draws the audience into her plight and sympathy is garnered, possibly through her celebrity fame, for her character of Florabelle. Lucy had a difficult time in making this movie due to the heat of New York City while wearing her street wardrobe. She suffered dehydration and at the age of 74 suffered several minor strokes. With all this, she never let her performance suffer in this "Must-Have" movie! Concidently, Lucy's character, Florabelle, was named after her real-life grandmother! If you're a Lucy Fan - you MUST get this movie as an honor and tribute to the final movie performance from one of the greatest Red-Heads that ever existed
