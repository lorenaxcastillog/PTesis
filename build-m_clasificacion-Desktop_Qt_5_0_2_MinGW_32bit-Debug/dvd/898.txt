 Neither Mr. Broderick nor Mr. Washington have been favorites of mine in the past but I must give them their due in their performances in Glory. Both gave stunning and moving performances. The visuals that made you feel like you were there were astounding as well. Mr. Broderick does a wonderful job of portraying a character who is sometimes self-righteous and self-seeking and at other times inspiring and self-abasing. Mr. Washington provides the angry man to bring out the more sedate and clear-thinking Morgan Freeman character. All come together in common bond that builds in fighting together for a common cause. It is a somewhat one-sided and shallow portrayal of the war's causes that may not go over well with the lovers of history. But, the coming-of-age band-of-brothers mood of the film is moving and enjoyable all the same. No matter which side you may favor in that conflict (if either), you will still find yourself cheering with the rest, "Give-em Hell 54th!
