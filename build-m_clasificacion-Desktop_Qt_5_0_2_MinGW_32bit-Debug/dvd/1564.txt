 Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, "The Wind in the Willows" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own. That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group. It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, "The Wind in the Willows" could lead to a lifetime love of books. "The Wind in the Willows" reminds me of the Victorian humor book "Three Men in a Boat", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river. It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.
