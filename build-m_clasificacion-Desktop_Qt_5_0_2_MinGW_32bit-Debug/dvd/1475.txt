 Love these DVDs for keeping the "pure Pilates" method ongoing. Have been doing Pilates for 5 years with an excellent trainer (trained under Romana and her proteges) and do prefer the apparatus workouts. Had the amazing opportunity to take a private lesson from Peter Fiasca, (featured on these DVDs)the Classical Pilates Director, and also watched him go through the workout on the apparatus in person. The fluid moves learned with this method are amazing. I am 60 years old and can keep up with the 20 and 30 year olds on the apparatus. It has done amazing things for by body and health and I will continue to watch these DVDs and learn more. These are a true testament to appreciating the method and its results. You do have to have a good knowledge of the Pilates method (including the Matwork) before attempting to do some of the workouts. It is worth finding a 5 star trainer who has studied the Classical Pilates Technique. Great, great, great presentation
