 Charly (Cliff Robertson) is thirty years old and has the mental age of a young child. He works at a menial job where he is tormented endlessly, and he isn't progressing in his special night school. His teacher, Alice (Claire Bloom), recommends him to a clinic where an experimental operation has radically increased the intelligence of a lab mouse named Algernon. When Charly tests against Algernon on figuring out a maze, the mouse always does it faster. After he undergoes the surgery, Charly not only beats Algernon on the maze, but his mental ability starts to soar past normal to the genius level. He and Alice fall in love and make plans for the future, until, sadly, he learns one more thing from Algernon. Robertson earned an Academy Award for his stunning portrayal of the gentle, childlike man whose life changes completely. He is a mature and charismatic actor and gives a memorable performance. Claire Bloom is also wonderful as his teacher. The script is excellent, never overly-sentimental and always literate and thought-provoking. I recommend this timeless classic as an example of how good movies used to be made
