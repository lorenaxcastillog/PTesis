 paul's concert dvd's usually have a lot of talking during the songs making it almost impossible to get the feel of a real concert....not so with this one......the space within us....proves to be his best dvd ever.........i know hey jude and let it be, were only little snips, but....the rest of the dvd is awesome...by the way..jude and be are on all the other dvd's anyway.....the sound and feel made me get emotional a few times....iv'e been a hard core beatle's fan for 22 years now.....and only george's death was the only tear pour iv'e really had......this dvd shows paul as a real human....a 1 billion dollar human.....he is still paul....divorced.....rich...a bit ego{i would be too if i were the best living musician today}......paul is paul...and if you truly love the beatles group cd's, then most likely your'e in for a treat with their solo music.........this dvd was worth ever penny......it shows warts and all........too many people...I'll follow the sun...jenny wren...i will....etc.......i truly enjoyed it........kudos to a&e....
