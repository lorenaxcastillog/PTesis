 My kid likes to watch movies a lot. I've seen almost all of the Baby Einstein movies, tons of Elmo's world... you name it and we've seen it too much. Most of these movies teach and entertain our children, but few keep us adults in the mix. However, when this DVD goes in I actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then I ever expected. Laurie's voice is phenomenal, and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes. The harmonies show that this could be an everyday rock/pop band if they were to go that path. My daughter sings the songs and dances (which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the TV). She loves this DVD from beginning to end, and she isn't alone. The only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy I have them in my head when I am trying to get stuff done at work! "Under a shady tree, you and me..." hahaha I couldn't recommend this more to a parent with young children.
