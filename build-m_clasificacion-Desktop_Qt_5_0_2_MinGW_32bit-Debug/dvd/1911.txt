 It's not spectacular and there are better Disney movies that deal with the same issues yet resulting in some more laughs BUT this film is not to be disgarded. With a spectacular breakthrough performance by Anne Hathaway as Mia, a young socially retarded young girl who find out she is actually the heir to the throne of Genosha she of course freaks...I mean, she's already weird enough, now add a tiera. Her grandmother, the spectacular Julie Andrews, is trying to make her presentable enough for the Genoshian ball where she will announce Mia as the new Princess. But will she make it that far? With her newfound popularity Mia is faced with problems she never had before. She used to be invisable...now she has jealous rivals at her school and kocks now striving to get a taste of her...you know, because she's famous. She's now being used and thats not something she likes. This film, while not wonderful, surely has it's moments and while they may be spaced apart, they are still wonderful moments
