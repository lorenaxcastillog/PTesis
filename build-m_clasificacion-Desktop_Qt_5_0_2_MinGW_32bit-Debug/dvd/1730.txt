 I know I would have liked this a whole lot better if practically anyone but Nicholas Cage was the star, but I have to admit, he was very good here. This reminded me so much of the noir "After Dark, My Sweet", except there really isn't any love story. But the small town atmosphere, the drifter caught up, mostly because of a woman, the crazy bad guy, the greed-lust for money, the bedroom scene, are all there in both. This one had far more plot turns and twists, and was almost comic in its relentless violence. It was definitely a film noir, almost all scenes were at night, even in a graveyard. I was definitely caught up in this movie and many of the plot turns took me by surprise. Shot in Wyoming, the scenery was generally stark and bare in the few daylight scenes. Cage was almost a little too good to be true, but maybe not. Maybe I'm just cynical. With Dennis Hopper, J. T. Walsh, and Lara Flyn Boyle.
