 This movie would have to be one of the most overrated film adaptations of any of Stephen King's books. What you have are 4 losers who go in search of a dead body so that they can get onto the televison nightly news and become "Celebrities". This shows you how sensitive these four kids are. Then to show their delicate sensibilities each one takes his turn at bawling his eyes out. This movie stars the late River Phoenix who was a very Health Conscious guy. He didn't smoke or eat meat but he did like heroin which led to his demise. Sadly both Stephen King and the director of this trash Rob Reiner have confused the experience of adoloescent with a "Sensitivity Training Workshop". And by the way how come everybody in the audience expels blueberry pies? Did they all have the same thing for lunch as the guys in the Pie Eating Contest?I give this movie 5 stars because the Oregon Vistas are quite nice
