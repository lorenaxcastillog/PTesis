 Not being a world traveler like Elsa, I cannot afford to go to all kinds of teachers like she has done in her lifetime. I am fascinated by different cultures and I happen to like the different selections that Elsa has chosen to turn into 8 minute workouts. At first I only did my favorites, belly dancing and Bollywood, which I thought were the most feminine. As I put more effort into the Flemenco and Samba (which I think are the most difficult), I found myself also enjoying them too. The music is stimulating, no elevator music in this dvd. I know I can not look like some one who has been dancing as many years as Elsa has but it is fun! I did find it rather odd that she never speaks that it is a voice over. I enjoyed all of the performances however I noticed that the salsa performance is edited out of sync.
