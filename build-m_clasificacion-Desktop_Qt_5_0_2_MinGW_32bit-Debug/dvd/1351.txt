 In my opinion, this is the best of the Eastwood-Leone westerns. No point in going over the content, as other reviewers have already done so. Unfortunately, the single disc DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so if you have a 16x9 set, the image won't fill the screen. There is a 2-disk British edition available from Amazon UK (or EBay)which is far better than this one: it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, the picture and sound have been restored and cleaned up, there's a commentary and some featurettes (and it gets 5 stars). If your DVD player can play Region 2 discs, THAT'S the version to have. We were supposed to get this in the USA in fall 2005, but after Sony bought the MGM film library, they dropped it from their fall releases and I've heard of no plans to release it, or "Fistful of Dollars" or "Fistful of Dynamite," all of which received similar upgrades. Let's hope Sony changes their mind about that.
