 What can you say but that it's great we get to share in a treasure. It begins with Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks pounding out "Shower the People," which only gets better when Arnold joins in. Big, big song and you can tell already its going to be a big show. Some songs are close to what we usually hear from James, in others you can see that the artist is making the song their own, but that it is still distinctly a James Taylor song. If for no other reason you need to get this for Bruce Springsteen's version of "Millworker." Dr. John and Taj Mahal's version of "Everybody Has the Blues" is fantastic, and perhaps the unexpected gem of this DVD. There is little that disappoints in this disc. Even those who are not huge James Taylor fans will find the interpretations that the different artists bring to James' music interesting. But if you are a James Taylor fan you owe it to yourself to buy this disc
