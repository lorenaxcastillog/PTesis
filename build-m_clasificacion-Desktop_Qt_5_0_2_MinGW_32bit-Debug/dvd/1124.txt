 Mrs. Oliver Jordan is giving a dinner party for an aristocratic British couple, and the movie portrays a day in the life of each of the guests: Mrs. Jordan (Billie Burke): selfish, self-centered Mr. Jordan (Lionel Barrymore): good-hearted, broke, very ill Carlotta (Marie Dressler): stage star of 1890's, now washed up Larry Renault (John Barrymore): two-bit actor who thinks he's great; commits suicide Dan Packard (Wallace Beery): money magnate Kitty Packard (Jean Harlow): his floozy wife who wants to mingle with the rich; they hate each other (in real life too) Paula Jordan (Madge Evans): 19-year-old daughter, in love with Renault The acting is still very stagey; audio technology had not caught up to the camera yet. Marie Dressler is excellent and is fun to watch, though Harlow has always gotten all the raves; she's good but just a tad too over the top for me with her whiney voice, platinum hair, and outrageous costumes. A star-studded production in the manner of GRAND HOTEL, it was a big hit. Much has been made of its contributions to the art deco period in designs and fashion; as a motion picture, though, it all seems just a bit creaky now
