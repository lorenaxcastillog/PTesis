 I have seen the best results from this DVD. I used to work out to this DVD a couple years ago, before getting pregnant. I memorized the ab section, and some of the butt section; and I would do them a couple times a week to keep in shape. I am a small framed girl who gained 55 lbs during pregnancy (when I quit working out.) About 10 weeks after giving birth, I felt huge and my belly was still jiggly. I decided to try some post- pregnancy DVDs. None of them were giving me any results. I started watching this DVD again and slowly tried the routines again. It took a few weeks to build my muscles back up. I once again have a waist! People always comment- "You don't look like you were ever pregnant." My baby is now 5 mos. and I am so happy to be back in shape. This DVD is worth every penny, even for the ab section alone
