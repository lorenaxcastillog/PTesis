 This is a great thriller - simply that - and I was really surprised by it. I don't know why I spurned it when it was out in theatres - maybe because Rosie O'Donnell gave away who the killer was on one of her interviews, and I love her, but WHY give away the big surprise of Whodunit? If I hadn't known who the killer was, I would've been floored during the final act - as it was, it was suspensefully done. Many folks have covered the ligistics of the tale in their reviews, so I won't rehash it here. I'll just say I was really impressed with the acting and the camera work (so cool)! Everyone gives an excellent performance and the pacing of the film is well done. Lots of heart-pounding action! My only beef was with the very ending - I would've liked a little more of a resolution, so I'll probably check out the book to see how James Patterson wraps things up. Good film all in all. Suspenseful
