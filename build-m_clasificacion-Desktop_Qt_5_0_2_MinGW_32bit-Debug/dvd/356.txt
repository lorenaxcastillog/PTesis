 This review focuses on various human-emotion topics of the film rather than details of the storyline: I sobbed from a spiritual/soul epiphany sparked by this film. Films like this that dig beneath the surface of human experience are once in a blue moon. It demonstrates a sincere belief in the good of people- it speaks the message again and again that one's best is all anyone can ever do. It serves to humanize all members of a society, regardless of their actions (referring to battered woman and husband). It is a story of a group of individuals learning to listen to one another and harmonize- the choir is a metaphor for the grander society; an indispensable lesson for the well-being of our world. It is about release of judgment and fears. A beautiful film! If you enjoyed Life is Beautiful (Roberto Benini) or Together(another Swedish film)- you may really like As It Is In Heaven
