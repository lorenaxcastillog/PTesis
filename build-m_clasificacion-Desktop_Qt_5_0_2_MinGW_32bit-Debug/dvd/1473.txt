 This collection was the best purchase I ever made. My son from the time he turned 5 months old was like the Energizer Bunny gone haywire. He wanted to crawl wherever he wanted and if he didnt get his way, would scream and wail like a banshee. However, once I popped in this move, he was so in tune with the music, esp. the childrens voices and the bright, bold colors, it was the only way I could actually be with my son and spend 'quiet time' with him in my arms... He's 21 months old now and still LOVES this video! Even when my own mother came in town to visit, she was in awe by his reaction to this video. It completely calmed him. I would recommend this video to ANY Mom out there for their babies or toddlers or even for yourself; the music is great, it just makes you feel good! Now anytime a friend or family member have a babyshower, this is always one of my picks
