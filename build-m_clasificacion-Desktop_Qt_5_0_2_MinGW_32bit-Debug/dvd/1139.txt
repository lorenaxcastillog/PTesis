 This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances. Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly). I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates. Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses. People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it. For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale.
