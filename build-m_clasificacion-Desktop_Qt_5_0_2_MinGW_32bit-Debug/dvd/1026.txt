 well before they turned john jakes "north and south" books in a "days of our lives" clone complete with false endings and the soap mind set, this steller mini-series came out and was a ratings boom for c.b.s. and the answer to this civil war buffs dreams. the story starts just before the civil war as young john giser(john hammond,not the best actor in the world,but looking,and acting good enough for the part) heads north with his talent for drawing to work at his uncles newspaper in gettysburg!!!!!( see the set up for later stories)!!! the uncle sends john to cover the trial of john brown, the first of many historical figuers john will meet,and there he meets jonas steele(stacy keach,who is very good in the role) and they become fast friends. the rest of the show takes us from bull run, to the battle of the wilderness, to the death of lincoln(gregory peck in a small but great role one of his last). the whole mini-deries is done wiyh style and an eye for the true feel of the war. maybe not vthe last word in civil war movies , but one of the top 3 at least.
