 Wow! Practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and woo-woo sounding phrases, change your voice, and you, too, can be a CHANNELER! For money! I'm definitely in the wrong occupation. Has anybody ever thought to question "Ramtha" on a few specifics that a 35,000 year old being from "Atlantis" should know? Did Ramtha's ancient society speak Indian-accented English? What an amazing stroke of luck! What did Ramtha's people do for agriculture and diet, how was his/her society structured, what tools did they use, and where was "Atlantis" precisely located? I'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia--or how many years precisely, and in what reckoning? Could Ramtha show us some writing samples in Atlantean script? Linguists could help here. Or--is it just possible that JZ Knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we WANT and NEED to believe? Isn't that a more realistic explanation? What does that say about those who buy into this?
