 Directors, actors, and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral. It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal. 99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie). It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy. This falls into the latter category. I want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun.
