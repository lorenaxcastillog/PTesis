 I enjoyed the book so much that I ran out and bought the DVD. Although it was well-cast and entertaining to a degree, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed. For starters, this 4-hour miniseries is FAR too long. It dragged on painfully at times and could easily have been cut by a full hour (and very possibly two). Also, it focuses almost entirely on the struggle of the main characters while omitting most of the interesting scientific narrative and anecdotes that make the book so fascinating. The impact of the story is severely diminished without this narrative. Moreover, I think it is difficult to figure out what is happening during most of the series unless you have read the book first. It is unclear why many of the secondary characters exist, and their interactions with the main characters are virtually inscrutable at times. All in all, it is obvious that a significant effort went into this series but I think it could have been better
