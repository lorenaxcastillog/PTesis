 *Spoiler Notice* Okay, so maybe the movie was a little quirky, but this was the eighties folks. The thing about this movie on a VERY personal level is that I gave birth to our daughter in 1988 & my husband (at the wise old of nineteen, mind you) got to experience the feeling of watching me start to hemorrage (sp?) and be shuffled out of the delivery room with no explanation other than there was a complication. The thing is, while everything around me was in complete crisis, I kept hearing "Woman's Work" & didn't have the fear that everyone around me did, I felt calm and reassured. The sound of Kate Bush is always welcome, but at a time like that, it's an absolute gift from the heavens & after several blood transfusions, I got to see my little gift from the heavens - who is now 16! So, watch the movie for all of it, but remember that that situation can become very real, very quickly & the movie portrayed it beautifully
