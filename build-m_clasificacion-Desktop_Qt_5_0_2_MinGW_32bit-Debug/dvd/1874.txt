 My little sister got me hook to this anime a few years back withe the manga. Then she showed me Vols 1-2, so I decided to buy the complete collection and see the rest. First off Chi is so cute no matter what she does I see it as a innocent child would do. Very animes have good endings as for this it ended what I suspected however I wouldn't mind see it over and over again or have another season out of this. Even though Chi is a personcom/chobit the fact is it doesn't matter if she not human but having the will of choosing who you truly love is what matters this series taught me that. It starts off good until the later vols kick in everyone around Hedeki seems to have something with personcoms. Very emotional and heart warming I have seen in a while I am glad I brought it and all should enjoy it
