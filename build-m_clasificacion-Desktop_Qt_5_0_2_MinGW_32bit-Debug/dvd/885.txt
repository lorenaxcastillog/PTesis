 I am so glad that Paula created this video! When I am off season from dancing (I dance for a small regional modern dance company), I need to keep myself in shape. I use Yoga for flexibility and strength training, but I needed a cardio workout that didn't feel like "exercise". It seems that most of the aerobic/cardio workout tapes out there either spend so much time on instruction that you end up having to use the fast forward button all the time after the first time through it OR the moves are just glorified jumping jacks. This video is neither of those things... It is total fun! Yes, I realize that I am a dancer and yes, I did the whole workout the first time I played it (didn't have all the moves down pat...but did most everything). But if you are not a "dancer" just stick with it! I think you will find it worthwhile in the end. And isn't it better to be challenged? Anyway, for me this video gets a BIG thumbs up! Thanks Paula
