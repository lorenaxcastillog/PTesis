 Having had my appetite whetted to finally see this flick courtesy of Scorcese's fine "The Aviator", "Hell's Angels" certainly did not disappoint. While the soapy melodramatic love story surrounding a teenaged Jean Harlow and the two Rutledge brothers played by Ben Lyon and James Hall was corny, the aviation sequences were wondrously breathtaking. Kudos to Howard Hughes and his dogged determination to provide aerial authencity, especially considering the movie is 75 years old! The dogfight sequences and those involving a battle with a German zeppelin were outstanding. The story surrounds Monte and Roy Rutledge, two brothers attending Oxford who enlist in the Royal Flying Corps as WWI breaks out. The straight laced Roy played by Hall is infatuated with Harlow, who plays her usual role of a loose moraled party girl. Carousing brother Monte played by Lyon, unbeknownst to his brother had his way with Harlow and then off to war they go. Wearied by the stalemate the trench warfare WWI turned into, the brothers heroically volunteer for a dangerous mission. Flying a captured German bomber they plan to blow up a huge munitions dump that will allow British troops to overtake German positions
