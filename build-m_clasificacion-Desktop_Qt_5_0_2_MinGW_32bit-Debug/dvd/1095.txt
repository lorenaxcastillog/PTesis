 I LOVE THIS SERIES. You want action? Got it! You want laugh-out-loud comedy? Got it! You want some saucy mild adult situations? Got it! You want insane storylines? Got it! You want some bad-azz fighting scenes? Got it! You want a killer soundtrack? GOT IT! I love the fact that they use a hiphop soundtrack during the show. Mugen and Jin easily became two of my favorite anime characters of all time; they don't get along at all. in fact, they can't wait to get the chance to kill each other (coming dangerously close MANY times). The only thing keeping this whacky team together is helping Foo find her 'Samurai who smells of sunflowers'. I'm waiting for this boxed set to come out so I can finally stop watching bootlegged versions. The only other anime (besides Cowboy Bebop) that made me laugh this much is 'Golden Boy'. Here is my official grade for this outstanding series. Story: A Action: A+ Animation: A+ Soundtrack: A+ Characters: A
