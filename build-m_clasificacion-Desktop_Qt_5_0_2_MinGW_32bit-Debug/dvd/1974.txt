 The book Ethan Frome was incredibly good: the environment was created as a character, the people were characterized amazingly, and Edith Wharton (the author) forced sympathy toward Ethan and Mattie's "affair", which never extended beyond a kiss. The movie is horrible. Patricia Arquette appears to need speech therapy, and Liam Neeson's "limp" is more hilarious than telling. Their affair is much less believable, and by the end of the book, the only character that seems to be worthwhile is Zeena. Poor acting skills, poor script, and poor filming techniques all contribute to one horrible movie. It's too bad, really. They are quite good actors otherwise; this movie is just absolutely horrible. My favorite "love scene" between Ethan and Mattie: Mattie: (giving speech) I can't remember the rest. Ethan: You're cold. Mattie: Goodnight. Awww.... Rent it for a laugh. Otherwise, avoid it like Bill and Hilary avoid each other in public
