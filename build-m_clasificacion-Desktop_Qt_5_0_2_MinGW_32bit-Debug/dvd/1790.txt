 Finding Neverland is one of my all-time favorite films. It is magical, funny, soulful, and an absolute pleasure to watch! Throughout the film, a wonderful message is driven--it claims that even though we get older, we don't have to grow up. Its possible to pretend and stay young forever. It explains how time (crocodile with the ticking clock in its belly) is chasing everyone, and advocates people to really life, whatever that means for them. The film encourages one to believe--in themselves, in others, in magic, and possibility. The performances by all the actors are astounding. Johnny Depp was simply wonderful as the eccentric J.M. Barrie, Kate Winslet is great--as usual :), and the little boy, Freddie Highmore gives one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen. The young boy steals the scenes from the top-tier actors he works with to deliver one of the most heart wrenching and believable characters to the screen
