 This was made for TNT in 1999. It never ceases to surprise me how good most of the cable movies are and this is no exception. Noah Wyle plays Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates. I don't know how much of this movie is true. It's based on a book. Still, it was entertaining and I'm guessing most of it is fact based. Jobs and Gates are two very different people in personality. Jobs seems more creative and Gates more logical. Both are power hungry and will get it by any means. Lots of subterfuge. But Jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her. I couldn't understand how he could be so cold toward them. Especially considering his own background. I don't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film. Anyway, I do recommend this. It doesn't matter if you know much about computers or not. It's about how they built their empires and them as people.
