 Like many things that are introduced in your youth and resurface as you age, I found this movie to be on AMC about a month ago and absolutely adore the movie now. I have always been a big fan of the film work of Frank Capra and one of my favorite actors is Jimmy Stewart. I love Stewart's acting because it is so convincing and just filled with raw talent that is so inspiring. Between the scene where he begins to break the Elder Senator down with the statement " The lost causes are the ones most worth fighting for" and the scene where hes talking about the environment with his staffer, I always get goosebumps and that little tear in my eye. I also find his role as Jefferson Smith very inspiring as a young, idealistic populist in today's society. This movie will stand the test of time and more relevant than ever in relations to our current federal government today. I will always love this movie and after I graduate from school, I plan on teaching high school government and will definitely show this film to my students and hopefully will inspire all of them.
