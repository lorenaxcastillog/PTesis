 This DVD is the Best Historical Presentation of Martin Luther ever and the corruption that existed in the Middle Age Church, which would not change until there were such violent protest in Northern Europe. I recently purchased 7 copies and in total I have purchased about 12 copies to give as gifts. I also requested our local library purchase a copy. I do not consider this DVD as entertainment, but it is History done better than any other Historical Film. One should also research the events occuring in England, and the Americas which were part of the Holy Roman Empire, and understand that Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, is a great-nephew of Catherine of Argon, King Henry VIII's first wife; and that he is also a decendent of Ferdnand and Isabel of Spain. The DVD will allow you to see the logic behind selling Indulgences and the need to finance St Peters Basilica in Rome. This is a DVD that you will want to view several times as it is so profound. Peter Ustinov and Alfred Molina give unforgetable performances in supporting roles
