 I watched this film after reading the book. My wife was not sure if she was going to read the book, so she watched it with me. What a great film adaptation of the book. It should be, I believe the author also wrote the screenplay. The film really does show people that no life is meaningless. Everyone touches someone else whether they know it or not. We are all connected and all important. The film follows Eddie, who has recently died. It shows various snippets from his life up to the time he has died. He meets five people in Heaven that either he has had an impact on or they on him. He learns five lessons. The lessons prove to him that he was important, his life wasn't a waste, and that we are all important. Just as the book, I would not go into this thinking this is a true representation of Heaven. I'm pretty sure there is no swearing in Heaven, but who knows for sure. But, none the less, this is an entertaining film and it makes you think. Good date movie with your significant other!
