 Based on the true crime story of the same title written by Joseph Wambaugh, this 1979 movie is really well done. It stars James Woods ("Ghosts of Mississippi") as a cold-blooded cop killer, a very young Ted Danson (a household word because of "Cheers") as the police office he brutally kills, and John Savage ("The Godfather Part III") as the survivng officer who is riddled with guilt to the point that he engages in petty theft in order to be punished and ultimately is fired from the LA Police Department. While all the actors give fine performances, James Woods is outstanding as a manipulative killer. The title of the movie comes from a field of onions where the killers take the two police officers after they abduct them. I never saw this film when it was first released. With all the publicity recently about the Clutter murders in Kansas because of the movie "Capote," perhaps "The Onion Field" will experience a much deserved revival.
