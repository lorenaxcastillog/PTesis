 "Cry Baby" is the coolest movie since Grease that deals with this time period. The songs are good and the actors in the film are really excellent. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, and he came through in this movie and him in a lead role set in the 50s worked! This movie is not only a movie that takes place in the 50s, but it feels like a movie that was made in that decade as well. Everything that was big in the movies during that time are seen and used in here. I really enjoyed how this film also dealt with issues people had then and the way people acted and thought. I also love the music, classic Doo Wop. So if you love movies like Grease, then you need to see this movie. It's not entirely a musical like Grease was, but it still has a few songs in it. But to hear music from this time makes this movie even more real.
