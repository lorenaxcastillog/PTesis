 When my wife asked me to see this movie, I didn't think much about watching a movie about weddings. But what it turned out to be is this is one of the best movies I ever saw, and helped me appreciate Indian culture better. (Kinda like the main character, Darcy, of the movie.) Even though there are no suprises here, this movie made me think about the about the theme of the movie, which is class-distinction between "westerners" and "easterners". And any media or movie that helps unite people, and learn about other cultures in the process is a great movie. The Bride and Prejudice DVD brings romance, wit, and emotional force to your home. By the way, if you saw "The New Yorker" review calling this movie a travesty and ridiculous and enjoyable, just completely disregard that kind of review; it's like the weatherman telling you it is going to rain and be sunny on a particular day
