 I bought this set primarily for Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was too difficult to find on its own, and I'm glad I have all 3 now. Much has been said about the extreme darkness and violence of The Temple of Doom, but it doesn't differ a whole lot from the 30s comic-book style movies it pays homage too, other than some pretty overt sexuality. The supporting cast in Temple is the most annoying of the series, unless you're watching it with a 9-year-old boy (and I was) in which case, it's the most enjoyable. Sean Connery is priceless in Crusade, which wraps up the series with a tidy bow. As a parent, I was hesitant about showing this to my young son (it was a definite NO for my 6-year-old daughter), but the language is clean, the plots relatively simple (unlike, say, the latest 3 Star Wars flicks) and it does engender a spirit of adventure, plus a yen for world travel. All in all, a series we will watch many, many times over the years
