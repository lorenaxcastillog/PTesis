 Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we're onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I'd rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases.
