 Hello I won't sell you on the show-it's one of my favorites, and you can read other's opinions there. What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player. So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable. It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all. We don't have this problem with ANY other movies. SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK. All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP. What a shame. GOOD LUCK
