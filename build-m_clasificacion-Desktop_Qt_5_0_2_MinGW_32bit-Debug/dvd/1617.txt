 This movie was great! I read the reviews on the site and a few were not so good...thus, I was a little leary on whether I should buy the movie vs. rent. To my surprise... the movie came on that same night on a movie channel. I couldn't turn away from the tv. The movie was very touching. The cast of charachters couldn't have been any better. Jason Alexander, was the biggest surprise of the film. He did an amazing job. I will admit at first, I too was a lil leary about the flim within the first 15 minutes or so...b/c it wasn't as clear as it should have been. However, after the plot thickened so did the movie. This movie is a totally divine movie and a must watch for all alike. Absolutely, I will buy this one for sure and can't to watch again and again. BUY THIS FILM! You won't be disapointed and if you are ...share it with a friend and they might appreciate it more and thank you for giving it as a gift
