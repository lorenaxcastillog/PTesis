 There's a lot of things wrong with this movie....one being the wasted talents of its gifted cast. Nastassja Kinski (Cat People, One Night Stand), Alyson Hannigan (Boys and Girls, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Jennifer Esposito (Tv's Spin City, Master Of Disguise), Brian McCradie (Speed 2: Cruise Control), Steve Harris (Tv's The Practice, Minority Report), Todd Field (Stranger Than Fiction, Twister) and even the always awesome Alexis Denisof (Tv's Angel, Rouge Trader) are all burned out with a soggy script and its way too familiar and formulaic. It's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end. I really thought the accents of both McCradie and Denisof trying to do Russians was bad. McCradie is Irish isnt he and Denisof is like British..no, I'm not buying it for one second. Kinski, Hannigan and Esposito are all sexy but like I said....Not much fun...drags on a long time.
