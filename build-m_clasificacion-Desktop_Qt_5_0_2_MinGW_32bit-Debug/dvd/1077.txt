 Failure to Launch was quite of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates among others. A 35 year-old man's parents plot to have their son move out of the house (!) by hiring a professional who feigns interest in him... In short, the acting is generally pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is above average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The major setbacks are in relation to: 1) The weak plot and especially the weak dialogues, for which the writers are to blame. Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates were given weak lines. What a waste of a good cast! 2) The whole "nephew" issue was just ridiculous! 3) The whole naked father thing... 4) Parents plotting to get rid of their child is absurd. On a positive note, Zooey Deschanel is delightful as Kit. Let's see more of her... Though the potential for a decent movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers. In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it. Wait till they show it on TV.
