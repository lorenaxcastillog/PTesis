 Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters almost 20 years ago. This is an excellent concert DVD. The documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff, going to Graceland and seeing Elvis's grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music (which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing). But the music and seeing U2 in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent, charisma and stage performance is just magical. The music is great and Bono is the air apparent to the thrown of Savior of Rock and Roll. He is THE MAN. One highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with B.B. King. Also love the beginning, "Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles... we're stealin' it back," as an intro for Helter Skelter. The first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing. Then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color
