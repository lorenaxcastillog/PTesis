 Like my title says, this DVD is one of the best DVDs ever made. For months I wanted to buy it, but I just couldn't afford it. So I saved up for it and it was worth every penny. This also happens to be one of my all-time favorite movies so when I found out that the anniversary edition was available, I ordered it as soon as I could. This DVD has some really amazing features that I have not seen in any anniversary DVD so far. It has deleted scenes; Bruce Springsteen's Streets of Philadelphia music video; courthouse protest footage and interviews; Joe Miller's Macready & Shilts Legal Services TV spot; filmographies and more!! This is one of those DVDs you'll need to buy in order to have an awesome experience of how really great an anniversary edition can be. Though I have to say that I don't know if they are all this good.
