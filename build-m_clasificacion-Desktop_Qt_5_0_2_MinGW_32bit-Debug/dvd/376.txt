 Its pretty much a cliche to label an enjoyable movie a "classic". In my opinion, very few actually deserve to be called that, and this is one that does. For me, its the interplay between Chris Tucker and Ice Cube that makes it special. There are so many aspects of this movie that every person who's grown up in a Black neighborhood can relate to. Unconsciously, I substitute the characters in the movie to those I knew from around my block. Tucker, a natural comedian, is the undisputed star. Its strange for me to think that he was an unknown at the time the movie was made. I just got finished watching it again and laughed just about as hard as when it first came out in the theaters. This is the only one in the series that's worth watching, in my opinion. They should have done whatever it took to get Chris Tucker on each of the succeeding movies, and all of them would have been much better.
