 I wish I had found this video a while ago. My son was watching Baby Einsteins and then Brainy Baby videos. They are very entertaining, and Brainy Baby Left Brain and Right Brain are very educational and engaging too. Baby Babble has added something missing from our video collection and my son loves it. The two therapists focus on speech production with focusing on their mouth, movement and placement of lips and tongue too. Also, they add sounds of the toys that you see, and the toys are very visual and educational. My son is speech delayed and within four days of watching this video, everyday at least once a day, he added five new phrases to his vocabulary and learned to stick his tongue out and be more aware of his own mouth. He requests this video every day, and I would encourage anyone with a child with speech delay to try this video. I think it is very well done and the video is clear and professionally made. I'm glad we found this video. I would also recommend Braincandy
