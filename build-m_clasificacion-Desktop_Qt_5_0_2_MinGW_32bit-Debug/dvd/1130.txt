 Think of the most pretentious thing you can, please. But think carefully. Think along the lines of that red haired woman who appears and talks rubbish occasionally on Critical Mass, or of Geraldine Doogue (sic) discussing the afterlife on Compass with some vicars (sorry, non Australian readers!). Then double that level of pretension and you'll be approaching the near toxic amounts of utter codswallop to be seen on this, Maynard James Keenan's latest excursion into the world of pointless obscurism. Look, matey, like it or not, this is Heavy Metal. Therefore I want, no I need, explosions, lots of lights, walls of Marshalls and some gratuitous blood. This has none of those things. Just a short little whiny man in a wig boring the pants off of everyone who comes into contact with him. Of course, if you're a fan, you'll lap up every second. But you'll get what you deserve. I promise
