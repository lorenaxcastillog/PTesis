 Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick
