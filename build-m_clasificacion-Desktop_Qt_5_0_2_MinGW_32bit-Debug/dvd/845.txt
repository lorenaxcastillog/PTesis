 I had never seen Mr. Show on HBO before I got the DVDs as they came out. Like previous seasons, this one has a mix of good and bad stuff, with a lot more good than bad. There are tight, smart pieces like the prenatal beauty pageant and the life-raft talk show, but then there are dragging, corny sketches like the "Date with the Queen". It's evident from the commentary that even Bob, David, and the rest of the cast feel that there are some real clunkers that just didn't work. On the other hand, Bob is is often critical of sketches that work just fine, so maybe he's just on crack. There's a nice expansion of the cast in this season. Tom Kenny doesn't show up much, but B.J. Porter and Scott Aukerman have some hilarious roles. Jay Johnston is also more prominent, and he's always funny. If you liked the previous three seasons, this is definitely worth picking up. The writing, performing, and production values are the best of all Mr. Show seasons
