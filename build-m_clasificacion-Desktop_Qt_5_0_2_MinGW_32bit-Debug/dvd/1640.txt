 I'm reading some concerns about the screen format of BLOOD & WINE, but all indications are it's going to be presented in 1.85:1 format, which is widescreen. Amazon did mention it, but looks like the info is no longer there. But on other websites they provide specifics about the DVD. The question is will it be "enhanced for widescreen" or just letterbox. I hope it will be enhanced. It also appears to be in Dolby Digital stereo surround, instead of 5.1 surround sound. However, I hear the special features are going to be impressive with director's commentary, deleted scenes and some stuff on Nicholson and Caine...sounds pretty good to me. My only real complaint is the terrible box-cover. Not that the original poster was that great, but this cover art is just terrible. Plus it would have been nice to put Michael Caine on the cover somewhere as he steals every scene he's in.
