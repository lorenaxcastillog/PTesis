 This is my third experience with Ghibli studios and I am not disappointed. I am actually starting to develope a taste for their animation. The drawing and coloring was again as great as I expected. The movie starts in a very mysterious setting leaving you a little scared what would come next. As movie passes on you start to see new kinds of spirits. Not many of them are bad, they are just seeking a resting place away from materialistic world. The movie is in general not meant to be about scary ghosts or vengeful spirits. It is actually about coexistence of men and spirits and how they try to reach a balance. In cases spirits help men or vice versa. Myazaki explains in the special features how this animation is based on his real life experience and it seems that he actually modeled the little girl after a friends daughter whom he knew. I think generally this is a good movie and I also recommend that you have a look at other Ghibli creations too
