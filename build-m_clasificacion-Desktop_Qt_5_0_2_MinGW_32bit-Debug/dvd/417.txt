 It is hard to describe this movie because it brings out so many emotions. Without going into the story (you can read that already} let me just say, on the negative side, that it was a little difficult to understand in some parts because of the heavy Cuban accent when the actors were speaking english. Johnny Depp has a small but VERY memorable part. It was a surprise actually to see him in such a "camp" part. He makes a very pretty girl! In parts you feel a sense of urgency, you laugh, you are disgusted, and you heave a sigh of relief. It also brings back memories of history when Castro shipped out all the undesirables. [Imagine your homeland having a "moral cleansing" & branding you a pervert or disowning you because of what you are and what you write about without their censorship! So much for Communism!] You will probably come away a bit sad, but better for it
