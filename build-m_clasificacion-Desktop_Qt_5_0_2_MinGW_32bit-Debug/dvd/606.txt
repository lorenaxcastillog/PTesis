 Yeah, that's how I felt when I noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters. Even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture. How can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour? Regardless, it's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery. The kid is downright annoying but, when I was a kid I liked him! Suppose it's not time to have kids yet, aye? Regardless it could have been better. Flawed but, if you viewed this before the first one... don't let it stop you from getting the first! The first one rocked. I thought the 3rd one was produced much better than this as well... but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 I once again heard were terrible
