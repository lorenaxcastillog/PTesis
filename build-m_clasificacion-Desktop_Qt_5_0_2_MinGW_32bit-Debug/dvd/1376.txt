 This is one movie that you do not want to dive into the detail as it is fun to be surprised as it unfolds. Basically it looks as though some lucky sod in the village has won the lottery. The trick is to find out who it was. Then if found what chain of circumstances will it trigger. I about died laughing before the beginning credits and could not contain my self to the end. One thing led to another the snowballed out of hand. I could not believe the actors could keep a straight face. Now before you get the worn idea and thing this is some slapstick comedy or some Monty Python script. You would be wrong. This film give you the feel that you are there experiencing a small snippet of real live in a small village. This has depths like "Ladies in Lavender"; there are many underlying stories of the individuals and you want ton see how they play out. You will not be disappointed.
