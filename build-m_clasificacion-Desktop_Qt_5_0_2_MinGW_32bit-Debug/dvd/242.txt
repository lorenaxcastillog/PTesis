 Molly Ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant. She and the father get married and try to stick it out... she tries to work while pregnant, he tries to help his dad out... nothing seems to work. They get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother, which is difficult for everyone. Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does. Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from
