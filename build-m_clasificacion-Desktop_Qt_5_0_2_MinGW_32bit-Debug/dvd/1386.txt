 The third installment of this series was the only thing that kept me from giving a full 5-star rating. Of course the original is the best (c'mon it had Bacon, Ward, and Reba), but #2 and #4 weren't shabby themselves. My favorite thing about these movies though is something that isn't even in the actually movie themselves. See a few years ago my fiancee was in the hospital with the ear infection from hell. She was in the hospital for about 60 hours and asleep for most of it. I hardly left her side. One while she was asleep I was flipping through the channels and landed on USA which was having a Tremors Marathon, showing all 4 movies. It was great! I couldn't leave her side, but sitting next to a sleeping person all day isn't a whole lotta fun, but Tremors was there for me. Now I think about her everything I watch one of the movies. A must have for an Sci-Fi Fan or fan of the original
