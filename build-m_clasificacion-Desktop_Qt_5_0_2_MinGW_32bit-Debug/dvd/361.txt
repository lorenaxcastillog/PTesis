 I enjoyed this movie when it first aired on TNT, and only recently got around to buying it. As others have said, it's a reasonably accurate portrayal of the beginnings of Apple and Microsoft. Though, Pirates really shows its age today. Keep in mind that when this was made in 1999, there was no iPod or OS X, and the iMac hadn't been available long enough to show any sort of turnaround for Apple. Also at the time, Microsoft's plagues of security vulnerabilities and missed product deadlines were rarely published in mainstream media. So with all things considered, it's interesting to see this again, with today's perspective. As far as the DVD goes, it's pretty sparse on extras (a 5 minute clip of Noah W. and a trailer), and perhaps more disappointingly, is displayed in 4:3. I can't complain too much for a made-for-tv movie, but you don't really get tons of value for what this disc costs
