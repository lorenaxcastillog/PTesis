 I almost had her face tattooed on my body. My sister and I quote it like bible verses. The line about " How many of you want to wake up in a public bathroom lying in s pool of what you HOPE is your own filth" is on my phone. Devotion, or obsession? I do not know but what I do know is this is Hilarious! It's ridiculous but smart at the same time. My friend borrowed all three seasons from me one time and I got panicky.(Now he has my Arrested Development dvd and I feel that way again). Everyone I force to watch loves it...well all except one person. I won't mention her name, but we will never look at Liane the same way again. Anyway if you have seen an episode or two on comedy central and trying to figure out which season to buy, Season One is my personal fav. Of course you'll end up with all three... its addicting. But yeah season one is just one perfect episode after another.
