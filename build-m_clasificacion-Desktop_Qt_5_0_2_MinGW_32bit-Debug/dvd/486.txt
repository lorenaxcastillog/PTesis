 Well, my kids really enjoy this movie. They can actually sit through the whole movie & they are only 2 & 3 1/2. I don't want to make too many comments for the adults because I'm sure most adults aren't going to buy this just for themselves. I wouldn't recommend that but if you were looking for a movie to please your kids then I'd highly recommend this movie. I think all kids up to the age of 8 or so would enjoy this movie. Basically the story is that this little boy all of a sudden finds that he can hear everything that dogs say. Supposedly there is a planet out there made of up all dogs & Hubble the boy's dog has just been sent from there to grade the dogs on earth. So, like I said this is a movie I'd recommend for kids but adults might think it's a little far-fetched.
