 '24' Season Four is responsible for getting my husband and I hooked on the show. My sister begged my husband and I to watch "a couple" episodes of "24 Season Four". She even came to our home and sat with us. We had taped about six episodes but had not watched it. From the first episode on, we were hooked. We then purchased the Season Four DVD from Amazon. The CLARITY is much much better on the DVD than on a tape. (We have also obtained Season One Through Three, watched Season Five, and cannot WAIT for Season Six). For anyone who has not seen "24" I highly recommend it. One of the very best shows on television. Even a newspaper columnist wrote last Spring that Jack Bauer should be our next President! I guarantee, once you see one or two shows of ANY of the seasons, you will be hooked. The writers are of genius calliber with the riveting plots, and I marvel at how they can even create another plot...more extraordinary and phenomenal each time! The background music creates even greater tension. Outstanding is too weak a term for "24". It is beyond that!
