 This is a classic 1950s murder and courtroom drama flick of the first order. Jimmie Stewart plays the lead as a laid-back country lawyer as much into fishing as law, who gets handed a red-hot murder defense case. The local prosecutor brings in a big-gun outside Asst. State Attorney General (George C. Scott) to stomp on Stewart, and the fun begins... It is David vs. Goliath time in the courtroom! Lee Remick is really good as the town floozy, whose boyfriend (Ben Gazzara) shot a chap who allegedly molested his girl. I thought that Joseph N. Welch, as Judge Weaver, was particularly good, and in fact he was hilariously authentic. (If only more real judges were like him...) This film manages to be both funny and authentic, and avoids crossing the line into slapstick. The courtroom drama is more or less technically correct, although few lawyers are as skillful as Stewart and Scott are in this film. Although the law on "irrestistable impulse" has changed since this film, that fact detracts not at all from what is an engaging story and enjoyable viewing experience. Don't miss this one. The discerning viewer will enjoy this film many times
