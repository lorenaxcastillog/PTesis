 My 2 1/2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well. We tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he's taking them off again. So far he's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers. Thank goodness he's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth. Also like everyone else we've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk. I've always liked the Melissa and Doug products we've purchased but I wouldn't reccomend this easel at all
