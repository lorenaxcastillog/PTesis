 I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it. My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great. It still looks as good as the day we put it together. I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable. The material has held up great and still looks perfect. The wood is sturdy, with no cracks. It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll. If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs). For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out. It's not a big problem, though. Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it. We love the Badger Basket product line! I highly recommend this product
