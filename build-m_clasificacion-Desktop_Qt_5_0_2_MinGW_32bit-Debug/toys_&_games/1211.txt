 I have a daycare in my home. I bought this as a gift for my son because he loves dinosaurs. However, after one night of playing with it he had to have it in the playroom the next day. Every day since then that is one of the first toys that is taken out. They all fight over playing with it until they realize that there is enough dinosaurs for everyone to play with. There are valcanos, trees, and rocks in there to. I wish that the play mat was a little less flimsy, however it is very easy for the children to wad up and put back in the box. Overall this was a great purchase
