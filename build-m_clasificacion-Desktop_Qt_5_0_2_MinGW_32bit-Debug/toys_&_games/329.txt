 Ok, this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh. The first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price. As a stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's hard plastic under the fur. I love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do. Here's another trick. Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen, then have someone bring in the family pet. When I lunged at the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder. This may sound cruel but I assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing Scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him on
