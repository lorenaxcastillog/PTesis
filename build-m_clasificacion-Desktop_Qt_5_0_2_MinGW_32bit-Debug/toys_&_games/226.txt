 My son LOVES cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit, but like the other reviewers, we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries. He used the handle to push it, but the toy is unbalanced, so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face. He's had several big bruises and one cut lip. Since posting this, I've spoken to a rep for Little Tykes. She said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able (if ever) to use the dump truck again. If you've had a problem with this truck, please call them so that they can get it on record
