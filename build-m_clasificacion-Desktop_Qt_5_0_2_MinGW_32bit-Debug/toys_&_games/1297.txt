 Rummikub is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year! Celebrate by grabbing a set and enjoying a game with your family. It plays out pretty much like Rummy with cards, so it won't be a tricky game to learn, and you can even modify the rules to suit your favorite type of rummy (we like to play Gin Rummikub). This is a relatively easy game, most kids who have good counting skills are more than capable of playing it. One great feature about this game is that many elderly people love to play cards, but due to arthritis or poor vision, have trouble doing so. Rummikub solves that problem; the writing on the tiles is large and the tiles are easy to pick up and put down. Why not buy one for your family and buy an extra to donate to your local nursing home? The game is certainly a reasonable value
