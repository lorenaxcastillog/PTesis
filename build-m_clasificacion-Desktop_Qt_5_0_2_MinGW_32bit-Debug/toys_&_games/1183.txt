 This is the worst climb on ever made. It was a xmas gift for my kids needless to say it was not put up in the morning. We had 3 adults and it would not stay together each time a different spot would pop out. We took it back to toys r us and they had to use a huge mallet and bang on it to put in in the right spot. Well then the gardner came and the whole thing fell apart and that is how it is now. It is going back to toys r us tonight. This is the worst piece of junk, please dont waste your money. The kangaroo climber is awsome and didnt fall apart once! Forget this one they need to take it off the market
