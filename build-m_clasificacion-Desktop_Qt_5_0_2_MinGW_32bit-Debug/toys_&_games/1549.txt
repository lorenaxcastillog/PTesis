 I was given the Fisher-Price "Doodle Pro Glow" for my son's birthday. Although the concept of the Doodle Pro Glow is unique, the product itself fails to live up to its expectations. The pens that came with our BRAND NEW Doodle Pro were used and didn't last more than a couple of days. The screen is extremely hard to clean and I had to resort to using a window cleaner to remove the gunk that seems to get caked on. The product comes with an "eraser" which is no more than a piece of cheap dishwashing sponge that disintegrates after a few wipes (not to mention that it doesn't get anything off in the first place!). The eraser shown on the packaging is false advertisement since it is NOT the one you get with the product so Fisher Price should really change its advertising to reflect the true product. Fisher Price has always been a brand I've trusted and enjoyed so I was very disappointed at how shoddy this product was. Needless to say, after a couple of days I took the Doodle Pro Glow to my nearest ToysRUs for a full refund
