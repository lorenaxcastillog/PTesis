 Our 14 month old daughter delights in regularly playing with this WTP "book", and has for the past few months. She is a big fan of anything "Pooh Bear" (we've been reading his stories together since early on), and loves to hear his voice at her whim, and delights in the highly interactive nature of this toy. We also have the "Rhyme and Discover" version of this which she seems to enjoy almost as well as this one. We've found both of these to be durable, non-irritating to adults, and oh so fun for her and her friends of similar age. We would highly recommend this, and our only wish is that we had discovered it sooner
