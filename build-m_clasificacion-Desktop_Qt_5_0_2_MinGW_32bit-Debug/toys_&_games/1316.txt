 This game offers several games combined into one handheld console. It runs on 4AA Batteries, which last 30+ hours of play time. This is a great way to occupy the kids on long car trips if you can hook in to the "in car" DVD or video player Don't expect the quality of a $100 X Box controller. But for the kids it's great. Warning! Do not start playing this game if you are an adult. It will suck hours out of your life in a flash. I have purchased 3 of these games so far because we have worn the buttons out. I wish I could pay more for a better quality controller, but heck it's a $20 kid's toy. The fact that I would keep buying the game after we wear it out should tell you that it's fun
