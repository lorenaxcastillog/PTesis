 My son saw this advertised on tv and begged for it for Christmas. I looked for it everywhere and finally found one last one on the shelf right before Christmas and thought it was a great score. Wrong! After playing with it for 10 minutes, watching the Alien "balls" fizzle like Alka Seltzers til they exposed a couple of cheap, plastic toys, he completely lost interest. The van is poorly constructed and the parts do NOT fit back in, nor does it stay together. Just TRY to store it on a shelf without it falling apart and spilling its contents everywhere. This piece of junk is going right in the give-away bag. And my son won't miss it
