 As the mother of a little girl I have alot of experience when it comes to plastic playsets, sadly most of them have little attention to detail and are poorly made, my daugther started eyeing this when it first came out in the stores and asking for it. She just received it for her birthday and I think I was almost as impressed with it as she is in love with it. The attention to detail is amazing on a $20 plastic toy, working lights (batteries included!), mail box that opens (and is full of letters actually addressed to different ponies), working drawer w/ bottles inside that snap onto the top, little shower brush, etc. She's been playing with it and the smaller ponyville sets I got her nonstop for days, excellent value
