 I played Yahtzee as a kid with my Dad and had forgotten how much fun it was. While looking for some non-electronic games to play with my kids, I stumbled across Yahtzee and instantly remembered the good times. Introducing the game to the family tonight, I was hoping that they would enjoy it as much as I had years ago. They did not dissapoint me and after playing several games they all complimented me on the choice. Another reviewer called Yahtzee "quietly educational", and I completely agree with that term. My oldest, who since his school started letting him use a calculator in algebra and geometry has lost the ability to do math in his head, suddenly rediscovered his math skills when his score was on the line. The only thing Milton Bradley did wrong with this game was being cheap on the size of the pad of score sheets they include. Other than that, this is a classic game that has not lost anything over the years. Turn off the television or computer and play this game with people you love.
