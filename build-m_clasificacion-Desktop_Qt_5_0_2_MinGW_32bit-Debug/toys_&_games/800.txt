 This toy seems unfinished and cheaply made. I got it for $15 at Toys R Us and I certainly wouldn't pay more for it. It is small, doesn't have an on/off switch, and the characters barely look like themselves. It definitely doesn't look like it will last long, just not well made. BUT...my 15 month old daughter loves it. My 3 and 6 year old boys got bored with it really quick but it does keep my daughter's interest. She loves the wiggles. The characters pop up and down when you play they keyboard and it is easy for the little guys to play with it. I hate toys marketed to little kids and it is too hard for them to manipulate it to make it work. The music quality isn't too bad and it does have two different volumes. Not that annoying for the adults. The music only plays for a couple seconds at a time. Not a bad toy but they could have done so much better.
