 Inspired no doubt by Dungeons and Dragons is this magnificent set in Fisher Price's Imaginext line. Dragon keeper Dungeon is home to the terrible fire-breathing, Red Dragon and his Goblin henchman. The set allows you to a variety of different looks to the dungeon with pieces that are interchangeable to get the look you want. Also makes it easier for little ones. The set features various gates and trapdoors that can be opened and closed. The dragon figure is well articulated for posing atop or inside of the dungeon. The dragon can also shoot out fireballs to make him more menacing. Of course the set is compatible witt the other Imaginext sets as well. Contrary to the other reviewer, I've found the set to be quite sturdy and well constructed. Great looking piece
