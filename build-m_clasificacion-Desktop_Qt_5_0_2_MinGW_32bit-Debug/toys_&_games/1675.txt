 Cloe is the most prettiest one in the Rock Angelz collection.I have Jade too.Jade is also reeeaaaallyyyyyy cute,but Cloe is the best. This collection is very well done,and the clothes of all the dolls had a hard work on them.Specially Cloe`s clothes.And their hair and CD and accesories. These dolls had a very well job on them.My most favorites are Cloe,Jade(which I own)and Yasmin(which I might get)But Sasha and Roxxi are cool too.I think Roxxi had too much black eye shadows,more than the others,but her face is pretty anyway. Cloe is my most favorite from this collection,and also my most favorite Cloe doll ever. You must get her.It`s fun to play with and pretty.And the CD includes to songs:"So Good" and "You Think". *BYE* P.S.I am getting a new Bratz tomorrow,but I can`t tell who it is.The better you find out tomorrow.She`s very pretty,and it`s one of the Bratz I want for my birthday.It`s not the twiins Oriana and Valenitna
