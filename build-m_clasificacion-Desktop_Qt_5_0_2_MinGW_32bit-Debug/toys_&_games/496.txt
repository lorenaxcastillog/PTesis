 My daughter recieved this kitchen today, and she absolutely loves it! The bins on the left side really need a back on them so that things don't fall out. I would recommend putting this toy together with a ratchet equipped with a screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you will have a sore wrist because it takes a while to get the screws through the thick plastic parts. This toy is definately designed to be durable. I am sure it can withstand whatever my daughter could do to it. Overall I think it is a good investment and a very cute toy
