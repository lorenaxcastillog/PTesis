 How can you have Thomas and not Percy!?! With his infectious grin, gentle nature, and cheerful green color Percy has nearly as many adventures as Thomas. [It is not that Percy has an adventurous spirit. Percy is happy just shuttling cars in the Yard. It's just that adventure just seems to find him.] He gets covered with dirt, coal dust, rocks (in a landslide), and delectable chocolate (my favorite story--lol). He also has run-ins with Chinese Dragons, Jack Frost, Dirty Diesels, and troublesome trucks, etc. Five Stars. For the Thomas crowd I would think Percy would be a necessity because he is at the center of many an adventure. Certainly he is my own son's second favorite Steamie. Typical sturdy construction. Percy is a nearly always a happy little Steamie that is lots of fun to play with.
