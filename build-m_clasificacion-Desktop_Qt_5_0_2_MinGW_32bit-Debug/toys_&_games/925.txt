 After months of my friends son saying all he wanted for x-mas was a huge elmo doll. I seen this item claiming to be a "large" 25" doll i agreed on spending the 60 something dollars and get it. When he opened it my friend had said it was small and looked sick. All they did was extend his legs a few inches and his belly strunk. Needless to say i was highly disappointed and had to dish out 30 something more dollars for one that was alot bigger and cheaper. So if you think that your getting your moneys worth on this doll forget it. I suggest the "large elmo soft plush doll" by fisher price.
