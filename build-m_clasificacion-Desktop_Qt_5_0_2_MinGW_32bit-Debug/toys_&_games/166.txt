 This playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child's imagination. My son received this as a Christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater, but a house, cave, secret hideout, restaurant, and schoolhouse. Very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills! The only downside I have with the theater is that it is not very durable. The theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws, etc. It slides together and a child can easily disassemble it. The front panel that the child rest's his/her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater. Other than the durability factor...great product
