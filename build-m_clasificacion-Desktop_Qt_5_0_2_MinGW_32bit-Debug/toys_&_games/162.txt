 I have checked out almost every card shuffler in the market. And I can tell you that apart from the one made by Excalibur they are all the same, and Cardinal is not an exception. So here is my review. This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 2. Door Stop 3. Play Street Hockey 4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 8. Condom Dispenser Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.
