 Three of us played this game--two parents and our 11-year-old. The first game took a long time because we didn't realize a key part of the game was getting to/from the ports. We spend all our time "out at sea". But our 11-year-old still asked to play again two days later! The second game took about 20 minutes, was fast-paced and a lot more fun (but almost too short!). The third game took longer, and was still interesting. We waged battles and had a lot of fun with the games at each port stop. The clues and games were even fun and challenging for us adults. There ARE some gray areas about the rules, which unfortunately is common in most new games these days. But we easily came up with guidelines along the way, and there wasn't anything that kept us from enjoying the game. I'd also like to say that the setup and cleanup is a breeze--they actually designed the game box to hold all the pieces neatly once you put them away! This is another place where I think a lot of games today fall short
