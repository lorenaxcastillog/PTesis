 My son loved the learning table so I really thought the pots and pans would be a big hit when I purchased them when my son was 8 mo old. I could not get the product to say anything but, "Red pan in, Red pan out". I called the hotline at Fisher Price and they told me to change the battery which I had already done. While I was on the phone, my son dropped the pot and it began to sing the alphabet song. The cust. service rep. told me that the pots said and sang things at random and that it reponds when manipulated like a child would. I was disapointed because the toy responds VERY randomly and usually only sings if it is shaken very hard or dropped. I really feel I wasted my money on this one
