 I love the Dora castle & we've had lots of fun with ours. My only issues with it are Dora's (fabric) dress always falling off (& frustrating my daughter!)--it should have just been painted on or fitted better, and this table. My daughter has a hard time with it--but I'm not sure if it would be difficult across the board with other kids, or just her. So, we still love this, it's very cute. One of the best things about the castle & all the sets--you don't have to put all the stickers on yourself! I've spent many a birthday or Christmas eve up all night sticking on stickers & getting angry when one ended up crooked--so KUDOS to Fisher Price for doing the hard work for us
