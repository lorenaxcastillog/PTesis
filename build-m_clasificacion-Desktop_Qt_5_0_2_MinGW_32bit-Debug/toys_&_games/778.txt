 My daughter absolutely loves this playset. It's fairly small compared the 'normal' sized playset and comes with different mini-ponies (depending on where you buy it). The mini-ponies are about the size of the littlest pet shop figures, without the bobbling heads. The accessories however are TINY, and I wouldn't recommend this set around any child younger than 4. The mini-ponies themselves are fairly sturdy and solid. There's a lot of attention to detail to the playset. The are also lots of cute accessory sets that can be purchased for under $10. I like the fact you can buy packs of the mini-ponies for around the same price as a regular sized pony. This is a great way to have a good sized pony collection for your child, without having to give up lots of room. All in all, I think this Ponyville theme line of mini-ponies from Hasbro is a keeper and a nice addition to the My Little Pony world
