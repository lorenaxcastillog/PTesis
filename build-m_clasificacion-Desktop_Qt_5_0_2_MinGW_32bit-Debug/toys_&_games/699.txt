 Imagine if you were a cat, would you... 1.) nap all day 2.) bring your owner dead mice 3.) be a scaredy cat 4.) constantly cough up hairballs. You know what you would do, but perhaps everyone else thinks differently of you, and unfortunately, the majority rules. We loved this game. In this game you write names on a board with a dry erase marker. As each person rolls the die they move around the board landing on certain names and then reading the "Imaginiff" question about that person. The names you all choose to write on the board can be those of the people playing, people you all know who are not there, or even famous people, it is all up to you. In fact, that aspect of the game makes the game virtually brand new every time you play it. We had many laughs finding out what we all thought of each other. Don't have thin skin though because you might just leave with a bitter taste in your mouth
