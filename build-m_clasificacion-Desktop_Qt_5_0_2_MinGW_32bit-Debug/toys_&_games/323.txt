 My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it! They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations. It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best. My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures. A piece of advice though: This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations. Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem! I can't find the extra figures for this thing! Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere. Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day. Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game. Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!
