 I got this game when I was on vacation with my friend. We pulled it out and we were so confused with how to win and all the different cards and stuff on the board. So we immediatly put it away and said oh, what a waste of money, but then we tried one last time, read all the directions and have been playing ever since. My friends and I call each other "frnchie" and the characters names like "boris." It's fun and it gets a lot of laughs. I would recommend this to anyone. I can't wait to get simply suspects!
