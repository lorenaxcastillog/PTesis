 I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She seems a little young and I was skeptical but she has older siblings who enjoy it with her. She is just a tad too short to open the microwave easily but it won't take long until that is a non issue. The stove button is easy to work and she loves the cooking noises, which are not annoying like so many other toy noises. I know I can trust it to last since it is Little Tyke. It is great for those of us who don't have much extra space as it takes up almost none yet has plenty of things to play with. It is also great that it comes with a few items to start out with
