 I'm not sure what the people are talking about with the three foot radius. That's how mine were at first, but I finally figured out how to make them work. They are more or less of the average 2 mile radius. I wouldn't expect too much, come on people! These are KID's toys! They aren't going to give a 7 yr. old a pair of hundred dollar talkies, now would they? The main trouble was getting the battery. After we had the batteries in, it came the testing time. They work pretty well, Except if it is below 60 or 50 degrees. Then, Only one will work, and not even that well. But, I have figured out how to make them quiter without turning them off! Hold you're hand over the mouth piece really tightly... It should elimanate most of the static. But, for ten dollars, these are a very good pair. I am however saving up for the Uniden Ten mile radius 20 dollar adult walkie talkies
