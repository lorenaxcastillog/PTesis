 When Deal Or No Deal debuted Christmas week last year I was keen on watching it because of my dislike of bald guys but when I saw Howie Mandel on it I fell instantly in love with him. And so when my dad bought me this game I could've never been happier and so far it's been my favorite personal item to take in my Baby Phat purse, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS GAME, Very addicting { I once held up a mall trip by playing it}, Has the actual music though it's not the rock version of the theme, Has a resume option to continue in case you go to the grocery store and you want to put it on hold, WHAT I HATE ABOUT THIS GAME, No batteries in some games, Howie Mandel's voice is not featured in it, Overall a wonderful game for the DOND fan, Enjo
