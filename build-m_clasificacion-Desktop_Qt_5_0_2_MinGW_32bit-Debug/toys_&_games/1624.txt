 I bought this for a 1-year olds birthday about 7 years ago. My husband spent the month before the party, pulling the string. He was sad when I took it to the birthday girl. I looked high and low for another one for him. After about 8 months, I again found it. He loves it. It is such a stress buster as you simply gotta smile when you hear the Quack, quack, quack. When my aunt and cousin (both adults) came to visit, they too fell in love with it. Unfortunately the store I had found it at was out again. This was 3 years ago. I found it again today and bought both the store had left. I plan to get some additional ones to have on hand. I truly believe that every adult needs to "feed" the kid in him/her. So, if you think this toy is only for children 10 months - 5 years, think again
