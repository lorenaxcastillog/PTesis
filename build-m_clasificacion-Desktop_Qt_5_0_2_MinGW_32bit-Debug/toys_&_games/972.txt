 We have pretty much all of the POTC toys that have been made! The Megabloks Black Pearl pirate ship has a lot of detail and a lot of pieces. We have two of these and they each took about 20 minutes to build. The ships are fragile so if your child likes to play rough they will come apart. My 7yo and 4yo boys love them anyway. They are rich in detail and my kids are into their imaginary play for hours with them. We also have the Zizzle Black Pearl pirate ship. It doesn't have nearly as many parts (not the "Lego" style like Megabloks) and is bigger. It has some cool electronic noises and trap doors, but is not as detailed as the Megabloks version. The Megabloks version has real sails too. The Zizzle ship has no action figures, so you have to order the 3" figures separately (my kids just use their Megabloks figures). Their other favorites are the Megabloks Flying Dutchman (built a lot like the Black Pearl) and the Dead Man's Chest. These sets are a must have for the POTC fan
