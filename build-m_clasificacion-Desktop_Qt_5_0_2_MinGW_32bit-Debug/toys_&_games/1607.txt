 We were visiting my inlaws in Europe and they bought this toy for our 20 month old daughter. Out of all the toys we brought over she played with this everday. We actually had to ship it back with us. Now she is 3 and my youngest is 1 and this is still the most popular toy in the house. It have the typical shape sorter and hammer combo, but the stairs where the bear pops out and the cars are the big hit. I would recommend this toy to anyone. Very durable, washes it up great, and still fun even after having it over a year. We have bought many other Chicco toys and this is still the winner. I have never written a review on Amazon, but believe this deserves a five star rating
