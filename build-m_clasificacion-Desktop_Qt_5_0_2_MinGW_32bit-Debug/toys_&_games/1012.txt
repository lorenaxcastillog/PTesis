 Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the swing seat I bought for my 3 year old son. Since it only has one string (it is actually more like a string than a rope) holding the seat, it is really unstable and my son has a hard time swinging. I have to push him since he is not that advanced yet to doing it on his own and therefore the whole thing always goes crooked or he leans too much backwards or forwards which is not his fault, it is just really hard to balancethe swing seat on one string. Therefore, I don't think that I would buy that swing seat again. Next time I will buy one that has for sure two ropes holding on to it.
