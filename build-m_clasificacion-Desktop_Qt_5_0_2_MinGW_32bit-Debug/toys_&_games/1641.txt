 I bought this for my 22 month old for Christmas. She loves pressing buttons and making stuff happen (Pooh's voice), and picking up the handset. Now that she's 24 months, she finally "gets" it when Pooh asks her to "Call Piglet!", and she presses the number 3 which has Piglet on it. Frankly, I'm not sure it's worth $19.99. That's how much I bought it for, at Walmart, but if this is your price range and you want a toy for a child who is at least 18 months of age, and maybe up until age 3, then this is a great one, in my opinion
