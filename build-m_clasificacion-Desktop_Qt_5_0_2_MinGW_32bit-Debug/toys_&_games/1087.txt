 This was perfect since it combines a picnic table and sandbox into one unit. My son can sit in the sandbox and keep his drink up on the table within reach, but out of the sand. As the sun moves throughout the day, we simply take out the umbrella and stick it in the ground where ever we need the shade. Before we filled it with sand this year, we used it as a pool too. The only problem I found was the lid does not fit too great. We've had a lot of rain this year and it flooded out the sandbox. We now keep a tarp over it to prevent having to replace the sand - which if you've ever had to dig out a flooded sandbox, is not fun
