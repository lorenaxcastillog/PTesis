 This is a beautifully made puzzle that is a good challenge for 2 year olds. Under each piece there is a picture of the inside of the object (what's in the backpack, what's under the shirt, etc.) which is extra fun. The buttons, laces, zipper are large enough for little hands. It will take some time for the little ones to get the hang of completing the tasks, but it's time well spent and they'll feel great once they can do it. Wonderful for those who are beginning to want to dress themselves ("I'll do it myself!" they say, right?) Now, they have a way to practice those skills so they can feel successful. Highly recommend this
