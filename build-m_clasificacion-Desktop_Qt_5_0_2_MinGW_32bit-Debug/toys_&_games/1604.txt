 This Read with Me DVD helps kids with letter recognition, matching lower and upper case letters together! It also emphasizes rhyming, which is an important pre-reading awareness. My daughters and I found out about Chicka Chicka Boom Boom from Blue's Clues, so when this showed up Christmas morning, they were so excited. My almost four-year-old daughter understood how to use this toy with only minimal instruction from me. She watched the dvd "read" the book to her, and then she chose to play games based on the book she had just read. It is very interactive, educational, mesmerizing and entertaining. She will play with this for 30 min-1 hour, asking me questions every now and then. She likes that she controls what happens, whether it's just reading or playing the games. She asks to play this when she wants to be a "big" kid. She thinks she's playing video games, just like Dad
