 The photo here of the Beach Glam Ken doll doesn't really do him justice. I bought him at my local drug store before I saw him here at Amazon. He's very cute. Maybe it's the lighting when they took the photo that appears here at Amazon, but overall it makes him look pale and washed out. If I hadn't seen him right there at the drug store and only made my decision by the Amazon photo, I most likely would not have bought him. As it is, I'm glad he's now a part of my collection with my other Mattel Barbie Beach dolls and her other friends. I plan to do a photo story using the Beach group sometime this summer
