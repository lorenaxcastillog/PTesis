 Yeah, it is your standard cheapo type of construction that one is accustomed to with Barbie/Mattel products, plastic is flimsy and ours (we snagged the only 2 left at Target, one for my daughter, the other from my niece) even had scratches on it. However, it fits everything that my daughter has, could be bigger or more compartments for the clothes/accessories since as any Barbie fan knows, you can have a ton of it. My daughter has been using her Barbie rolling bin non stop since I got it. I am hoping it lasts at least a few years, crossing my fingers. Lis
