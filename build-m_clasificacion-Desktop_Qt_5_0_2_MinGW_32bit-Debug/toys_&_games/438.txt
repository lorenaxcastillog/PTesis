 This is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc. It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes, rusty nails, and the occasional coin. Adjusting the sensitivity is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily, which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one. If you get one, make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find. PS It also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls
