 This game is clever! It really is loads of fun for kids to play and at the same time (without their conscious knowledge) they are improving their word skills. The game has a spinner, which, off-the-bat makes kids interested. Next, all kids play each round which ensures that nobody has to wait their turn (waiting for their turn in a game to my kids seems like slow torture). Since, they are all playing in each round there is lots of competition to come up with the best and longest word to fit one of six categories (ie. boys or girls name, living creature, food or drink and I can not remember the others). All and All - a smart and fun kids game
