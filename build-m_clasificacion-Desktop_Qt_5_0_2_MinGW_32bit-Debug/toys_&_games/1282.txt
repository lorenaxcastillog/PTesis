 After the torrential rains of June, I bought the 90's game this summer as a rainy day activity for my beach house. But we didn't just play the 90's game on rainy afternoons, my housemates were itching to play this game when they woke up, on the beach and before going out at night. The 90's game is a fun game for groups -- never a dull moment, even if you didn't watch every re-run of 90210 and Melrose Place! Everyone can dominate at least some of the categories -- whether you are a music buff, sports fiend, movie aficionado or TV nut -- but it's never too easy to win, nor too difficult to cause boredom
