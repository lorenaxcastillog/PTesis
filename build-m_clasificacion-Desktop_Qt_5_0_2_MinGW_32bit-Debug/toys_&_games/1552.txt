 We got this bike for my 2 1/2 year old and it's great. He can peddle himself and learn to steer, or I can push him and make the handles stay straight. The handle that pushed from behind is tall enough for an adult, yet if my son wants to push, it goes down to his size. I like the size of this XL, the regular fold 2 go seemed too small for my growing boy. The best part is if he doesn't want to peddle, the peddles don't move, so if you're pushing him, his feet don't have to go unless he wants to peddle. Overall, a great bike for a learning toddler
