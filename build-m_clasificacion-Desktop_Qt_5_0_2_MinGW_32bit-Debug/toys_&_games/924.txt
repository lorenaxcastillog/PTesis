 Binary Arts really did a good job on this peg game. I owned Rush Hour, a other great game from Binary Arts, so I thought it would be just as fun as Rush Hour but with Frogs instead of trucks and cars. It is simple to play but gets harder as the game goes on. They give you 40 cards to play with. Each card becomes harder and more challenging. To play you must move one frog at a time. You must have only one frog left on the peg board to win a game. This game is full of fun for the whole family! I recommand this game to anyone who is looking for a rainy day game or just a fun game to play with when the kids are bored
