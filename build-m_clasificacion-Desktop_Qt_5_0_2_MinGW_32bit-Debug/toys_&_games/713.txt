 My 16 month old son loves motorcycles and I looked high and low for a toy motorcycle that is sturdy enough for a child under 3, but still looks like a real motorcycle. Finally, I found the Motorcycle Hauler. Not only, are the motorcycles sturdy, there are 2 of them (one for each hand). My son also likes to push the truck around. The only thing that frustrates him is he cannot put the motorcycles on the flatbed by himself. Something he will be able to do when he gets a little older no doubt. This is a great toy for my son and he enjoys making the motorcycles go vrrrroooomm! Worth every penny.
