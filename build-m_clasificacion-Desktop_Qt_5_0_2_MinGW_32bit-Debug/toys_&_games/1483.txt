 I ordered this to use at my parents house for the holidays. Just opened it and there's about 10 different sections to 'pump' air into. I got to the point of blowing it up like a raft. Anyway, there was a slow leak in the seam of the 'dashboard.' Read the directions and it says to use the patches except on seams. Great. What are we to do then? I called the company and they said to return it because there's nothing they could do, they are out of stock or discontinued. I tried the patch. Nope, it didn't work. Disappointed daughter, frustrated (and now out of breath) parents as well, with no place for my daughter to sleep now for the holidays except to get something spur of the moment.
