 I bought this for my 5 year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it. Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued. It is a great idea, but needs better construction. On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her. However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it. The drawers work fine. The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out. Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out. Need to be glued in.
