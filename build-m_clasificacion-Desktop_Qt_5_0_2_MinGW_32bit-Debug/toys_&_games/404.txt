 Our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home. True, the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there). We've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box). The simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment. It's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old. It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery
