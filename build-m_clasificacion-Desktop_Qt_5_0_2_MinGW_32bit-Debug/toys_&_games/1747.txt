 Want to have a fun night with friends, then invite them over to play Eat it! We had friends over and I was confident I would blow them all away with my snacking and sweets knowledge (after all I am the friend that kept candy under her dorm-room bed!), but, surprisingly it was suspenseful to the end as to who would win. The questions are funny, thoughtful, nostalgic, and challenging. We were in stitches most of the game and playing it provided a great way to relax and enjoy the evening. I haven't thought about Fun Dip or Sugar Daddies in a long time! If you want a walk down memory lane -- you have to get this game. But, don't be fooled, it will challenge your snacking knowledge! You will even walk away learning a thing or two about how snacks & sweets are made -- a little educational bonus to impress your co-workers the next time you catch them taking a snack break
