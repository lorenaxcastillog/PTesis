 We purchased this wagon for our daughter to celebrate her first birthday and she loves!! We spent the entire day Sunday pulling her up and down our driveway and she was singing, smiling and waving the entire time. We have used it every day this week; in the yard, at the park, at a friend's house. It is sooo cute and really versatile. Plus it was super easy to put together, which my hubby liked! In fact, he said it was the easiest "baby" item he has assembled. :-) It is a bit pricier than some wagons, but definitely worth it (esp if you get it here with the free shipping deal) We paid a total of 129.99 and found this exact wagon for sale several other places from 149.99 up to 179.99 PLUS shipping! Buy this one, you won't be sorry
