 My daughter got this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. Not only does she love putting the puzzles together - and double the fun being two-sided - her 4 yr old sister also enjoys it. It is useful to teach more complex concepts to our 4 yr old, such as 2 triangles make a square, 4 triangles make a rectangle. Both girls really enjoy this toy, as with all Melissa and Doug toys, it is very well made and will withstand abuse. Just wish it was easier to fit the plastic cover on, we can't seem to fit the shapes neatly to close easily, especially in a hurry. A minute inconvenience. A great toy
