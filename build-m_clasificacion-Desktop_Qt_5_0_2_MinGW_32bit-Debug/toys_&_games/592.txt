 OK, so my daughter appears to like the toy, but it is driving me crazy!! The music and the singing voice are incredibly annoying -- by far the most annoying of all her toys (which is saying something). Furthermore, whatever educational value there may have been in the voice saying "red pan in" when the red pan is placed on top of the yellow one was subverted when my daughter figured out (within 2 minutes of opening the box) how to press a button and get the same result. So we just hear "red pan in! red pan...red pan...red...red..." over and over. I personally am suspicious that these toys that have so many sounds and lights and music and voices etc etc do not encourage the development of imagination.
