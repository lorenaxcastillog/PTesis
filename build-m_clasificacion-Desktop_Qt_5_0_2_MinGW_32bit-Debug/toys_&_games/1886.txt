 This horse is named Paciica. She has a dark peachish color skin with a brown muzzle and brown stockings.She comes with 20 red beads,10 shell beads, and 10 rubber stoppers that keep the beads from falling out. Her saddle bag is a pinkish reddish color. It makes a great space to store the beads and holds a rolled up beach towel that is green with orange flowers. The saddle blanket is a light, washed-out yellow with different orange flowers than the saddle bag's beach towel. The saddle is red-brown with some silver and dark brown parts and a white seat. Her stable has a see through beach scene in the back, and drawn hay on the stable's floor. The stable is small enough top fit under most beds.If you get this horse you should be satisfied, and you will get your money's worth. I recommend the cali girl horseback riding Barbie to go with this because she has items for the horse, and because she fits perfectly ontop of Pacifica. Thank you for reading my review
