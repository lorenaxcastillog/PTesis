 My daughter got this for Christmas and it only says, "Know what goes good with everything? Ripped Pants!" Then he sings, "You won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants." and then says, "This is so embarrassing!" My daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we can't get it to do it again. It seems like it's stuck in the "demo" mode and we can't figure out how to make it work. I called Fisher Price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time, Probably due to the fact that every parent who's child recieved this toy is calling to complain.
