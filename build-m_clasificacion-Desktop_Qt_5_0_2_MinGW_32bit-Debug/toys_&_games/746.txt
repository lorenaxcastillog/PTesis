 This Fisher Price Loving Family Twin Time Dollhouse is a favorite of my 3 1/2 year old daughter. We gave it to her last Christmas and she took right to it - especially since she has twin brothers (5 1/2 years old)! The dolls and furniture are the perfect size for her little hands to maneuver in and around the dollhouse. I suggest getting as many family members as you can - especially if you have extended members (ie grandparents, siblings, babysitters, older cousins, etc) like we do that play a big part in our daughter's life. This makes for really fun pretend play! The African-American family is a wonderful addition to promote diversity as well as the SUV for the family to buzz around the neighborhood (read: playroom)! Some of the furniture makes "real life" sounds with moving parts. This helps in making this dollhouse more realistic! This Christmas we'll be adding the Backyard Cabana and Laundry Room
