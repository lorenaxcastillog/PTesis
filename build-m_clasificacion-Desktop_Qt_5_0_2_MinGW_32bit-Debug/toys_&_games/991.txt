 This lego set is great for toddlers/preschoolers. Considering the high price of Thomas the train toys, I think this is actually worth its price. We got it for our 3-yr-old son who loves Thomas and loves playing with the duplo legos. We also got the large box of duplo legos, which was really necessary to give him a chance to really get creative. He makes up some interesting trains, but I think it's only because he has so many legos to work with. So if this is your child's only duplo legos, you might not be as satisfied with the 'playing' results unless you purchase a small box of duplos to go with it
