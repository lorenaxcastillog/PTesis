 My mother got this game for my daughter's 9th birthday and it has been SO much fun. My daughter is a horse nut and it can be hard to find horse related board games. We enjoy playing it as a family and my husband and I even broke it out the other day with no kids in sight,lol. The games are easy to learn but not so overly-simple as to be boring to older players. My daughter enjoys the one-player options at times when no one else is available to play and my husband uses the factoids on the cards to study up and be able to understand my daughter and I when we start talking about horses
