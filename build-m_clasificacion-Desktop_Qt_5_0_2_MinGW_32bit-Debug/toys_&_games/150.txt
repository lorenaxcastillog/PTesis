 Don't waste your time with this thing. By the time we invested in the toy, the batteries, etc. we had quite a few dollars into it... for about 15 minutes of fun. The toy can't just be set down on a table, so when my son actually gone bored with it (to my shock because he LOVES bubbles) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining GOLD solution all over. Yuck. Mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash. This toy is just a gimmick - stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money
