 I bought this kit solely for the prism to show my kids how the light split into a rainbow. The prism is such poor quality plastic, that the light doesn't even go through it correctly. I could have made a better prism in my oven with plastic pellets and a form. The sides look like a cake top that fell, causing the light to not go through it correctly. The rest of the kit sucks too. I put batteries in the flashlight and the plastic of the flashlight cracked and crumbled in my hand! The cardboard cutouts are ok... if you want to pay lots of bucks for cardboard cutouts and the included soda straw.
