 I would say that while I think 7 bucks is a bit much my son has had constant play using this and has definitally put 7 bucks worth of use into it I think. I do agree that they should be included and I also would like to find one of the lego tables although someones suggestion of fixing them to a board or something might just be an idea. My son has used them to build hotels on or even makes his own "game grid" or mazes or even maps. He is 7 and I have to say he loves this thing and I plan on maybe getting him another. I nearly forgot to add that while some people have seen durability problems we haven't. It has even been stepped on by his older sister and while it left a faded green mark it did not bend it or anything. It has been very durable for us.
