 My son received this game for his 3rd birthday and he loves it. He already knew some of his letters but not necesarily the sounds that go with each letter. He has only had the game for a few weeks and has learned many more letters, more sounds, and songs that go with each letter. I also have a 5year old that enjoys this game. It is too easy for him, but reinforces what he is learning in school and is one of the few games that he enjoys playing with his brother that he doesn't think are "baby games". Another thing that I like about this game is that it can be played with just one player. I have set this up for him a few times on the kitchen table while I cook supper and he can play with just supervision
