 We played CHAROODLES for the first time at a family gathering, with 10 of us (ages 12 to 50+) playing. We played one team against another. In your turn you have 90 seconds to get your team to guess 8 charades, while the other team keeps score. Normally in charades this would be impossible, but here the 8 items all belong to the same category (like things on the roof or household chores) and everyone knows the category ahead of time. But the most fun part of the game is the props (a foam ball, foam rod, foam square, and plastic cup). You must use one or more of these in doing each charade. This results in some amazingly quick correct guesses, and some hysterically funny situations! You can't help but get hooked on this game. We ended up playing three games, and everyone had a blast! If you like charades or other party games like CRANIUM or OODLES OF DOODLES, don't pass up this one!
