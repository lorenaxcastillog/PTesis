 I'm really pleased with this toy. I didn't want one that would fall over easy or that spoke Spanish. I just wanted a simple toy that my son would enjoy for longer than 5 minutes. This is it. My 13 month old can pull himself up easily on it and play with it. I do lean it against the wall since it would slide on the hardwood floors but we haven't had any problems with it. He keeps going back to it to play with it and it's one of the first toys he plays with in the morning. I think that because it does so many things he doesn't get bored easily. It does alphabet and numbers as well as colors and texture and shapes. Then you can switch it to do music (which he loves to dance to) and the keys all light up which grabs his attention. My 4 year old enjoys playing with it as well.
