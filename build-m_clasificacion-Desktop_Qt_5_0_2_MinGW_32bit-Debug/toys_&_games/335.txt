 I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my 1 year old nephew. Very pleased with the online price through Toys-R-Us and Amazon.com, it was $50.00 less than in a retail store! Very prompt shipping, had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools. Very nice quality wagon, top of the line and well worth the money. Rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children. I also purchased the pad set. Fits perfectly, looks great nad comfy ride, but be sure to purchase the pad set for the Model #29 All-Terrain Cargo Wagon (BP-29), as other pad sets will not fit! Very nice onverall. Don't hesitate to buy!
