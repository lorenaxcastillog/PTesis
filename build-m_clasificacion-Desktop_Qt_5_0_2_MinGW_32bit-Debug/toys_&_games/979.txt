 The person who received it is very happy however I am very diappointed with the billing. I had a $10 gift card and it would not reflect the discount when I tried to purchase online so I called in and talked to someone. He said that the discount would not show up immediately online but it would be applied when my card is charged. Well, I was charged the full price without the discount. That was very disappointing and I didn't take action because I am busy and didn't want to have to deal with it. Instead I told everyone I know about my bad experience
