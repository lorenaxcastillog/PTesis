 If there was an option to pick "no stars" for this item I would! This has got to be the worst organizer made. On top of serving no purpose, Toys R Us AND the manufacturer are not willing to work with me in exchanging it for something functional! The bins sit on 2 wooden poles per rack. There is no center support in each rack therefore when you load the bins; they fall down onto the rack below and so on. It is very frustrating and it only sits in my son's room to collect dust until I throw it out this weekend! I highly recommend avoiding this organizer and manufacturer! What a waste of money and energy!
