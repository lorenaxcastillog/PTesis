 Just bought this for my son, it arrived in the mail today and from the second my 20 month old even saw it in it's package I was racing to get it out of it's box because he was so excited - really cool looking car! Then all you do is follow the name...Shake & Go and the car is off racing. My son was just amazed that all he had to do was shake it and off it went...He loves chasing it as well as me shaking it and sending it in his direction so that he can catch it and send it back to me. The sounds are also fun and the styling couldn't be better - love the price too! I'm definitely buying more
