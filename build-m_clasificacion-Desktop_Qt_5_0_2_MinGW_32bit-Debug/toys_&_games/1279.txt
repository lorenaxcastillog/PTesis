 I can't believe this! I remember at the begining of the 90s, people treated the 80s as a LLLOOOOOOOOONNNGGG time ago, I completely different era. I was only 5 when the 90s started, but it still drove me mad in the 90s when people talked about how LLLLLOOONNNGG ago the 80s were. Whenever people in the 90s said things like "Oh, that happened way back there in the 80s" I'd just get a confused look on my face! It was just a few years ago people! Now, what does this have to do with this game? Well, people today are doing the exact same thing! They treat the 90s as being way back there, even though we're just a few years removed from the 90s! The news, music, and culture of the 90s are not way back in another time. As far as I'm concerned, they still fall under the category of "current events" as opposed to the "ancient history" label people are starting to give them. Its 2005 people! The 90s aren't ancient yet
