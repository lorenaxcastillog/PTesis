 We bought our daughter this little giggle phone thinking that Sesame Street would be a trusted vendor that would use the highest quality materials to construct the toy. Our child put the toy in her mouth once and chewed on it a little bit (as many kids do)....and we noticed that the paint on the eyes had immediately scraped off. We took that toy away and haven't given it back. We just wanted to let others out there know that despite the age recommendation, if there is any chance your child might put the toy in their mouth, then this is not the toy for you
