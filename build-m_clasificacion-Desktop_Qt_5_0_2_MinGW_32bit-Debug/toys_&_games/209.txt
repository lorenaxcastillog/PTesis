 The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun. However, the one we got doesn't work at all. I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode. Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words. I prefer the rules of the old version better. I'm planning to return this and get the old version
