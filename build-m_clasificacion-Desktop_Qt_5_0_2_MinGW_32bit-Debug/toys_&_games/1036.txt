 This is the greatest toy we have ever purchased. It was a Christmas present for our younger daughter, who was just 6 months old at the time. She loved it from the first moment she saw it by the tree. In just 2 months she has learned how to open and close all the doors, move the numbers for the address, get the shapes out of the door, ring the doorbell, move the hands on the clock, change the sun and the moon, and press the buttons on the radio. She plays with this every day, either independently or with others. An added bonus is how much fun our 3-year old thinks this is too. She loves to play house with her sister. I would recommend this toy for anyone
