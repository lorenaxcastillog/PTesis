 My 4 y/o daughter and 2 y/o son both love this toy. They enjoy having their very own "CD player". There are 3 discs that they can play and there is also a convenient storage space on the back of the player to hold the two that are not being played. I think this is very smart because other similar toys do not have this space and we ended up losing some of the extra CDs. The microphone is wonderful for them to sing along with. There is also a three setting volume control... great for the parents! The only "negative" comment would be that the songs on the CDs are on the short side, with a few barely 10 seconds long. All in all, a fun durable toy that has remained a favorite with my kids for several months now.
