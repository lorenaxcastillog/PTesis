 There is some great activities on this toy, but there were problems on both sides. On the first side, the only way to get the face to light up and play music is to press hard, and hold the face for a second--what infant does that? Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press. My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though, if it is the only toy around. On the older side there are much better activities. He is enjoying those more, but the pop-up feature won't work. It does not stay closed. If I do get it to close, just touch it and it pops up--you are supposed to learn to press the button. I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it, and 8 of 10 had the same problem. I haven't seen a better crib activity center, so we are still keeping it (mostly because I am not a returning type)
