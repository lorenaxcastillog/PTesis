 I have to start by saying my kids love this bike. I have a 2, a 4, and a 6 year old. They all can ride this bike because of its versatility. The problem is with the front wheel. And you can't have a working bike without a working front wheel. We bought this bike for Christmas, 2006. 3 months later, the rubber strip they call a tire, wore through, split and fell off. The plastic rim is splitting. Basically the front tire just fell apart. Our other trike, the #33 Classic Red Dual Deck Tricycle has held up just fine, with a nice solid front wheel. If your kids ride this as much as any normal, healthy, doesn't sit playing video games all day, kids do - then hold out on this one. Get something with a better front wheel or wait till they redesign this front wheel
