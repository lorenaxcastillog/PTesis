 This is a cute story. It works well with the leap pad system. My only problem with this is I am very tired of this Pooh Story. Disney seems to have put this out in every medium available- dvd, video, books on tap, leap pad, computer games etc. There are other Pooh stories that are just as cute if not cuter. I'm tired of this one and so are my children. If you have a Leappad book, I'd look at other stories before getting this one. It is a bit light on the activities compared to some of the other books. Enjoy.
