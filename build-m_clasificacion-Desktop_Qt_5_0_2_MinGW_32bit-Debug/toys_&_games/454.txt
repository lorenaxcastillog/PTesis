 My 7 year old son got this set for Christmas last year, and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids, this K'nex set gets the most use. He built with it every day for months, and still builds something new about every week with it. He has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas. We've gotten a lot of the models on video tape, and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones. I loved the sea turtle that "walked" across the floor, and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them. This thing keeps him busy for hours at a time, and he's getting another tub of them for his birthday. His little brother wants one for his birthday this year. The motor is very cool, and he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for it. Since Christmas, he has only broken 2 pieces, so I thought that was pretty good. Highly recommended
