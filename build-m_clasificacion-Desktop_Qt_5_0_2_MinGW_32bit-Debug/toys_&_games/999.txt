 My son (4-1/2) was given this as a Christmas gift and it's the hands-down winner for best toy in the household. We have two other "marble run" toys - one made of wood blocks the other of plastic - and this is by far the most creative, versatile and exciting to use. Each of the color-coded blocks does something a little different, which makes for endless variations in building runs. The "twist and rail" set is an excellent starter since it has such a large variety of pieces. There are several layouts included in the pamphlet with step-by-step illustrations that our son can follow by himself. It takes us parents a little playing to remember what each color piece can do; so it's a fun challenge for young and old alike. We can't wait to add onto this set!! This is an heirloom-quality toy that is will be played with for many, many hours of fun by all of us. It is very sturdy and well-designed. If you think in terms of money spent per hours of play, this is a sound investment
