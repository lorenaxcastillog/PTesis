 This table went together in no time (more time was spent opening and dumping the 4 50-pound bags of play sand). My daughter got this for her birthday and loves it. The only improvement I would suggest is to have a drain hole in the center leg or a cap to cover the opening for the umbrella. We had the umbrella out for less than an hour and the center leg was COMPLETELY filled with sand so we had to move the table (and what was left of the 200lbs of sand)to let the leg empty and put the umbrella back in. Otherwise a great table
