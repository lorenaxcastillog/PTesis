 I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back. If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats. When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats. The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats. Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon. I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon
