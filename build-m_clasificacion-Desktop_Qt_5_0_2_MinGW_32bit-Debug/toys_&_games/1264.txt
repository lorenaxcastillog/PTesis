 I was a little worried about purchasing the Magic Doorbell House, as I thought it would be too small for my 3 year old daughter who is 41 inches tall. I didn't want to spend $200 on one and my husband didn't want to get the cheaper one($80) either. My husband and brother in law put it together in 25 mins. My daughter loves it! I'm real happy my husband went with this house...it frightens me when he goes off to shop alone...I thought he might indulge our daughter with a $250 or more Playhouse. I think I speak for most of us when I say these things are pretty overpriced
