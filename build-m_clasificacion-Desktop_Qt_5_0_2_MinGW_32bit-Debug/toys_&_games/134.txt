 Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too). We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.). Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time. The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse. After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before
