 This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc... My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa. He only wished he had found it sooner! My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister. Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater. We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children. All the others we researched were too small for our needs. The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company. All the kids gravitate towards it
