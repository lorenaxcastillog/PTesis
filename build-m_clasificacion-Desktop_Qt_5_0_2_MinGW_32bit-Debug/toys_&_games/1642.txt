 My husband and I bought this ball for our son's soccer team. Even though it is not his regulation ball size (he uses a size 3 ball) We decorated it with the team colors, wrote each kids name on the ball and put "Sharks Game Ball" on it. Each kid gets it after a game they played with teamwork and sportsmanship(not just scoring) and they can take it home and do whatever they want with it for a week. The ball has lasted so far and the paint has stayed on. I do wish it came with more paints or the opportunity to get more. It does not cover very dark. Hope this gives someone an idea.
