 This is a great toy for kids of any age. We bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2. She still plays with it. It folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside, it still looks like new. At my son's 6th birthday party (13 boys, 2 girls), the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm, while the other kids beat them with blow up swords. Yes I was supervising, but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape. Even out cats crawl through it. There are not many toys that are this much fun and durable
