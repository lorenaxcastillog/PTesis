 All of these negative reviews should tell you something! I wish I had bought this at Amazon, so I could've seen these reviews first. They are all correct. There is NO 3D effect at all. In fact, wearing the glasses is a viewing obstruction. We could see the pictures better without them. Also, I don't know if it was my imagination or my frustration, but it seemed that wearing the glasses actually gave me a headache! This would be a much better product if they didn't bother to try to make the images 3D. I too have been looking for slides that will fit into this projector. It wouldn't be bad with plain 2D images
