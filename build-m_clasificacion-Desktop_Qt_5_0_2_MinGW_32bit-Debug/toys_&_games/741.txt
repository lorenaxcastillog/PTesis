 Bought this for our 2.5 year old son, it's a bit big for him now, but we figure by age 3 (summer time), it will be just fine. lots of power, and nice features just right for a little guy. Our son likes the removable engine panel in the front and has found it a perfect place to hide toys and the like. Have not had it in the grass or any other areas where the "ultimate traction" claim could be tested, but from what we have seen indoors one could easily believe that this will make a difference. One final note, make sure you check the dimensions on this before ordering. it's very large but we recommend it
