 When this toy is turned on it seriously sounds like an air-raid siren is going off. I can't use my usual trick of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to hear the instructions to play the games. Also, the counting/shape game is confusing. There is a row of shapes with numbers on them, and the game asks the child to, for example, find 3 rectangles. It's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three times, but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8. There's a circle marked with the number 3. The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the "repeat the tone" and "count the villians" games. I'm not sure how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren noise, though, I may try to hide this and get him a leapfrog toy instead
