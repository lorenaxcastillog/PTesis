 THIS TOY WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE THIS A QUALITY PRODUCT. UPON PUTTING THIS TOY TOGETHER, YOU WILL NOTICE THE VERY POOR MAKEMANSHIP COMPARED TO OTHER POLLY PRODUCTS. THE PLAYSET WILL NOT HOLD, THE PARTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO STAY TOGETHER WILL NOT. THE SKILIFT KEEPS FALLING OFF, THE TOWER WILL NOT STAY CONNEFCTED TO THE SKI LIFT, THE FOLD OUT LOUNGE WILL NOT CONNECT TO THE PLAY SET, AND THE CANDLE HOLDER WAS BROKEN WHEN WE OPENED IT ON TOP OF THAT. EVEN ONE OF THE COATS RIPPED RIGHT IN HALF WHEN I GENTLY PULLED IT OFF THE DOLL. THIS TOY IS TRASH. I WISH I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED THE MONEY ON IT OR TIME PUTTING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR. MY DAUGHTER WHO IS SIX SAYS "THIS TOY IS NO FUN, IT WONT STAY TOGETHER" I PLAN ON CALLING MATTEL AND REQUESTING A REFUND/EPLACEMENT TOY DUE TO DEFECTIVE QUALITY
