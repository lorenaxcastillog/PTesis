 This table is great. The assembly was pretty easy. It does require you to drill the nails into the plastic which was a little strange but not hard to do. The table can adjust to have an angle for kids to draw more easily but so far I have never put it on that setting for him (he's a little over 2 years old) because it's not as easy as they make it seem. And when my son wants to draw, there's just no time to mess with the setting. One more thing I want to mention is that we have the table on wood floor, and the bottom is slippery on the wood floor so it slides all over the place. So I had to put some non-skid padding on the feet to make the table stay in place
