 Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward. My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking. At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased. Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm". Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise. Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys. Toy also seemed fairly tough.
