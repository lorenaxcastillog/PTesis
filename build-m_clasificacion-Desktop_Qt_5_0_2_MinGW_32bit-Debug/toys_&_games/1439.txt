 This monitor has so much static! We would always have to move it all over our bedroom just to find a good spot. Sometimes you can hear other babies crying! When it comes through our monitor we can't tell if it is our baby or not! And then to top it off, the cord broke so we ended up having to tape it to the monitor to keep it plugged in. Otherwise it would unplug by itself and we would wake up in the morning to find that it was off! The only good thing about this product are the lights but you can find that on other ones. Don't waste your money.... keep looking
