 My 2 year old daughter (and our 4 & 6 year old neighbors) LOVE this toy! I had it up during my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it! It holds up very well and I have only had to refill it once (and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug). Some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this. It is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes. I would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under. The one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there
