 I have the Pixel Chix Pixel Pets Jammin' Hamster and here's what I say. It's a very nice thing but don't stay in the secret world too long! When you go back there will be cobwebs. Just press the broom and it will go away. TIP ALERT: When you go up a level, after you see the code, press the checkmark and you will go up another level and get another code! You can even do it again and go on the last level! (Hold down all the bottons on the side with 3 bottons in normal mode and it shows your hamster's litter! Don't forget to name your hamster! I named mine Hammiella/Ella. NO STEALING MY HAMSTER'S NAME OR ELSE!!!!!!! They should move the hamster drinking up to the wheel floor thingy. OVERALL: 4 stars Out
