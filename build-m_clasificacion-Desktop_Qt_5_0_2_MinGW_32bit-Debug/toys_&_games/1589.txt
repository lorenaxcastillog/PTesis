 My son received this for his 3rd birthday after seeing the commercial on Nickelodeon and asking for it every time he saw the commercial. It is really neat, actually makes the huge bubbles like on the commercial, and its easy to do. My 3 year old has no problem holding the wand and opening it and letting the wind blow the bubbles out. Be warned though, this is kind of messy. The wand is so long and huge that when you dip it into the container with the bubble solution it drips quite a bit. So adult supervision is needed with the smaller kids. I usually hold the container and let him dip the wand into it. But he loves the toy, and he loves chasing the bubbles. Haven't run out of solution yet, as its been only a few weeks, but will probably just make our own when it runs out. Overall I think this is a good toy to get the kids up and out of the house, which kids need more of today. And its inexpensive, and fun for the whole family
