 I bought one of these for myself (just for fun) but the two wheels were quickly taken over by my 6 and 9 year old kids. There is only one set of four motions required to make all the brackets (the pattern is set by the initial ordering of the threads, and the wheels are color-coded to help you set up 4 different, very cute patterns: hearts, flowers, diamonds, and a four color barber-pole stripe) With a little tutoring even my 6-year old was able to produce bracelets as long as I was there to provide the occasional reminder. The bracelets take a while to produce so the child you purchase this for should have a good attention span, but the end product is very nice. I'm buying one for my little girl's friend. I hope she likes it as well as my kids do. Now I just need to get another for me
