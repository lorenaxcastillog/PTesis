 Not exactly sure why the recommended age is over 3 years old. My son is 10 months old and as long as your child is playing with the tunnel under supervision there is no reason that they cannot use this product sooner. Love the fact that it slinks up so compact when not in use and for travel. My son will play peek-a-boo and then crawl through the tunnel to come get me on the other side. He can also sit up inside the tunnel without a problem being that he is still younger. He did get mad however, at the fact that he tried to stand up inside the tunnel and could not, guess we will have to get him the tent that attches. Which brings on another good point, this product can be fit to many other products for increased fun (tent, another tunnel, etc.). Leads itself to many options. Would recommend
