 First, I just love Little People toys!! Fisher Price has made a great beginner dollhouse with this toy! My daughter received it for her first birthday. She loves to move the people and enjoys making sounds with the house. She still plays with it occasionally at 18 months. I definitely think this is a 1st dollhouse - it doesn't have many pieces and there aren't many rooms. This is great for a 1-year old, but I purchased "My First Dollhouse" for my daughter for Christmas as a step up. So, if you're looking for longevity, I'd look into the other dollhouses FP makes. But, for younger children, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed with this one
