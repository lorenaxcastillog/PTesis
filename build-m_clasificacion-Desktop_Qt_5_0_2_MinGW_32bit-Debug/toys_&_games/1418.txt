 I got this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter. She loves her dolls. She likes to give rides to her chihahua and her baby dolls. It is a nice and big stroller that I think she will get years of use with it. It has nice big tires that go smoothly through long grass. The tires are white though. But easily cleaned with a sponge. I like that we can easily fold it when we take it with us in the car. Since it so roomy I have to remind her to only use it for her toys, not friends. It has not happened. But I am worried about it. The frame is sturdy but it is not meant to support a childs weight. Over all we are very pleased with it
