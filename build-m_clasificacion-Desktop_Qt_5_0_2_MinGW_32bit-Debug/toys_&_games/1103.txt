 We are big fans of the Little Touch books as a way for us to sit with our little guy and look at the pictures. (He is 10 months now, but we started with this book at 6 months.) We like several of the books, but the sounds and messages of this Pooh Bear book are delightful. We often shut off the story and just use the pictures and sounds to talk to the baby. It is a very engaging way to calm him and share a quiet time. It is not a substitute for reading to the him, but it is a fun additional activity.
