 I got this with spare money for me and my brother and my older parents. I only played it a few times, but it was worth the money. Some rounds are fun and challenging while others are fun and easy. Usually the last round, the bonus round, is the easiest. It doesn't have to be 10+. My brother was 8 and he had no problem playing with it. It's lots of fun for the whole family, ages young and old. My aunt has it too, and because she's so obsessed with wheel of fortune, she wouldn't share it with us! So we took the advantage and bought it. Boy, have the TV plug in video game people made a great hit with this! It's truly one of a kind! I also like to be childish and constantly spin the wheel on the controller even when the game hasn't been turned on :) But now, at this second, I am trying to get it on. It's not turning on...could this be the end of my game? Maybe...I might have to check the batteries. Ok? Now, I must be on my way..
