 first of all, it's not a toy, it's a hobby plane and i agree with the people who say it's not for 10 year olds. every one who wrote a bad review was either too impatient to fly it and didn't read the instructions which say it is a pro level plane and to fly it, you need to read the instructions or you'l regret it or they're just not good pilots. my experience with the storm launcher was excelent. you need to drive it on the ground the first 8- 10 times so the motors can get used to it. then, before flying, you need to do some small jumps for practice. before you know it, you can fly it for almost 6 minutes and do loops.
