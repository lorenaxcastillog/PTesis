 I purchased this product as a Christmas gift and it was greatly appreciated. I give it five stars (actually a suggestion from my granddaughter for whom it was purchased), but I am a little disappointed that it did not come with a stylus. Prior to purchase I had phoned customer service to make sure that it did come with the stylus and was assured it did. Unfortunately that was not the case. It was too late for me to return the item and choose one with a stylus as it was very close to Christmas. However, it is always enjoyed by my granddaughter
