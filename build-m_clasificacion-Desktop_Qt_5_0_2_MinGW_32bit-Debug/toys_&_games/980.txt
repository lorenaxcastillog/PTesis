 i don't have this doll, but just from looking at her picture, i can see that she looks a lot like lindsay lohan! A while ago, i got the mary-Kate and Ashley dolls and they didn't look anything like the real people! But, lindsay lohan so totally does! I like it how they added a new character to the my scene goes hollywood dolls, because it was always the same girls! So I think this doll makes this whole my scene goes hollywood gang a whole lot more interesting! The doll has awesome clothes and fab hair!(i'm really into the hair. lol). I really want to get her(and club birthday chelsea)for my birthday! Sicily #2 my scene fan P.S. If any one knows where i can get club birthday chelsea that would be great
