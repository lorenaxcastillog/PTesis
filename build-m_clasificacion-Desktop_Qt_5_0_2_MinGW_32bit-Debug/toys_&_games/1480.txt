 I went to a well-attended game night (20+ people) where the majority of people were playing the mainstream games that I love: Scrabble, Taboo, Cranium. However, one one of the attendees, a math professor, brought the game Ingenuous with her. Although the game didn't look that fun, a few of us decided we would give it a try because she really wanted to play. Well, it turns out that it is a fantastic game with a lot of strategy. The endgame, it turns out, is VERY important; strategizing how one will approach the endgame becomes very important about half-way through the game, as one sees how the board is starting to take shape. I liken it to Pente and Go: the rules are simple, but strategy is key to winning. The game became a hit at the party with people that loved strategy, and was played in 3- and 4-person format all night long
