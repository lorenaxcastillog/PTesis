 I was rather disappointed with both Doll TV and the item. The coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic. I have toddler toys made of the same material. The packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible. I was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs $25.00. When I contaced Doll TV to discuss the item, I was told that this was "an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie" and that they would refund my shipping costs if I removed my comments. I didn't even pay for shipping!
