 My two year old son fell in love with parachutes during his Gymboree play classes. After just a few weeks, I decided that I needed one for home so we could continue the fun there and invite the neighborhood children to join in. All kids love parachutes and there is so much you can do with them. He loves being dragged around the house in it, hiding under it, using it to send one of his teddy bears flying through the air and making it go up and down with the other kids. The only reason that this product receives three stars is that it was smaller than I expected. The product dimensions are clearly stated but I had difficulty transferring those dimensions into how it would work. It is difficult for the kids to run under the parachute because it is so small. Very good for the price but I will need to buy a larger one
