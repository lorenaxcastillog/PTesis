 I have a 5 year old son and he loves books and being read to. I can't devote all of my time to reading to him... don't get me wrong I still do every day but TJ is my BIG helper. While I am cooking dinner or cleaning house my son can listen to stories and I have my hands free BUT best of all we are still getting storytime together and he loves it. As for the speech comment made in one review I look at it as TJ is supposed to be 5 years old. I personally think it adds a little something special to the toy
