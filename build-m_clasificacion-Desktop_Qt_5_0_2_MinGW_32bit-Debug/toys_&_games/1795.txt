 NECA continues to get very cool licenses for their movie figures, and have continued where McFarlane started. In fact I prefer their figures to the McFarlane ones. However they do have some problems. Sometimes their figures won't stand up. Such as this one. The only way to get him to stand is to lean him up against the wall. The design for this figure has his feet positioned at a weird angle. In fact the whole stance of the figure looks off. Pushing a button on the back of the figure will play the Freddy jump rope song. Yes, thats cool, but it is a pain to to activate due to the fact you have to lean this figure against a wall. It also comes with an optional demon head, which you can replace the Freddy head with. Honestly, if you want a large Freddy figure to display, track down the older McFarlane one. You will pay a lot more, but it is a lot better sculpt than this one and it is based on a better Nightmare film (Nightmare part 1). That or just buy the 7" figure that NECA recently re-released
