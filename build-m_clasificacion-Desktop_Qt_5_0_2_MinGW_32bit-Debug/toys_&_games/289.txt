 We bought this toy for our 1 year old son. It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great. I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well. My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder. Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs. The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle. My son fell over with it and crashed on his face. There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over. My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!
