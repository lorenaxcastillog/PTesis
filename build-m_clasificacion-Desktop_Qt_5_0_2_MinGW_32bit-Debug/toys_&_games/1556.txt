 I got this tricycle for my nephew for his second birthday. Although it may be a little beyond him, he was still dazzled by it. The seat is comfortable enough for them to stay on it and is adjustable. Assembly is pretty straight forward and simple. I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple parts that seemed a little flimsy. The rear step is press formed and a little thin. The same process was used for the seat. Another minor defect was that the seat wasn't perfectly square to the body. Since the adjustable rod for the seat is squared, when you tighten the set screw, it forces it to that offcenter point. Something I noticed, but it's not dramatic and certainly wouldn't affect the ridability. A fun toy for a toddler in your life
