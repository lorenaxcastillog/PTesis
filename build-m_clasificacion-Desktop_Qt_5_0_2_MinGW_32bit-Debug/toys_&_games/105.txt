 After the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy. Unfortunately, one of the key features the toy promises, setting your own secret code/combination to open the safe does not function. Neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose. He was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail, would not return it. Since it arrived at my home I have researched other reviews at Amazon. You already have product reviews stating the same complaint. This is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised. It should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed. As it stands Amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed.
