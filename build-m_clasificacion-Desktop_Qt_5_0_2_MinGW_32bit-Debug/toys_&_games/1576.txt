 I am looking forward to 20 years time when I can have a baby and this is cool for practicing. Mummy doll is Midge but I call her Barbie! It comes with alot of accessories for the baby, not just furniture. The baby goes in the bouncer, or Barbie can cradle her/him. This is good practice but the pieces are VERY small and could get lost or be swallowed. But Barbie is a responsible mother and won't let her baby be lost or swallowed so the baby is nice and chubby. There is a cot with pink canopy for when baby gets tired and when baby gets hungry there is a bottle and some nappies and everything you need... including a purple rattle! Bye
