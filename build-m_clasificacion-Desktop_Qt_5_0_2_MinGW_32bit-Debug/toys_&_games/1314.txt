 I bought this as an early Christmas present for myself. It sounded like a lot of responsibility, but I figured I could handle it. I did everything exactly as the instruction booklet said. I even read up on CPs...books and websites. I put the dome in the fridge for 2 months and on a nice windowsill with light after that. After about 2 and a half months on the windowsill I got a sprout. It was so tiny I couldn't tell which type of CP it was. Like a true geek I looked at the little sprout everyday in aww. I am a bit clumsy. One day I accidently knocked the dome over. My little sprout eventually withered away. I don't think anything will grow from it again because of the shock. I am definitely trying again though. Its worth the wait. I loved my CP sprout. May he/she rest in peace
