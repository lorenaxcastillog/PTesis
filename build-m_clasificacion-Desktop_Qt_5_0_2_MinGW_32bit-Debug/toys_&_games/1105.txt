 i bought this toy for my daughter when she was 5 weeks old. by the next day, she had learned to turn the music on by herself (you spin the center wheel pretty hard), and would do so whenever she woke up in the night. by the end of the week she was sleeping through the night, and i think this toy had a lot to do with it, as it helps her put herself back to sleep without needing me to come soothe her. there are 3 sound functions: talking, music and constant music. we put the talking on for play time and the music at night. at 10 weeks old, she is starting to get big enough to reach the other toys with her feet if i lay her the short way in her crib, but for now her main interest is the wheel that plays music. this is seriously the best money we've spent on baby things
