 When I saw this toy at ToysRus, I thought the concept was really cute. My 3 year old completely wore out his magna doodles, so he got this a few days ago for Christmas. I was really disappointed because the erasing takes at least 15 strikes back and forth, and even then it does not clear the board completely. The concept was good, it's kind of like an overhead projector and the little disc that you can trace. Crayola has been around for many, many years. I thought with the name and their history for putting out good items for kids who love to draw, they really missed the mark on this one. If they had done a little more research, this product could have been great. I am really disappointed
