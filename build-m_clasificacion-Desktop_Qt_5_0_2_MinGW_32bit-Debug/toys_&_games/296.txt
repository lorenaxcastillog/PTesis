 My 6 yr old loves this game of War. The food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who. Besides the plankton, shrimp, little fish, big fish and Shark, there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement. The game is played like war, but the instructions add a slap Jack element. This is not my favorite part. We have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card, which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children. The ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person. This game can go on and on, don't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated. The cards are made well.
