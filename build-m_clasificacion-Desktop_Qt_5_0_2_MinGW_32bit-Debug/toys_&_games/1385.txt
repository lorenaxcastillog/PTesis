 I originally purchased the puzzle for my 12 year old daughter but the whole family eventually put it together. In this case ignorance isn't just bliss, it is also fun. Our family was shocked how little geography we knew. This puzzle turned out to be like two separate games. First, we tried separating the pieces by continent (which we did very poorly). And then we put it together. It was fun finding out how far off we were at times. Everyone was shocked how many countries we had never heard of or couldn't even place in the right continent! Overall it was a great learning experience for the whole family. I recommend this product. It is well-designed, pretty and fun to put together.
