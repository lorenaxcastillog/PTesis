 I PURCHASED THIS SNAKE FOR MY SON'S 6TH BIRTHDAY. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ITEM. FOR STARTERS, THE SNAKE DOES NOT MOVE VERY EASILY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ONLY ON HARDWOOD, AND EVEN THEN, IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS A VERY LONG ANTENNA, WHICH THE KIDS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH. IT IS UNUSUALLY LONG FOR SUCH A SMALL REMOTE TOY! ALSO, THE SECOND NIGHT HE HAD IT, THE SNAKE BROKE. WE ALREADY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE LAST JOINT OF THE SNAKE COMING OFF. THAT IS NOT A BIG DEAL, IT SNAPS BACK IN. BUT AS HE WAS PLAYING WITH THIS SNAKE, IT ACTUALLY CAME APART. NOW, IT IS ONLY HELD TOGETHER BY THE WIRES. MY HUSBAND IS TRYING TO REPAIR IT. I SAW THE TOY BREAK, OUR SON WASN'T BEING ROUGH WITH IT, IT IS JUST VERY VERY POORLY MADE. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY. I FEEL THAT I SHOULD COME UP WITH ANOTHER BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR OUR SON, SINCE THIS ONE BARELY LASTED PAST HIS SPECIAL DAY!
