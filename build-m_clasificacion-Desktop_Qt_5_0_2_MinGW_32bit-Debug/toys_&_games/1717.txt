 We found this to be a great toy. It actually works, unlike the Terrain Twister. The Shell Shocker is durable, goes fast, spins around, opens and closes its fins and goes through just about anything. It actually has power. This is a fun toy. I dont think I would put it through mud or water though. I wouldnt want to have to clean the mud out of it and most of RC type toys dont work well after getting them wet. We chase the dog around the yard with it too, pretty fun. You will need to buy the battery for it and that can cost about $30.00 We've had it 6 months and love it, really cool toy
