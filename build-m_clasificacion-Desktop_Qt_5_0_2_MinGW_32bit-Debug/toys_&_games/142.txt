 My daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside. She thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage. We put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight (56 pounds) but she doesn't seem to bounce very high. And she needs help getting them on. She was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking. I wouldn't tell someone not to buy them but I wish I would have gotten something else for her.
