 I guess some of these other reviewers got this toy for an 18 or 19 month old child... Well my mother bought this for my 8 month old daughter and she has loved it from day one! Out of all the christmas presents she received a few weeks after getting this toy she ONLY plays with THIS toy. We take it in the car, we take it when we're visiting and of course we play with it at home. She absolutely loves it! I guess I can see where the "rudeness" comments come in but for a child this young it still doesn't really matter so maybe you should buy this toy if it is for a younger baby rather than an 18 month old.
