 OKAY WE ALL LOVE THE LITTLEST PET SHOP TOYS & PETS. AND I HAVE SEEN THIS SET BEFORE AND IT IS VERY NICE. BUT PEOPLE PLEASE!!!!! DO NOT PAY THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR THIS ITEM!!!!! GO TO TOYS R US AND BUY IT THERE INSTEAD. JNL TRADING INFLATES ALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!! OF THEIR PRICES! I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GET PEOPLE TO PAY SUCH RIDICULOUS PRICES. LIKE THE LITTLEST PET SHOP TWIN PANDA BEARS SET THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL FOR $40.00 EACH!! I JUST BOUGHT 5!!!!! OF THEM FROM TOYS R US FOR ONLY $3.99 A SET! GET REAL JNL!!!!!!! I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF ANYONE! IS STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY YOUR OUTRAGEOUS ASKING PRICES. SHOP AROUND PEOPLE. THEIR ARE MUCH!!!!!! BETTER DEALS OUT THERE!!!!!! UNSCRUPULOUS SELLERS LIKE THIS (JNL TRADING) SHOULD BE RUN PUT OF BUSINESS. AND I HOPE THAT THEY DO!!!!!! ANYONE THAT'S MY 2 CENTS WORTH. AND YOU GOT IT FOR FREE!!!! WELL ANYWAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE. AND DON'T GET SUCKERED THIS YEAR!!!!! GOD BLESS!!!!
