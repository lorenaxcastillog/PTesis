 My daughter got this set for her first birthday. All the kids enjoyed playing in it, and it held up extremely well. It appears to be very heavy-duty, ready for years of wear and tear. The only flaw I see, compared to other sets, is that the tunnels do not attach to the center section - they just fit inside the openings. This makes for easy set up, but they also come apart too easily, making the center collapse. One rambunctious youngster made a game of tearing the set apart. And when my toddler falls against either the center or a tunnel, they become disconnected. If I hadn't already destroyed the packaging, I'd return it for a set that uses velcro (like Playhut) to attach the tunnels and tents
