 this thing is the cheatest thing ive ever seen in my life. it takes for ever to assemble it and then the cheap plastic is the worst of its kind!!! a WWE wrestler would have troble stirring it. you need stuff from home like vandillinium and rubidum just to make an ounce of the stuipid ice cream that tastes like something that was scraped of the underside of a boot!!!! when we finnialy got it all craned out, we only got a spoonful and it was a orange color so i didnt try it. plus, you can only make it 2 times before you have to burn more money to buy refills. DO NOT BUY IT IS A PEICE OF JUNK YOU SHOULD WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A BOOK TITLED THE HISTORY OF JUNK AND BORING SCIENCE. IT WOULD BE ALOT BETTER THAN THE CHEAP JUNK THAT MCDONALDS IS TRYING TO SELL JUST BECAUSE THEY ARENT DONING SO GOOD IN THE BURGER BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
