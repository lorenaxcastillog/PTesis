 This Eeyore is so much fun. I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY." Just precious. Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle. I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work. Nana Ka
