 My daughter received Annika, Brietta the Pegasus, and The Magical Cloud Kingdom for Christmas. The wings will NOT stay on the Pegasus, but is otherwise very much enjoyed and my daughter really loves her Annika doll. However... in good conscience I must say if you are thinking of the Magical Cloud Kingdom (for which we paid an astonishing $50) save your money!! What a waste. I'm disappointed it isn't being sold here so I could get the word out. With any luck it isn't being sold anymore due to poor reviews. It took awhile to set up, but it is so flimsy! The beautiful cloud background was completely unusable within 4 hours of play on Christmas day and I kept having to reassemble it every 10 minutes. Parts were constantly leaning and falling over (and apart). For the amount of money we paid I would have expected to get a toy at least 1/2 the quality of this one. What it basically comes down to is my 5 year old daughters most requested Christmas gift won't last as long as the candy in her stocking
