 We bought the game thinking it would be just like the real life game, but with sponge Bob characters. It is a very simplified version of the game. It is geared towards young children. In the game, if you run out of money, you just keep playing, and you are exempt from having to pay any fees, while the people with money, still keep paying...so you are actually better off if you lose your money early in the game. (that bugs me) as far as the spinner goes...it snaps on, you have to press hard to get it to click into place, and it works great. Just a little disappointed, just remember, it's for little kids. If you love the game of life, get the original one...my older kids want me to buy the original one, they don't care for the sponge bob version.
