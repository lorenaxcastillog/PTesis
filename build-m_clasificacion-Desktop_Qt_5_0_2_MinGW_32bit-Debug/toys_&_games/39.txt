 This game is heavily developed based on the actual movie. If you haven't seen the movie, and/or your kid was too young to understand the plot, then they might not get the game. Most of the adventures are based on the story plot. A lot of the adventures are a bit dumb, like McQueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck, McQueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings, McQueen herding the tractors back into the pen, McQueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes, McQueen driving down a road looking for Mack based on memory, McQueen dodging the firetruck water blast, etc. The only adventure I liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers (odd vs. even) and installing them on the race car. Don't buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with Cars
