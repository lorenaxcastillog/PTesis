 After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be. I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close. The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered. This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head. Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward. It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up. It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales. This replica is not comparable to the original
