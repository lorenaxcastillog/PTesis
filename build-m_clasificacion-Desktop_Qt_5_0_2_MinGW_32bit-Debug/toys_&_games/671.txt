 My almost 6-year-old son loves drawing and coloring, and this special set is perfect for him. In addition to having *100 different colors* (!) the markers are small with a thin tip. They fit his hands well and he loves having so many colors to choose from. We have had this set for several months and none have dried out or given him any problems. The case is perfect. It is sturdy plastic, snaps shut and has a handle. These are more "grown up" than the Crayola markers and have a much finer tip than even their skinny ones, so they are great for words and small details. We love this set
