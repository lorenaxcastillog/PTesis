 Purchased the Radio Flyer little red wagon for my two year son for Christmas. We all love it! It is perfect for all our needs. Our son pulls his stuffed animals, toys, dirt, rocks around with ease. I appreciate the steering and the turning radius on the wagon, it enable our son to maneuver the wagon on this own. As we all know this is very important to two year olds! Mom and Dad love it for haul the child on longer walks, were we can pick up the pace and get in dome exercise. It also makes running errands around the neighborhood great! The wagon is large enough for our son and two bags of groceries. We live in the rainy Northwest and have on occasion left the wagon out side, no rust or water damage. There is a reason this wagon is a classic! Note: I would also purchase the pad as well.
