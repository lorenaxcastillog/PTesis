 Our 3+ toddler LOVES Cinderella, so this was under the tree this past Christmas. Though the fancy shoes fell off immediately (I hid them since they pose a choking hazard to our 2 year old) the doll has withstood the tough toddler test of time since December. Press the small button on her back, and the dress will sparkle and light up while playing the song, A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES" (quite LOUDLY I must add)! The doll is a beautiful likeness of the beloved Disney princess, but her hair is so stiff it doesn't welcome children to play with it, the dress does not come off, another NO-NO with little ones, and since the wand is a pointy piece of plastic, it went the way of the shoes to avoid a poking and/or choking hazard. Though the box states for ages 3 and up, I'd recommend this one more for 5+ and even more so for the doll collector since the dress is so unique and well made. It comes in a pretty box too. Overall a really nice doll
