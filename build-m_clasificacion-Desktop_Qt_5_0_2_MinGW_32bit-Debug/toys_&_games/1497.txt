 I love TY Digits. He is an incredibly adorable and huggable stuffed monkey. He makes a great present for any young child (or stuffed animal-loving adult). I have yet to come across a child or anyone for that matter, who sees him and doesn't want to immediately touch him or hold him. His hair is very soft. Make sure you do no machine wash him (follow the care instructions) or else his hair will knot up and become nappy causing him to look thin and malnourished. I have had this happened to the first Digits that I purchased (I own three). In my opinion, Ty Digits is by far the best animal in the entire TY Collection. A close second is Dangles of the Ty Pluffies Collection.
