 My 2 year old loves this puzzle. It is durable enough for a toddler - it has been a month and none of the pieces has shown any signs of wear-n-tear. Putting it together with your child is quality time well spent. It took about a week for my child to assemble this all by herself - and I was very proud when I saw it the first time. The pictures are plain, not cute, but good enough for my child to recognize what they reference. Due to the length of the puzzle (assembled in one big line), you'll need a lot of space if you want to assemble it as a train - need about 10 ft of space. Overall, I would recommend this as the 1st puzzle for a toddler.
