 Hey -- I've never played this 'card-based' version, but I've played the electronic version many, many times. It's just one gadget that displays the word and is the timer. You pass the gadget when your team guesses correctly. the team who is left holding the gadget when the timer goes loses. It even keeps track of the score. For those of you who have exhausted the cards and don't want to keep buying more might find the electronic version to your liking. (Just search 'catch phrase' here on Amazon). Regardless, this game is alot of fun and really easy to teach new players how to play.
