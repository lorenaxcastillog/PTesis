 We purchased this game for my just-turned 5-year-old. He loves to play both levels. His almost 4-year-old friend enjoys limited play, and a 2-year-old loves just looking at the cards, calling out the letters, and playing with the plastic figures. A couple of the letter sounds are very similar, but it is teaching Alec to listen carefully and not get discouraged if he gets an answer wrong the first time. It is also nice that there is no one "winner." Anyone who reaches the "winners" square is a winner. My son sometimes just randomly calls out letters and the sounds they make. Very good for getting him ready for school in a few months
