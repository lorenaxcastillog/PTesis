 My 2 1/2 year old daughter received these from Santa and they have been a big hit! The first night she jumped in the tub and immediatly started making all the car and truck noises and putting them on the road. They foster great vocabulary skills when you can talk about all the different types of vehicles and transportation. What I especially like is the colors. It is hard to find cars and trucks that aren't the traditional red and blue. They are more girl friendly without being too "girly" for little boys. They are very sturdy and store easily in the mesh bag provided. The only downfall is there could be more road pieces. Otherwise, a great tub toy
