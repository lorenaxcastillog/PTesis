 I was nervous about this after reading a few reviews on this and some other toys simular to this one. My son has had alot of fun with his other figurines ( Star Wars, Batman, Dinosaurs, etc) hanging out with the Turtles in the lair! Dora has even made a visit. My son gets frustrated easily so I was concerned about the durability. It' just fine! We dont close it up, it stays open in his room and it travels all over the house. It has been alot of fun for my son! I am glad that I chose this Lair over the Batman cave
