 My 2 yr old got this dinosaur and the Imaginext Mammoth for Christmas. While his 3yr old brother got the Brontosaurus and T-Rex. I really like this one for the little ones. All the other dinosuars come with a saddle for the little men to ride in. The saddles pop off very easily and I like that we don't have the hassle with this one. Also it comes with less little accessories pieces which my 2yr old is not intested in anway. I've seen that Fisher price has come out with a new line of these dinosaurs that now walk too. I have to say that as cool as those are I still prefer this line. These are very durable for rough little kids and I just know my boys would break the walking mechanism in the new ones
