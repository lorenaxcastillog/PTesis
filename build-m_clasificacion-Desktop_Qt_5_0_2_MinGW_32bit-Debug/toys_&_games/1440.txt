 My sister in law has a gift for choosing unique toys and books for my kids, and this sushi set tops the list. She chose this for my son's second birthday, and he loves it! His three and a half year old brother and seven year old sister have also been playing with it a lot. They spend so much time "making sushi," selling it to each other, and eating it. The accessories like the knife and chopsticks are great, and the velcro for assembling the sushi is a brilliant idea. Most kids love to play with pretend food, but pretend sushi is just so cool. The box the set comes in is great, not only for storage but because it's so cute. Even if you don't care for sushi, you'll love this toy and so will your kids!
