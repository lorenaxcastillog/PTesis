 My daughter (4) absolutely loves this train. We've had it about a year, and I found her sleeping with it the other night. The sounds are great, and she likes that it moves bacwards and forwards (although it needs help mastering steep hills). My complaint is that ours sucks the life out of batteries EXTREMELY quickly...it doesn't seem normal. I don't know if its just ours or if all of them work in the same way, but most of the time the batteries are dead and she just plays happily with it making her own noise. If I had to do it over I would consider the one without batteries -- I really think she would have loved it just as much. However, she is overjoyed when I put in fresh batteries and quickly wears them out again
