 "Customers who bought this item also bought ...". That's the bit that is easily overlooked when one orders that item. Once the toy arrives you will be surprised to know that a number of accessories are also needed. It takes a lot of time to finding some, and a lot more creative thinking for others (gravel!). And then this compound starts getting highly educational as you have to teach the child to handle his/her birthday present the way a nurse would normally deal with patients under intensive care. The whole thing is a little disappointing overall. An actual comment about this item was nothing les than "this package sure is nice". Maybe the idea is interesting, but will offer more headaches than fun to your family
