 This game is my new favorite board game. We love "Scene It" TV edition, and one of our favorite categories ask questions about commercials and ad jingles. So, of course we were thrilled when we found this game. Basically how to play: you are given an ad slogan or jingle, or mascot and you have to name the product. The object is to climb the "ladder" in an ad agency. Some of the cards are very easy, and some are hard. There are very new ad campaigns and "classic" ones. There are even super bowl ads. We have played it so much since Christmas, that we know alot of the answers, so we need them to come out with sequel cards, like the "Scene It" company did. I think this game would be especially fun when entertaining guests. We've played twice with guests, and both groups enjoyed it
