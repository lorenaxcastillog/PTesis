 My 4 year old son loves these, he really loves the books and magic markers. I love it because my two year old daughter can not mark up the walls, chairs, sofa, floor or anything else. My major issue is my son will grind the markers to the stump and finish the book in about ten minutes flat. At $7 or $8 dollars a pop, it's way too expensive for me. I think it's a great concept and my son loves to see that he can "draw in the lines", it's a real confidence booster. But for now, it's a sometime activity and we'll stick with the washable crayons and regular ol' coloring books for everyday
