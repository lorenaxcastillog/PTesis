 I was labelled as gifted and talented as a child, and am big into games that are truely stimulating. I bought this game for my 11 year old brother for Christmas. I received it yesterday in the mail and was so excited about it, I had to open it. My husband (who doesn't like to play games!) and I played it all night! We would have contests to see who could "beat" the next level! Now I'll have to get another one for my brother, because we are kepping this one! A couple of them really stumped me for a while, but after enough staring at it, I would figure it out. I love games like these, my parents used to get me games like this when I was younger. Set, is one of my favorites. The mensa website has a lot of recommendations for games to challenge you. I am such a huge advocate of educational games like these!
