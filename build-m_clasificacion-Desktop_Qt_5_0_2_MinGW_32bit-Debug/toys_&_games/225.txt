 After returning three defective Tonka Hands On Power Shovels, (aka crane,) we decided to try a different piece of machinery and brought home the dump truck. So far the dump truck is doing fine. It is not as exciting as the crane or digger, but it does work and seems to be holding up. My son loves to turn it on &amp; have it &quot;follow&quot; him around the room. However the motor strains, and the truck moves very slowly, so I'm concerned that the load is too much for the motor. He likes the loading action of the front end shovel into the dump bed, and the dumping bed. He was disappointed that it doesn't steer like the crane did, but only goes either forward or reverse. But a working toy is better than an non-working toy, and I'm hopeful this one will be a keeper
