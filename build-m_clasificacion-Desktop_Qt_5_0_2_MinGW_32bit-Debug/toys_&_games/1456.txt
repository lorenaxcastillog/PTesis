 This was bought for our son when he was 6 months old by a friend who swore by crib soothers. I would not have bought it on my own but thought we would give it a chance. It is amazing. Our son loves it! We take it on vacation and it helps with the transition. It has been used every night for a year and it hasnt broke. The batteries need to be changed about once a week and it acts broken when it needs new ones, so make sure to check that before you assume it is broken. Pros: It has a good variety of songs and sounds It is cute Good volume adjustment Can change to go off after 3,5 or 10 minutes easy for baby to operate Helps babies relax and get to sleep Cons: Goes through batteries quickly Says "I love you" and it seems creep
