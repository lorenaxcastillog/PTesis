 My son is too old for the Brio/Thomas trains although at one time they consumed his every waking moment. He is not quite ready (nor am I) for the various scaled electic trains. He has always been a Lego fan so when he saw this he jumped. The train itself is really well designed with nearly perfect instructions. It is reminiscent of the hi-speed trains (TGV) in Europe. The track goes together easily and precisely. It seems to be durable enough to handle many assembly cycles. The neatest aspect of the system is the IR control. The train is powered locally, not from energized track. The speed and direction are controlled via an infrared controller. The trains maximum speed seems well matched with the curvature of the track so my son was able to run full speed through the turns without derailing. Top speed is really fast! My only negative comment is that it came with just enough track to build an oval. I would been happy to spend a little more money and receive enough track to be creative. We had to wait a week for the track expansion kit to arrive. Great train, great service.
