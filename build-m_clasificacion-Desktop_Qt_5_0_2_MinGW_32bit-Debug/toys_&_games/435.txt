 This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set. It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain. The set includes the following: 4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together) 2 curves 2 short straights 2 guard rails 2 end ramps 8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each) The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned. The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed. The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down). You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups. This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set. Lots of fun. The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past. Definitely fun.
