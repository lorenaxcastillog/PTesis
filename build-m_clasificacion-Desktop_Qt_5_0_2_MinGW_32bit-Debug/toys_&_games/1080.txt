 My daughter recieved an easy bake oven for Christmas. I had fond memories of mine in the sixties. But I remember being able to eat the food I made. We have tried a lot of receipes. The mac and cheese was disgusting, my daughter could not eat it. The "pizza" was disgusting, we had to add our own ketchup, the cake mix did not rise one iota and had to be scraped out of the pan.The brownie mix did not rise and also had to be scraped out of the pan. The descriptions of the food and picture on the very expensive packets are misleading and false advertising. From the size of the barbie size portion to the appearance of the food even when following the directions exactly. Horrible. I cringe every time my daughter wants to take it out to use. Don't waste your money, time or electricity.
