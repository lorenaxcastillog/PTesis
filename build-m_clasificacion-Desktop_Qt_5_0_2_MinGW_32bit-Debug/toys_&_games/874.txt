 It took several tries before I realized the "trick" to setting this game up more quickly. The branches enter one side of the hive and exit through a hole on the other side. At first, I found it frustrating to get all of the leaves through the exit holes. Then I realized that once you've inserted a dozen leaves or so, the rest don't have to exit. Then can just be popped in quickly and find support on the properly inserted brances. I didn't think the directions were as clear as they should have been. I definitley fell prey to the "award winning" sticker on the box when I bought this game. However, the more we play it, the more I see the educational value in it. My 3 year old is simply thrilled to learn turn-taking as we try to make the bees fall out. My 7 and 9 year olds are definitely more into the logic and competition of the game. All told, once you've mastered the branch issue, it's really a fun game and worth the space on your family game shelves
