 Yo Brannan, Relinquished does not fuse to or more monsters. It lets you equip oppontents monsters to it. Learn Yugioh you... error!!! My favorite cards in pegasus deck are toon world, relinguished, and blue eyes toon dragon. I gave the durability 2 stars because when you leave your cards in the sun in the car, they get in bad cond. You know that annoying snap action. The only thing i don't like like about pegasus deck is that theres not that many high attack monsters. I would reccomed deck protecters. Also buy a kaiba evolution for megamorph. In pegasus deck use seven tools of the bandit you lose 1000 LP. Then use Toon World. You lose another 1000 LP. Special Summon Blue Eyes Toon Dragon. Then use Megamorph. 6000 LP for your Toon Dragon. Then use Toon Special ability. Your opponent losses 6000 LP and he/she probobly will lose. Lose 2000 LP with Seven Tools! Megamorph is worth it!!!! Hope my review was helpful. P.S. Brannan this is a good review.
