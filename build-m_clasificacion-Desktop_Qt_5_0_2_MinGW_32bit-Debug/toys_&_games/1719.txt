 My [...] year old loves this! He zooms around on it fast. I also had a problem with the pedal falling off. My husband hammered it in good and now it doesn't fall off. The seat on ours broke too. My son only had it a couple weeks when this happened. He still loves it and rides around on it. He took the seat off and rode it like that a lot before the seat broke. I have to go buy a replacement seat. Overall I think it's still a fun thing for the kids. My [...] year old likes to ride his brothers big wheel too.
