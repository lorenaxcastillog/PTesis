 This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY! My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it. After all, it IS a ball! We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors! We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time. So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time. I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work. It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use. She never played with this toy as a crawling infant. She only plays with it now, and she only throws it. Please don't waste your money on this toy. It's not worth it
