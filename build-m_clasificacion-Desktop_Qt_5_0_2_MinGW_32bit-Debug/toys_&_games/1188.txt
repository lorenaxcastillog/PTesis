 I bought this jeep for my 3 year old daughter's birthday. We are seeing the same problem as another reviewer - that she is not heavy enough to weigh it down and the wheels spin even on small hills. Also, it seems to jerk her when she first hits the "gas" pedal. However, when her 3 year old cousin is in the jeep with her - (totaling about 60-63 lbs.) it seems to ride a lot better. I suppose weighing it down with something until she gets bigger would help. As for the battery problem - ours is fine so far. She has ridden her jeep for maybe two hours total so far, and I have not recharged the battery yet. Maybe the first reviewer had one that was defective or something. All in all, this toy may be a little old for a three year old (at least mine), but I think she will grow into it. I will update about the battery soon
