 My husband and I got this LEGO set for our 9 year old son, and he absolutely loves it. He is a LEGO nut and had been specifically looking for a LEGO people set so he can interchange the outfits, hairs, etc. to build his own LEGO characters. This set has pretty much every general "character" you can think of...from a pro-skateboarder to a firefighter. This set is also great for kids who enjoy role-play because of the various characters offered in this set. The only thing that caught us a bit off-guard was the size of the box. Based on the price we paid (around $43) we thought the box would be bigger...although there are 200 something LEGO people pieces. I guess we're just used to seeing a bigger LEGO box when we purchase a set for $40. Regardless, we all have enjoyed playing with the LEGO people
