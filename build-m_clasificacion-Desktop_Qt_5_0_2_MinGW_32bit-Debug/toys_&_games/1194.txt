 My 5yr old son LOVES this toy, he has always loved to build things. But as with most educational toys a 5-6yr old needs some guidance. This isn't the kind of toy that you just plop your kid down in front of and walk away (see "playdoh"), they'll just end up hating it. You need to take the time to show them how it works, what they can do with it, and pretty soon they'll get the hang of it, and as a bonus you get to spend quality time with your kid. Everyone talks about quality time vs. quantity time and use it as an excuse to spend less time with their kids. The simple truth is you cannot spend quality time without spending a SIGNIFICANT quantity of time!!
