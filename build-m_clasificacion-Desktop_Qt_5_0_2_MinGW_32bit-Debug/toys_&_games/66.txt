 I bought two of these as Christas gifts. One for my son and one for my nephew. My kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and I are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash. Not only does this stuff look like sand, but it gets into EVERYTHING just like real sand. The play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess. On top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well. All and all I would reccomend this product only for childeren over 8yrs and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up.
