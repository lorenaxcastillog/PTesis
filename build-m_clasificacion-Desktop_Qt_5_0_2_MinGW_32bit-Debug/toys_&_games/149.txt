 Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product. I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products. To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track. Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes. However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off. She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her. Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go. Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it. She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track. Needless to say, it is going back. The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun
