 My 6 year old son wanted this SO badly from Santa. Well, he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of Dec. What was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring, furry annoyance rather quickly. It is cute but there are several things that I (and my son) found wrong with the product. When he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes don't close all the way...kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real! Then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a HORRIBLE grinding noise! My son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken. I explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub. What else are you going to tell a child on Christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer?! Cute toy in theory, not so much in person though. I would not recommend this toy
