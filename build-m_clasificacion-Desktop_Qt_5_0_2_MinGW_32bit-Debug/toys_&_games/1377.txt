 My daughter received this for her third birthday almost a year ago. She LOVES it! I was so excited to be able to get it for her in pink (we also got the matching pink/purple organizer). The microphone is SO fun and the books that come with it are very entertaining. She loves to record her voice and then hear her responses played back within the story. We have purchased several other books for her, some of which do not have the "microphone" feature. She has enjoyed all of them, over and over, although I must admit, the ones with the microphone feature are her favorites. I wish Leapfrog would come out with more of them with that feature. My daughter often takes this in the car with us, and also plays with it at home a lot. It is fun and educational. I love that I can continue to buy new books for it that get more advanced as she gets older. This is a toy she will be able to use and enjoy for many years. I highly recommend it
