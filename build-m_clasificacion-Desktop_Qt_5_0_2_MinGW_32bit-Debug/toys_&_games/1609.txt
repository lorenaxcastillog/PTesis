 If your child likes playing with Thomas and Friends trains, James is another one of the main characters in the series. His 6 wheels are not as big as Gordon's, yet not as small as Thomas', but James is just proud of being who he is: a red steam engine. He pulls a tender full of coal, so he won't run out of fuel like diesels do. James' personality is a little snooty, and he thinks that his jobs are the most important. Eventually, these thoughts will land James in trouble. Rest assured, James will always get his work done, which is why I recommend him for your collection
