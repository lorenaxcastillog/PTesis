 I bought this game hoping to have another great game for my girlfriend and I (we became bored playing backgammon all the time) and we are disappointed. This game has nothing to do with any lost cities.... it's just a card game that requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points... you group the cards by color (which are supposed to represent cities????) and eventually the game ends after a certain number of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers, divide that by pi, and then take the square root of you birth year and multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or need to subtract them. Then you do the math for your partner. We tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb.... (The points arn't that difficult really!), but this game was a waste of time and twenty some odd dollars. I suggest you take the $20 and buy a bottle of hooch, and have some real fun with your partner... unless you are 8 years old... in which case this game might be fun. Just Terrible
