 This set is so delicious you just want to eat it (please don't though!) and it has a million and one uses that are fun, fun, fun. You have ten pots of colorful squishy dough that can be used to make dinosaurs, farm animals, people and even buildings! There's nothing you can make with play-doh, my nephew even made a plate of ham and eggs, well that's what he said it was and I am inclined to believe him! All you need is a plastic sheet, some cookie cutters and a whole heap of imagaination. Remember however that Play-Douh goes hard if you don't put it away after you have finished using it, make sure the lids are sealed tightly if you want it to last. This is a great toy that children and adults can enjoy together, and this set is especially good value as it doesn't cost the earth and it is well packaged. Well worth investing in for those long rainy days that are heading our way
