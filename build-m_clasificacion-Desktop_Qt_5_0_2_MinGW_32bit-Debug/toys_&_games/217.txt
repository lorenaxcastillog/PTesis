 Purchased this for a 3 1/2 year old boy. Was hesitant about buying any large, plastic truck, but we did not see any alternatives at the time we purchased this. We should have stuck with our instinct. When it arrived, we were immediately struck by the fact that the plastic seemed flimsy, and that many small plastic pieces that are attached to the grader appeared and felt so cheap and flimsy that we doubted they would survive 5 minutes of play, in our humble opinion. We were not going to wait to find out, and we decided to send this back. You can get a STEEL Tonka 18" grader off of ebay for less than what Amazon is asking for this plastic thing. That's exactly what we did. Good luck
