 I bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube. I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle. However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off. We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well. The major problem is that these turned out not to be "stickers" after all, but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static. They fall off easily. This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use. Hopefully, Rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle
