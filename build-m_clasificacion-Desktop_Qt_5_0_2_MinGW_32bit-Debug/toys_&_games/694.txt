 I bought a set of tinkertoys for my 6 year old son. Unfortunately, since there are no detailed, step by step isntructions, we found it too frustrating to reproduce some of the elaborate creations pictured on the container. We also broke several pieces in the first few hours. Maybe I'm just spoiled with K'Nex, and the very detailed instructions they come with. Maybe for some kids who just want to use their imagination to build their own creations, this would be a good toy. My son really wanted to build the creations pictured on the container, so this toy did not work for us, so we returned it
