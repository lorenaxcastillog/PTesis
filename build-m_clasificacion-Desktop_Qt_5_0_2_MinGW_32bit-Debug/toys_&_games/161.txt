 I bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year. I was SO wrong. First, as I feared, the water "fishbowl" leaked the 1st time I filled it. I returned it and the next one leaked as well. Then, the mirror is one of those "plastic" mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son. The cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use. Finally, the toy just didn't have that "fun" value that a $43 toy should have. He hated it - never attempted to crawl down it, never played with the features. Save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value. There are tons of better products out there..
