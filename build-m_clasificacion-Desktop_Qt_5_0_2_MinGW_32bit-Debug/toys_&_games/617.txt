 My seven year old daughter says she wants to be a vet, so when we went to spend some birthday money, and she saw this, she fell in love with it. Some of the accessories don't look like any tool I've ever seen at a vet's office, but that hasn't stopped her from finding a use for them--she's really using her imagination with this one. No broken parts in our kit, and it's not getting the most gentle treatment, so maybe I got a new version or something. We also got the 13" (I think) Darby that comes separately, and she says it's the Mommy dog, and "Little Darby" is her baby, who's sick and has to see the vet
