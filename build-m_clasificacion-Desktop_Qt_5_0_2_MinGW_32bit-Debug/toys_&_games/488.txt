 We gave this toy to our son for Christmas when he was 7 months old and he just loved it and still does at almost a 1 year old. It was fun watching his motor skills improve while using this toy. At first he mostly banged the noise making nails and did really grasp the ball dropping, storage compartment, crank or spinning ball. Little by little he added what he could do with this toy. Soon he was able to get the balls out of the compartment and drop them in the bottom hole, then soon in the top hole. He now wails with the little plastic hammer on the nails and just loves it. We haven't had to replace the batteries yet. I highly recommend this toy for developing motor skills
