 My husband and I purchased this toy for our 5 year for christmas. We have an unfinished basement so we let him play this downstairs. (It's too cold to play outside now.) The toy is fun when it actually works. Many times the balls get stuck. It's very frustrating constantly trying to get them to actually pop out. When they do sometimes they are too low to hit. We haven't yet tried to play t-ball with it. It's fairly light so it's possible it may tip over many times. I find that the pieces are pretty durable. My son does continue to play it but he often stops cause it gets frustrating. He sometimes just plays with the balls and bat so it wasn't a total loss
