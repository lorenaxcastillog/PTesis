 i got this toy for my cousin who is 6. he Loves it. of course i had to help him with it, reading the experiments and all but that was ok. it is pretty messy and sticky so having an adult around helps. he didnt like the taste of some of the experiments so we ended up just throwing them away. i also didnt really understand the whole thing about connecting the lab together and stuff. luckily he didnt care about setting it up as he did just making the food. overall it was not a bad toy. just a few hitches
