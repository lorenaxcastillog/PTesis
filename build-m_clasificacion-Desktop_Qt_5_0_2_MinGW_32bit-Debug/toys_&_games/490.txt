 My son received this workshop at about 8 months & still plays with it all the time at 19 months. He mostly enjoys dropping the balls through the chute & cramming things into the overhead compartment. We also bought the Discover Sounds hammer that is sold as an accessory, but it was really too heavy for him to use at first. He still doesn't pay that much attention to it. The light-weight hammer that comes with the workshop is just fine. The workshop is durable also. My daughter sits on the nails, & so far it has held up well
