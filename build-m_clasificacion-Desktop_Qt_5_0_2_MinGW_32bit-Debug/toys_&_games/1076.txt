 I purchased this item for my 4, almost 5 year old. It is way over his head...not surprisingly as it is almost over mine. As stated in another review, this looks more like a rescue vehicle than a firetruck...also...the multiple pieces that come with this toy make it that much more of an advanced toy...not really for a 3 year old. The manufacter recommended age is 36 months to 8 years. I would say more like 6 to 8 years and no less. I almost feel like it is a collectors item that should be sitting on a shelf...so you don't lose it's parts...but I do not think the manufactuer's intended it to be so. Unless your child is a perfectionist and super detailed...this really isn't the toy for them (in my opinion, of course)
