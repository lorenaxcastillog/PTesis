 This puzzle has been through two kids in my house and it's still in great shape. The cardboard is thick and durable. The picture is friendly and interesting. It's been a favorite with my kids. However, if you are buying this puzzle for a two-year old or younger, this puzzle can be very cumbersome to solve simply because the pieces are gigantic. As a small child solves the puzzle, he must basically crawl over it to reach the other parts and that causes the pieces to come apart. The floor puzzles like this one have caused some aggravation with my kids simply because they can't avoid getting on the puzzle to reach sections and that undoes their work. We have found smaller sized pieces to be easier to solve, as long as the fine motor skills allow. Just something to keep in mind..
