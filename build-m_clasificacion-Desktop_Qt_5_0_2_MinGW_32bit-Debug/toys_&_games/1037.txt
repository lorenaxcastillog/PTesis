 I got this for my 10-month old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES it and can't wiat to go to the playroom to play house everyday. I'm pregnant again and ordered this toy in the hopes that once the new baby is old enough to play, the two of them could play together with this fun toy. It's really fun to watch her discover new things every single day. The first time she learned to open the door herself and crawl through it, she must have done it 20 times over and over again. She loves the key, the letters and all of the balls. She's still a little young to understand a lot of the learning activities on this toy. But, I have a feeling she's going to love this for months and months to come. Great toy
