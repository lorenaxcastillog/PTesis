 These cars are so much fun! Just as the name says, you just shake it up and it goes. My son has several of these and they all have slightly different reactions. Some are faster than others. They work best on a hard surface - Cement, hardwood floors, tile. They go pretty slow on carpet. The cars are very durable. One of my son's favorite games is to launch them off the deck and see if he can get it to land on the grass below. If the weather isn't nice, he likes to send them racing down the stairs. So far, nothing has broken and its been over six months. These cars are easy for my daughter (who is only two) to play with too. The kids love shaking with the cars and racing to see who's car goes the farthest.
