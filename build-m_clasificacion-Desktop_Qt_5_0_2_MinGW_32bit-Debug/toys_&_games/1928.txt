 My son came home from his first week of kindergarten speaking about this great timer that his teacher had -- if the timer went off, snack time was over. Period. He seemed so intrigued that I decided I needed to get one. IT IS AWESOME - at least for my two boys (ages 3 & 5). I give them 20 minutes to get out of bed & dressed in the morning and another 20 to eat breakfast. The timer shows GREEN, then turns to YELLOW when time is almost up; then turns RED. You can customize the sound effects for each color; and the amount of time to allow during each color. My kids have responded fabulously to the timer -- and we are always on time for school. I also use it as a sharing timer (if they fight over a toy, I set the timer and they take turns); and use it for play-time (you have X# of minutes to play before dinner, bedtime, etc.)
