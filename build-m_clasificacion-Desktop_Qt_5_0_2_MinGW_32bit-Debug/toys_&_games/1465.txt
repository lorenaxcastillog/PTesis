 Sea-monkeys are cool, and this set is also cool, but to own sea-monkeys, you need to be very serious about it, you need to care for them always, and if you forget to feed them once, or oxygenate them, or even the tiniest thing, they can die, this has happened with my sister and I for the second time, and this time they died after five days! So, I guess before you buy this set, you should be willing to take full responsibility for your little aquatic pets, perhaps make a schedule for feeding, oxygenating, etc. for your pets. Hope this helps
