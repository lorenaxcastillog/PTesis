 We bought this from Amazon for a Christmas gift for our 3 1/2 year old grandson. He had had a similar indoor-tent type toy (not Thomas), but it had broken. Charlie is a big fan of Thomas the Tank, so that played a part, but he played with little else the whole weekend. The toy unfolded rapidly (made Daddy jump) and went together easily. It is large enough for the little guy and his daddy to be in at the same time (Daddy carefully). Once Daddy and Grandpa read the directions, the thing folded easily and neatly back into the shopping-bag size carrier. Mom said it was a much better toy than the old one.
