 I just bought this sandbox for my 2 year old, and was concerned with the reviews stating that it did not keep the water out. When I opened the box, I noticed that the lid design had changed from the design pictured on the box and in the advertisements. This new lid does not fit tightly at all. I would recommend purchasing a bungee cord to strap it on when not in use. The good news is that after a long night of hail, torrential rains(3 inches worth), and 60-70mph winds, the sand was completely dry! I kept the lid on by throwing a waterhose over it right before the storms hit. My daughter absolutley loves this toy and I highly recommend it.
