 My children enjoyed painting the 3 puppies. They were excited that there was many different colors on the paint palette. The paint dried really quick; so they were able to but details on the puppies. I liked the fact it was easy clean up, little supervision and kept them busy for a while. After they completed the painting of the puppies they chose to play with them. The kit came with many creative options(ie. magnets, ornamentsand window decorations). The kit included all these items. It even included varnish for a shiny finish. Which will look nice hanging on my Christmas tree.
