 My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game. She wants to play it constantly. So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily. It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it. There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed. That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach
