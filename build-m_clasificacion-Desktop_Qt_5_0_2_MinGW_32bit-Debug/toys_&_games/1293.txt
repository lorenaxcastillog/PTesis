 This is a phenomenal card game. In a elegant, subtle way Xactika has give you more control of the hand you're dealt than has ever been possible in a bidding card game. One way to think about the cards is that each one has four suites on it, and you can play any one of them. The bidding card tells you the chances of other cards having the suit you chose, so you can decide whether playing it will win or lose the trick for you. You'll want this extra edge since you have to make your bid EXACTLY to get the points you bid. Take advantage of it - it's not what you're dealt, but how you play your cards that will decide who wins
