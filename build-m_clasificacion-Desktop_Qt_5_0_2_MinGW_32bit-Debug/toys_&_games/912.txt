 What a neat toy! This has been the BEST addition to our train set for quite awhile. My only complaint is that the coal car should be a little larger but other than that, this thing is nothing short of awesome. My little one plays and plays with this thing and we've had it for over a year now. It is clearly the favorite and I've now been told that I can get rid of all the other trains but we HAVE to keep the Polar Express. This is made by Brio so it doesn't really have all the details the Thomas trains have but it's no less entertaining. It doesn't use batteries that much - ours last at least a couple of months before wearing out. It's just a very neat way to bring the movie to life in your own home and quite the treasure. If you can find one (try ebay), grab it. It certainly is worth every penny. Great toy, highly recommend
