 I purchased this slide for my 15 month old. She loves it and did from the moment she climbed on. However, it is much smaller than it appears. It is maybe three and a half feet tall. My daughter figured out how to climb the steps in the first 5 minutes and within minutes after that she was climbing up 2 steps at a time. (that's how small it is). On the plus side, it is also easy to fold and store because of it's small size. As much as she loves it now, I am scared she will outgrow it in a couple of months. Regardless, I am happy to have it since she's happy to have it
