 After assembling a Dora's Talking Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this Christmas! This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect. Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker. My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't! It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on. I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!
