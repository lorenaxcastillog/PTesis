 I just got this and my kids love it. We bought this because it was small and didn't take up a ton of room like a full play stove. My kids have been wanting a play kitchen, but with four kids and a tiny apartment, there just wasn't the room for one. I like that it's self contained and small for storage purposes. So when they want to play they only have to dig it out and set it up but it's easily stored on a shelf when it's not in use. I also like that it's wood vs plastic. I'm trying to get away from plastic toys whenever possible. I bought a Super Baking Set and a Super Cooking Set for their utensils. I like the qaulity of those as well. All items from both sets fit into the stove for storage minus the little measuring cup. It would have fit but it was just a bit too high. I fully plan on buying more Alex cooking fun
