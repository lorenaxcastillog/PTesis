 I have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept. I have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept. The lines are blurry, there is no focus to begin with. But the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base, whenever you move it, touch it, etc. The dry erase markers don't erase from the board; and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it. I can't fathom buying a new light bulb at $4.95 + s&h after a total hour of use in two sessions. I think it's probably wiring; who knows; but it's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage.
