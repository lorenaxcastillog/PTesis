 You really need the center to play with the doll unless you have other interactive pieces at home. The food for the doll comes with the center as well as the rooms that make it toddler aged...my daughter wanted it for the potty training area but when she got it, she realized the doll didnt undress to actually train her. It is a must buy if you get the doll; just try to buy on sale. I don't like it because it is hard to store. It is prettly flimsy to break down with every use. You will need somekind of container for the pieces or they are easily lost
