 These were given to my 2 1/2 year old as a gift and I will admit that, at first, I thought it was a rather dull gift. My daughter LOVES it, though. She uses the cookies for counting (and sometimes counts the M&Ms on top). She also has fun playing with them in her kitchen. She cooks the cookies and feeds them to her stuffed animals. She counts how many cookies each doll gets. She spends a lot of time arranging the cookies (and other foods) in the cookie jar. It's really a great toy. We like a lot of the Learning Resources products.
