 I received this game as a gift. Previously, I had thought about purchasing it, but opted out because I had read comments about it before. Sooo, when I got it as a gift I thought, What do I have to lose? I attempted to play it in one DVD player. As soon as it got to the menu part, the darn thing just shut off! After trying this several times, I decided to try it in another DVD player, a newer one, and found that I could make it to the menu, but I couldn't scroll through the cases! I am so disappointed that I never got to actually play the game! I also feel bad for the person who bought it for me because they knew how much I enjoy the show and was trying to make me happy. It is called DEAL OR NO DEAL, and I got the NO DEAL. Anyway, I would highly recommend not buying this game. I think I am going to stick to board games for awhile.
