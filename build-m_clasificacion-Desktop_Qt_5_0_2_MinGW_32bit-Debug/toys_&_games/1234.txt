 Excellent game. I did not want to get a console game system for my son because I knew I'd never see him again. This game however gets him up and moving. (Read...tires him out after awhile) The controller is very responsive, yet challenging enough to make sure you've got to practice a bit to do some of the trick moves. Alas...my weight keeps me from enjoying this fairly (200lbs. limit) but my son and I have a lot of fun with this new game and I expect his friends will be having competitions with him. It is one of the best electronic games I've ever bought for pure enjoyment. I'd buy it again.
