 If you've mastered the 3x3 cube and are looking for a challenge, go for the 4x4. As we all know, competitive cubing is almost exclusively on the 3x3...however, if you want to bone up on your cubing skills this is a great training cube. There are so many more combinations and permutations of cube coloring in the 4x4 design...think about it, there are 96 sub-cubes in this version vs. 54 in the original 3x3 cube. Like many of the other Rubik's products, this cube is not flawless. Stickers peel easy and there's a bit of squeak in the twist action. I wouldn't use in a competition, but like I said 4x4s are rarely used for competition. Buy as a training aid
