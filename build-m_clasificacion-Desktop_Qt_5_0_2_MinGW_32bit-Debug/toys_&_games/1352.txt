 Ok, we got this last year for my 5 year old son, it is a bit to put together, but IT IS EXTREMELY DURABLE!!! trust me, after a year of not only the 5 year old, but twin 3 year olds and a 1 year old.. it has survived more than its fair share,a nd still looks brand new. It is a great addition to all the rescue hero stuff, the firetruck fits nicely, as does the helicopter.. i would defintiely suggest this to tie it all together!!!!! My crew has had a blast with this, the rescue heroes are Great for saving all those barbies from a fate worse than death!!!! I have to say out of any toy we ahve purchase the resuce hero sets are BY FAR the most durable, and fun!!!!
