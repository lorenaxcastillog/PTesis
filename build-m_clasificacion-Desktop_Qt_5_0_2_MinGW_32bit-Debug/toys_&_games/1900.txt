 I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old, and she loves it! She plays with this toy over and over again. It does so much to keep her attention! She is now 16 months and STILL plays with it over and over again each day. It is just a great toy to have! I am glad I bought it! I love the Laugh and Learn line of toys from Fisher Price...we have just about ALL of them as they are just a great line of toys to teach your child things and yet fun to play with for the child...they are defintely not boring toys
