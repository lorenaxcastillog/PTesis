 This game is not as high quality as it could be, all be it it's a simple game. The pieces consist of little blocks and chips, which are like the really old thin plastic poker chips. All you do is roll the die and try to get the most chips by landing on them, with the other people placing blockers hear and there to get you from reaching your goal. I guess the game is somewhat unpredictable, because anyone can land on you and take all your chips away, but it gets monotonous after a while, and the game just isn't as high quality as most. Overall it's an alright game, but if you have a lot of other high-quality games (Cranium, Monopoly, etc.) I doubt this is for you
