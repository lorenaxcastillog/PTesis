 My son just received this for his 3rd birthday. Since we live in Florida, he has already been able to use it this year. The picture on the website and package is a bit deceiving------it is not nearly as long as they try to make it appear. Nonetheless, my son loves this and is having a great time with it. Also, package indicated that this is for ages 5 and up. Maybe there is a slight possibility of a choking hazard if one of the small pieces were to come off, but I think this is highly unlikely. I think this is perfect for a 3 year old or even younger. Also, super easy to set up and put away when not in use
