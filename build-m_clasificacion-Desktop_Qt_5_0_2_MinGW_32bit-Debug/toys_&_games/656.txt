 I purchased this book when we took the kids (10, 8 and 8) to visit the Louvre this summer so they would have some idea why we were wandering around that vast building. Little did I know that it would spark an interest in my 8 year old son that borders on the obsessive. He has read the book two dozen times, spouts off all kinds of interesting facts about the artists and the times, and studies the paintings intently (this from a kid who has no artistic talent at all and whose favorite pasttime is sparring with his brother). The stories behind the paintings, the odd facts about the artists and the practices of the Renaissance period, are all presented in a compelling way with beautiful illustrations to boot. I recommend this highly readable and entertaining book
