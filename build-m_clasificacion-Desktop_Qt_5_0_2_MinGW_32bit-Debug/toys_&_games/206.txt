 I have bought two of these toys for my son, an only child and pretty gentle on toys. It has been kept in his bedroom away from his playgroup. He has not even played with it regularly. Yet BOTH times these toys BROKE WITHIN MONTHS OF PURCHASE!!! Yes, it is fascinating. And like other reviewers, I've also had some fun with it myself. But I am disgusted that it broke down so easily--twice. There must be a reason that Amazon doesn't offer new ones for sale; please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere. Unless you don't mind looking at the $30 you'll pay as a month or two of entertainment, look to other gear toys that don't depend upon this lousy motor.
