 This was my 5 1/2-year-old's most favorite gift this Christmas. He plays with it every single day. At first he didn't think he could build it himself but the way the step-by-step drawings were printed and the way each of the train car pieces were separately packaged really made it easy for him. We thought he would build it once and that would be it but now that he's got the hang of it, he likes to break it apart, put other lego people in the coach and try other ideas. The different speeds are fun, too. It's amazing how well the train stays on the tracks even at the highest speed which really whips it around. My Thomas the Tank Engine fan is really having a terrific time with this toy. PS - He's had the primos and the duplos but this is his first set of big kid "little legos" and he's thrilled
