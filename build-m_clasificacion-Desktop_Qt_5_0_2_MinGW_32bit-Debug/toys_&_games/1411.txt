 I originally purchased 4 of these for my husband for Father's Day to play with our three boys and at $5.00 each plus free shipping, I thought if they didn't work, what the heck, I spent $20.00 and they can pretend they work! Well, when they opened them up and got them figured out,(It took a good hour because they are very sophisticated)they didn't put them down all day! I wished I would have bought one for everyone of their friends on the block! What a great value! They play with them everyday- outside and inside! I am so glad I got these-a very good bonding experience for father and sons! The week after I received these, I went to Circuit City and sure enough, these were on the shelf for $50.00 each! You won't regret this purchase!
