 As a mother of 5, this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time. My son received it for Christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful. We place it in his bed at naps and at night, and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it. When he wakes up, it is there for him to play with. As he has grown (he is now 7 months), he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy, and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething. I have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not annoying like most musical children's toys) and I will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level. LOVE THIS TOY!
