 I have read all the reviews of this toy including the two negative reviews. I then went to the store and looked at the toy for myself and eventually bought it. The negatives: First, I do not agree with those who complained about the noise. With use of the pooh crawler I have not experienced any loud or disturbing noises and my baby did not scream or cry when pooh crawls up to her. That said, this is not necessarily the miracle toy that is going to get your baby crawling within two days. My baby is just over 5 months old and pooh is teaching her to crawl at a very slow rate. This is a minor negative, but my expectations were very high from reading some of the other reviews. As for the possitives: Crawling Pooh is cute, durable and a good teacher (albeit slow). My daughter seems to enjoy the company of the Pooh so long as I do not pay more attention to the toy than she wants. Overall I am happy I bought this toy and look forward to the continued progress on my daughter learning to crawl
