 I bought this for my 5 year old son who loves to draw. The crayons are cheap, compared to Crayola. We tested the 10 different reds searching for the correct "spiderman" red, but they all looked too pink, and pretty much the same color. Also really waxy. The oil crayons are terrible, totally waxy - no oil at all. Markers are OK (so far), but why provide two of each color with the same thin tip? They could have given a broad and thin tip marker in each color instead. The case does seem pretty sturdy, so worst case I'll replace the contents with better quality art supplies. I'm going to look around for something better... if I find it, this is going back to Toys R Us. Any ideas?
