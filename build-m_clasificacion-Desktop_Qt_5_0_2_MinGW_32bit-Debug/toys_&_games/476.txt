 This kitchen is reasonably priced with lots of kitchen accessories. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has fun playing with it when she's in the mood to play kitchen. It has most of the "kitchen" things you'd think of: sink, dishes, pots, pans, oven, mixer, etc. The food has RFID chips built in so when you put them in the pan/pot on the stove, it speaks and says things like, "mmm, eggs... and... bacon, you're a great cook! (frying sound)". This mostly amazes adults. The biggest gripes are the oven is unnecessarily small (like they were trying the RFID in the oven as well and it didn't work) and the refrigerator door has HORRIBLE fit and won't close. Overall, for the price this kitchen satisfied and has lots of accessories. If you can live with the bad fit and finish, this is one of the more bargain kitchen toys available
