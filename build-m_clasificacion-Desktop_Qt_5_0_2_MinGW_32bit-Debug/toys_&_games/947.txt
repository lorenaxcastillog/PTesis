 I can't think of a better toy. There are a gazillion ways to use this toy, from pre-walking through kindergarten. It's a set of blocks, a bead maze, a walker, a pretend lawn mower, a pretend shopping cart, a pretend car, a pretend doll stroller, a step-stool, a storage chest.... And it has wheels and lids, which are the best inventions on earth as far as our 15-mo is concerned. If you have hardwood floors, I recommend a quick fix to slow the cart down for pre-walkers... With our hardwood floors, this Walker rolled too fast for our pre-walker to control. So, I super-glued foam-rubber KidKushions** onto the corners of the back edge. The KidKushions (sold as babyproofing supplies) drag along the floor just enough to slow the cart down. [...] Now that our guy is walking pretty well, he still loves this toy. I recently used some bicycle-chain lubricant on the wheels so that they would stop squeaking so much. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend doing that if you still have a pre-walker. The wheel friction also helped to slow the cart down a bit
