 This game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it. His little sister, who is two, also loves this game. This game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues. It is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept. There are no complex rules to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game. As each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match. Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the TV turned off
