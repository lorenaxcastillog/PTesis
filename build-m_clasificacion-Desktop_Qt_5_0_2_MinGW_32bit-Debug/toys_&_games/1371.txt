 I bought this kit to do face painting at my daughters 4th birthday. I wish I would have opened it a week before then I would have realized that it is AWFUL. The "paints" transferred almost no color, the small sponge applicators were useless b/c the amount of pressure needed to pick up any color caused them to pop off. The "crayons" worked a little better but were still really faint. We ended up using the "crayons" to color some faces on gourds and then threw the kit away. It wasn't even worth saving to try to figure out a way to make it work. Don't waste your money
