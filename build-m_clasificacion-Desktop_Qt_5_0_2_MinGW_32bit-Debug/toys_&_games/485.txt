 My five year-old daugther wanted this Barbie computer Christmas after receiving the younger Barbie computer for her 3rd birthday. She did not get it because it seemed expsensive but bought it herself with her Christmas money. She loved it from the start. She likes the games and the Spanish on it, too. She loved the mouse at first but then realized that it doesn't travel as well as the ones without a mouse (needs a solid surface versus using it in the car, airplane, drs office). The screen could be larger of course. She finds some games a challenge to figure out the rules and how-tos but overall loves her computer. She is very pleased with her purchase and I think she will be playing it for a couple years. The games are good for the ages 5-8 range
