 I bought this toy for my son (the boy's version) for his 2nd birthday. It was fun for a few days...until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard. The toy landed on top of him, with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy. He was so terrified of it after that, he refused to get back on. It has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale. Save your money - this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering
