 My 8-year old picked this up yesterday, she was very excited. In summary, after about 15 minutes, she was in tears over the thing. Reason being is that she was frustrated with the overall navigation and controls for configuring and setting up the thing. We located the instructions buried in the packaging, and were able to eventually get past it. After configuring, she had the instructions out trying to send messages - she finally was able to do it, but it's not very easy. In addition, the IR is a severe limitation as line of sight must be maintained. This product would be much better if it was RF-based, and was less cryptic in the initial setup, as well as sending a message. For example to send a message, here's process: - Chat Mode button - type message - send button - it then asks for the P/I? which we have no clue what that is - then hit ICQ button Several steps, lots of button pushing, not the most intuitive. Recommend that you do not buy this
