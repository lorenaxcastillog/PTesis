 Purchased this for our almost seven year old neice. She has one doggy Fur Real and loves it. Polar bear makes less motor noises, which is good. Switch is a little hard to reach, but that also means it is very well-hidden. Child-size fingers can get to it better than adult-size fingers. Had some trouble getting it to do the hug function. It think it's supposed to stretch out its arms (which it did) and then close them into a hug (which it didn't). Our neice is better at this stuff than me, so maybe she got it to work. Everything else -tickling laugh, eating, burp, hunger grunts and snoring worked fine. Very cute. Just remember to turn these guys off when you're done. Otherwise they go into sleep mode, but the batteries are still being gradually drained
