 I had water rockets like this when I was a kid in the early 1970s. The rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package. They shoot high and straight and are loads of fun. My only gripe is with the pump. When I was a kid, the pump was heavy plastic and metal. The pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic. The knob on the end broke off the first or second day. My son and I are still able to shoot the rockets, but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket.
