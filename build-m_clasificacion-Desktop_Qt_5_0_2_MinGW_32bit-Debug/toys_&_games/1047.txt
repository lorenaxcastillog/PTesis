 people who said that this doll looked gothic and wore too much makeup have problems. i'm 14 years old and still play with dolls. just because some one wears black doesn't mean that they are goth. besides no one is goth any more most people are something called punk. she is not wearing too much makeup. if you can read it says she is going out to a dance party. if you go out to dance your not going to go with zero make up, and no one cares about 'this girl in your class that wears too much makeup' they care about the doll. i have this doll and luv her. anyone who likes her will like the bratz princess twiinz
