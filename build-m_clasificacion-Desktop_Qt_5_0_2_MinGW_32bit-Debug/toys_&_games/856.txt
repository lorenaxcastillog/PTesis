 We have had this magnetic ABC book for a year now. We take it out to look at together every few weeks or so. The pieces are all intact and the book is fairly entertaining. My 2-year-old likes to take all of the pieces out, one by one, and then he will name the pictures as he puts them back in the correct positions. In my opinion, the illustrations are just OK, but then, that's not really the point of this product. My 2-year-old book fanatic will sit and "read" his books for 45 minutes at a time, several times a week. This is not one of his favorites, but every so often, he seems to enjoy it. It's something different anyway. I like the "hands-on" approach this book provides. This would make a great car or plane trip toy, provided that you bring a carry case for all of the pieces. This is quiet, educational, somewhat engaging and requires no batteries
