 This is a cute toy. My young son loves to push it around and hear the "Old McDonald" tune play. Each animal can be pressed to hear their animal sounds. Each barn yard animal can be taken out to be played with individually too. This toy goes great with the Fisher Price Little People Farm set. My son uses his with his farm set. THe only recommendation I can make to this toy is that it would have been neater if the song had the lyrics to teach the child the song. It is only a brief part of the tune that plays. Depending upon which animal is pressed, during the song that animal's sound will join the tune. That's cute.
