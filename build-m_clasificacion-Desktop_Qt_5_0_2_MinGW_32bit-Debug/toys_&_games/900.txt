 The fact that I could order the game was a plus. The fact that it couldn't be shipped to me because I have an APO/FPO address made me mad. I had to send the game to my father, and then have him send it to me. I was trying to order the product as a gift for a friend. It was given to him a month later rather than on his birthday like I wanted to. I'm assuming the game was okay because I had to give it to him late. I don't understand why I can order some games through Amazon and get them, but not other games of the same kind. This needs to change.
