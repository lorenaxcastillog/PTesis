 We wanted something that would provoke more imagination than just a house for my son's 2nd birthday. This seemed perfect, as it is more "boy" with the activity sides for the gas station & sports stuff. At the local Toys R Us, they had it and 1 "house" set up, and my son never even noticed the other one. My husband set it up himself in about 30 minutes (with "help" from my son), but he did use the electric screwdriver. My son LOVES it. He plays in it every day, and he even uses the soccer net for playing golf. Great gift idea
