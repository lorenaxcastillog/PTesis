 My 3 year old came to me with a screw and 2 other pieces. I figured it came from a toy but could not figure out which toy. Then today she comes to me with her skate in 2 pieces. Then it hit me which toy the loose screws were from. I also have a 10 and a half month old who crawls around on the floor and puts things in his mouth. I can only imagine what might have happened if my 3 yr old did not give me the screws from her skate. Anyway, she can't skate with them on. She falls every five seconds. This product is very unsafe and should be recalled
