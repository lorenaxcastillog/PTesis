 We received this toy before our daughter was born and I had hung it up just above her changing table for her to look at. Once she could see it, it provided endless entertainment while I changed her. Once she was able to pull it down, she took it with her everywhere. She love the rattle in the butterfly "leg" and the squeeker in the ladybug "leg." She is now a year old and still loves this toy. I attach it to her stroller with the leg containing a yellow triangle and it keeps her quiet longer than any other toy and she can't throw it over board as it is attached to her stroller
