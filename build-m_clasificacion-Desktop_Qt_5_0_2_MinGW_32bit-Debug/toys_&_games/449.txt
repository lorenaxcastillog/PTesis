 I've read the other reviews...as I was skimming the website to order another of these wands. Guess you folks had a bad batch of wands, because my son is crazy about his. We gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday, and it's one of his favorite toys! Yes, it is messy...it's a giant bubble wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there wasn't a mess? But if you keep it out doors, I don't see the problem. My son was able to make bubbles right away (something he wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow (he sucks air in instead of out). His father and I played for over an hour with this wand...taking turns making the bubbles and letting him pop them (and vice versa). I don't know why the other folks had some difficulty...but I would highly recommend this toy for a 2-3 year old.
