 If you were planning to serve your eager children a half cup of chilled but still liquid half&half with sugar and seaweed in it but thought making them wait a half hour first would increase the enjoyment, fine. But don't bother buying this item because the assembly, clean up and expense are a waste of your time and money. Two cautions: Because it is a child oriented activity it is not for those who use the occasional swear word and everyone should wear safety goggles in case you decide to smash the device into even more pieces. This review is based on several trials. Thanks for the refill packs, gift giver
