 I just purchased one of these to make PVDs for my 3-yr old daughter, and it's great! The software is easy to install and use. I was going to buy her a small personal CD player for XMas because she loves music, but this product basically doubles as a CD player because I can burn her a PVD full of the songs she loves! The buyer who indicated that they had problems with the installation most likely didn't have updates installed for Windows or something...I initially got an error when I tried to install the software, but I was simply missing an updated version of one of the required files. I did also find on the Hasbro website a form to order additional blank PVDs for $1.50 each...not too bad in my opinion. I am going to order at least 10 more!!! The Media Wizard is terrific!!
