 The main reason why I purchased this set was because of the red dragon. There are very few red dragons released in the Dragons building toy lines and it's bright color drew me in. I had no idea that the toy was encased in a metal tin, which is a terrific convenience for storage. Many of the other pieces are repaints from previous Dragons collections, but I had never been able to purchase them in time because Mega Bloks only has one production run of any set. The arches and staircase really make this piece stand out viewing from the front, but the back is really forgetable. The catapult as a siege weapon and the bonus winged beast (at the moment I cannot remember what they are called) were nice touches. Over all I would say that it would be a fabulous starter set for anyone getting into Dragons
