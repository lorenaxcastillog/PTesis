 My daughter is 18 months old and she loves to play with blocks. She developed interest in bigger blocks that came with the activity table. She liked to create a tower with it. To elaborate more of her hand-eye co-ordination skills, I bought this 90 piece bucket for her. It is a perfect first blocks set for a toddler. The blocks are not too big like Mega blocks and not much small like Duplo blocks. This size is perfect for their tiny hands to work with. Plus I find the bucket has nice quantity of blocks, not too many to get tired of the mess and not too little so that the young ones get to explore enough
