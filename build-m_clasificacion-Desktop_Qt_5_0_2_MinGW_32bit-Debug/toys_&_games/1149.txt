 First thing I would like to say is that the shampoo bottle that it comes with is a choking hazard. The cap comes of and its a small yellow tube that can get lodged in a child's throat. For this reason this doll was put on 2005's worst toy list. The good news? Simply throw away that part. My child had no interest in the shampoo bottle anyway. She loves the doll. My daughter LOVES bath time now that she has a baby to take into the bath with her. She loves it. She can't quite get the shower feature to work on her own. (she's 2) but she loves giving her baby a bath. Another plus is that the floatie will also hold a water baby doll. SO she plays with her Water Baby doll and her little mommy bath doll.
