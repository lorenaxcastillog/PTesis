 I am expecting to give a 5 star review. I have not used this product yet. I just purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She has been telling me that she wants the Easter Bunny to bring her a computer. Mommy works on a laptop all day and she is so interested in using my keyboard. I thought this looked like a real laptop and it should interest her as much as mine does. I have originally thought that this would be too advanced for her (ages 5 and up listed on my box), but after reading a few of the reviews it might just be the right challege that she needs.
