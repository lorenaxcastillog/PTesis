 My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk. While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development. The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it. Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month. For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking
