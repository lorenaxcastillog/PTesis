 TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS TYCO THINKING. $70 FOR THE TOY AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERY PACK SEPARATELY?!?!?! NOT TO MENTION I COULD NOT FIND THE BATTERY PACK ANYWHERE. ALL THE STORES WERE SOLD OUT. ALL WEB SITES (TOYS R US, KAYBEE TOYS, ETC) WERE SOLD OUT. ALL OTHER SITES (SPECIALTY HOBBY SHOPS) HAD THEM AT RIDICULUOUS PRICES, WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING. I FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND I OPTED FOR THEIR FREE SHIPPING WHICH TOOK LONGER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE THAT MONEY SAVING OPTION WHICH HELPS. MY SON PLAYED WITH IT ONCE AND HATED IT. IT WAS HIS # 1 CHOICE ON HIS X-MAS LIST. TALK ABOUT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US BOTH
