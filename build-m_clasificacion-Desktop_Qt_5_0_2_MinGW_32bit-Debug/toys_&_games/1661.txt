 I ordered this item excited to relive some childhood memories of the game and was very disappointed. What I was hoping would be a reproduction of the original was instead an ugly, overpriced mousepad! The print quality on the board is a joke. Very blurry and an ugly blue instead of the nice cream color of the original.. And instead of a thin piece of leather-like material like the original, the board is the same thickness of a mousepad with the thick rubber backing and everything. Ok, No big deal, right? Wrong! Imagine how disappointed I was when I rolled up the board to discover the board and the stones do not fit into the tube! No wonder they ship it outside the tube in the box! The glass stones are much like the original, but very light in color -- this was about the only good thing going for the set so for that I'll give it 1 star. I sent this item back immediately upon receipt and would encourage anyone else interested in PENTE to find an original set and not buy this joke of a reproduction
