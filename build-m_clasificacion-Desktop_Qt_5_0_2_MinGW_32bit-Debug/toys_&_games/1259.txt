 More often than not, my wife and I usually end up playing games with one another as opposed to a larger group of people. Some games that we buy end up being much more fun with friends and family, but are of only limited interest for two players. Target is NOT one of those games...it works beautifully for two people. In addition, it has several other fantastic advantages over many other games: - you can remove "target" cards if you'd like to control the length of the game (just take some out if you want a shorter game) - you are never really "out" of the game, even if you seem to be trailing - it is very, very easy to learn and remember the rules - it makes you think and strategize, but not due to complicated rules - it is very travel-friendly, consisting of just a deck of cards Like other reviewers here, I love the game and can't recommend it enough. It's our "go to" game whenever we have half an hour to relax with a game.
