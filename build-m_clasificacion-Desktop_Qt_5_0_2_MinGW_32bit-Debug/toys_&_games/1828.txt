 My son LOVES these toys! I purchased them on Target clearance for one dollar and 90 some odd cents. What a deal! I went to several Target stores in the area and found different pieces for no more than three dollars. My son is 2 ½ and has great dexterity to start with but these have taught him even more skills using the screw drivers, wrenches and other little tools that are included in the set. My concern is that he could possibly fall on the metal tools and hurt himself but as of now he has been careful with them. I am also not overly pleased with the play sets but the trucks themselves are lots of fun. The play sets seem a little cheap but the die cast trucks are worth the money, so that to me makes up for the lack of imagination on the designers part. He will sit and play with them for hours on end, mixing and matching the different parts to the different trucks. This purchase was well worth the money, I just wish I would have noticed them before now. This would make a great gift for toddlers.
