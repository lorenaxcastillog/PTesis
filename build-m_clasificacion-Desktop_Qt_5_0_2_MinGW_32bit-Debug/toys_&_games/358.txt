 We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old. The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around. We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side. We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable. I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries. I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water
