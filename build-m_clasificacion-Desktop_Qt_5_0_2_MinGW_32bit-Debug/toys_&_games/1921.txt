 My almost-3-year old daughter loves this toy. She also has the Maid Marian set and loves having 2 princesses to ride in the carriage. She likes putting the knight from another set into the horse, and she can tell they all "go" together, versus her FP house. Because my daughter is a princess fantatic, this set was a huge hit: especially since Cinderella was re-released and *this* set has a carriage. Who knew a 3 year old would know what a carriage for a ball was? I think it's delightful she actually pretends to go to a ball and carries on conversations between the princesses. For imaginative play, I gave this toy a 5 star rating. Our princess is a bit well-loved (some paint missing), but who wouldn't be after continual living in a little girl's pocket? Definitely a recommended toy
