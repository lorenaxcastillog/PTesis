 We got this for our son for Christmas and love it. Lucky enough it did have his name and his sisters name to program. However, the daily schedule looses about 30 seconds everyday, and before you know it, it's telling him it's time to eat dinner at 4:30 rather than the 5:00 I had it set for. So I have to re-sync it with the computer every few days. Also, Pooh has yet to mention my son's birthday or do the 'countdown', and that was a feature we were really excited about. All in all, it's a fun toy, and we're glad we got it for our son to play with
