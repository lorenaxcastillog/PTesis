 My daughter has had this set for about three years, and she still plays with it! She's seven now, and would probably kill me for divulging this information, but she enjoys it now more than she did when she was younger. When our neighbors come over to play, all they want to do is "cut the food, please." I bought them their own set for Christmas this year. The pieces are very easy for little fingers to manipulate, and the quality is outstanding. I love the classic toy look. They are very easy to put back together, and you've gotta love something that comes in its own storage box
