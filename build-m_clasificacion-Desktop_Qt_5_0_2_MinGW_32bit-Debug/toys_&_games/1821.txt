 My son got Chicka Chicka Blue as a present when he was 2 months old. As he has gotten older (he is now 7 months old) he has grown to love her even more! He loves watching Blue's Clues and Blue's Room and adores every time he hears chicka Chicka Blue say, "Hi, you!" His smile could light up a room! Blue's cheery voice and fun story-telling/singing never gets annoying. And even though my son doesn't know how to work her himself, he and I play with this toy every single day. Whether she is singing the ABCs and dancing or making animal sounds, Blue is sure to entertain even the youngest crowd
