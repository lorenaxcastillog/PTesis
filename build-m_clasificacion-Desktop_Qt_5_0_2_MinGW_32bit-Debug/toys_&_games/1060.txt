 GOOD PART: This thing will fly high,soar on currents, and is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. I would recommend it to someone with at least SOME experience! The controls are touchy and it will spiral to the ground if you hold too long. It's pretty tough and will take some hard hits without damage. BAD PART : I only got eight good charges out of eight AA batteries and am experimenting with charging from a 12V mower battery. Rechargeable AA's ("Pure Energy") are available from a Canadian company. A great plane for kids is the little bi-plane from "Air Hog". It's practically bulletproof, easy to fly, and doesn't eat up batteries
