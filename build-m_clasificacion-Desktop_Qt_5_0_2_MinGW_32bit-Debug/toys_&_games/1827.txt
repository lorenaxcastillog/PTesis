 This is a great set! My son got this for his 3rd birthday & he & his 6 year old sister enjoy it tremendously. They can both play together since there are so many things to do. The set comes with a bunch of play doh, cutters, stampers, plastic scissors & a little knife to cut the play doh. The funnest part is the table on top has little molds to make all sorts of fun stuff. It also includes some crayons & paper, but I am not really sure why; they seem out of place in the set. The neatest thing about this set is that when they are done, they can use the little tool to pick up the loose play doh pieces & put all the parts & doh back into storage case very easily. This would be great for any child that enjoys play doh, it has so many features there is fun for anyone, & more than one child can play at a time. It also has a lot more space if you want to expand & buy other play doh toys & store them in the box.
