 We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios. It's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions. This toy also teaches numbers. Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo
