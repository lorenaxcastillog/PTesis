 My daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas. I chose this one, and she was so pleased. THe doll is beautiful. She did not quite sit the right way in her raft. Someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it, or it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house with her, but that it had to hang and dry. Still she loved this doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the material around the leg wripped. Instead of trying to sew it, I figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also, we said goodbye. This year I am getting her another doll that goes in the bath, but I am getting the Paul Drink and wet doll by corolle. It is a lot more expensive, but I think it will be worth it.
