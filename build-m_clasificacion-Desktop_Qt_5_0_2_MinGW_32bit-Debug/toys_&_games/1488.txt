 I was more than pleased with the puzzle map of the United States. As a child I can remember having one, and loving it. It was heavy-duty cardboard as I remember. Then when I grew up and had my own children I read an article that said there were several toys you should buy for your children if you want to raise geniuses, and one of them (not being a genius myself, I remember only one of them) was a puzzle map of the U.S. So my children always had one. And I have a wooden one that I keep here for my grandchildren. The Puzzibilities Deluxe map was bought for the grandson of a friend. I almost kept it in place of the one I have, it was so much nicer.
