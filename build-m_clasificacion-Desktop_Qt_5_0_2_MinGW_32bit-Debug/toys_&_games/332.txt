 Bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it. More challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games. I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and introducing the concept of strategy
