 We just bought this for our 3 year old. I do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over!! Cute game idea- But this was not well put together. First I about died when I saw the super cheap, barely cardboard gameboard!!!!!!! It is a VERY small board, set up like a 4 piece puzzle, that I predict will barely stay together after a few plays. the jewelery, subpar. the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and plain. But is serves it purpose just fine :). I give this low marks for educational and durablity. BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying. My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game.
