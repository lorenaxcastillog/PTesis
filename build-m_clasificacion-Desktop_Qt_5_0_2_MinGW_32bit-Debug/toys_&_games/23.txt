 First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition. When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me. I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition. I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call
