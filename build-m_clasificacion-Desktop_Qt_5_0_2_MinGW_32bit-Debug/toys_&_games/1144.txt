 My daughter got this for christmas when she was 2 1/2 and she loved it from day one. Her daddy is a avid golfer and they have logged countless hours in the back yard together hitting the balls around. The educational value is great for hand eye and for patience. Also for sharing and taking turns when the other kids come over and want to play with it. ( they love it!!) As far as the durability..... if my daughter ( RAMBOETTE) can distroy something she will and it has held up beautifully. not a problem one. Found that regular golf balls work in it also wiffle balls and ping pong balls also to solve the missing ball delema. I am getting 4 of them for my nephews so that we can have our own golf tournie!!
