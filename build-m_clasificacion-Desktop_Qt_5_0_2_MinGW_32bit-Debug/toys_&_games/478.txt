 I bought this game for my new family for Christmas. This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember playing for countless hours as a child. First of all, my old game had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly attached to the game board. With the new version, all of these things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board. Also, the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot. The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car. Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial. I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future
