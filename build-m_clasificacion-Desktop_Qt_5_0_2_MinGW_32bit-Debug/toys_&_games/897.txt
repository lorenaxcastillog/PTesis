 I purchased baby alive for my six year old daughter. She absolutely loves her. This a great buy, but keep in mind she does require food, diapers, and clothes. The baby alive diapers are expensive, and are hard for my daughter to put on her so we buy preemie diapers from walmart. The only complaint that I have is that the color on her lips does come off so we found a sharpie of similar color to put on them. Other than that she is a great doll. My daughter is very particular so I am happy that she likes her
