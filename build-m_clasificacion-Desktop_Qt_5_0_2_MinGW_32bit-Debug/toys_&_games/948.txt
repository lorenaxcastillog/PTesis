 We bought this walker for our daughter's first birthday and she absolutely loves it. She plays with it all the time and is really proud of herself for learning to walk with it. She just beams when she is using it. The solid wood construction makes it very durable. Its tip-proof design makes it safe too. My daughter can pull to a standing without the walker falling over. She even climbs on the front of it and it still does not tip. Did I mention how cute it is too? Reminds me of those good old fashion wood toys but kicked up a notch. Can't say enough good things about this walker. One of the best toy purchases we have made yet.
