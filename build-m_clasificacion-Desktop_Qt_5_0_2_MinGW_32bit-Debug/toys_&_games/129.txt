 I purchased two of these cases for my daughters, ages 5 and 7, but we were all disappointed with them. It supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories, but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in. They also come apart everytime the girls open them, and they are hard for the girls to put back together. They are good for keeping all the little Barbie accessories out of the way. I just wish they were better quality. A friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter (with a zipper), and she says it is great, but I have not been able to find that item anywhere
