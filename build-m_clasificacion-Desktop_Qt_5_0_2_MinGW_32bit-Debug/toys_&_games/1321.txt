 hey people, its only $20.00. if you are gonna gripe about the joystick then go out and buy a refurbished upright arcade version for $3,500.00. its supposed to be fun, its not a highly tuned race car. we not only also have the same problem with the joystick, but most of the time if you are smooth enough with the controls you will have no problems. we are about to buy our 2nd console since we have played it so much that we almost wore the joystick out...remember how they used to get in the arcade...lol. not to beat a dead horse, but if the joystick messes up, simply finish the game or hit reset and start over. beats putting a quarter in every time
