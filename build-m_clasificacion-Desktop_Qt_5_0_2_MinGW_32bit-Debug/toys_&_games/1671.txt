 I gave this a 5 star rating as a toy not as a safe!! My 9yr old daughter received this safe as a christmas gift and it is her favorite out of all of the toys she got. The best part is that the combination is easily reset so that when it is forgotten you can still get at your stuff. With the alarm and the security code she loves hiding away her gameboy from her younger sister. This is not a secure functional safe -- it is a toy with a drawer and an easily resetable combination code. Great for younger kids. My 4yr old wants one for her birthday now so that she can hide away her treasures from her siblings
