 I bought this item two years ago specifically for my then-5yr-old daughter. She wanted a drum set, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. My daughter enjoyed pounding on the drums, but the drums are not of great quality and the electronic crash of a cymbal or thump of a drum pad is hardly heard above the din of a wooden drumstick against hard plastic. The unit is top-heavy and can easily be bumped and fall over. The footpad is essentially useless. In sum, I should have either paid more money to get a nice Yamaha electronic drumset, or a real drumset, or just forestalled the decision entirely. After I couldn't take the rukkus of my kids pounding (not playing) with the thing, I hauled it up to the attic and there it's been ever since. Interestingly, my kids never asked for it again
