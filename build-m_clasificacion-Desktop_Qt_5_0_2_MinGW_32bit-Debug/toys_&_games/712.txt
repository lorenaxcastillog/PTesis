 I got this for my oldest three children ages 11, 8, and 7 as a gift from Santa along with an opening "balance". The children loved the idea of having to write checks and now when they want something they can write their "bankers"(aka Mom and Dad) a check and we will buy it. So they are learning that once it's spent its gone, so are trying to decide should they save or spend. Since they have no actual money its not burning holes in pockets or getting lost. They are actually thinking about diffrent things and when we say get your check book the re-think the decision about wheather they really want it or not. I'm hoping it not only keeps them from "borrowing" from one another but make sure they really want what they buy, so it's not stuck in the toy chest within the week. Would have given more stars but it's to early to tell how this will work in the long run
