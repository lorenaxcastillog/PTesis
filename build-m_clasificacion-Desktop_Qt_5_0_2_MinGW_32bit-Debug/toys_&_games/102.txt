 This thing took about 6 hours to build. The directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow, but I figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool. Unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor, on fresh batteries, didn't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently. We spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it. Ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside. He looks really cool, but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot. I love KNEX, but this set is a DUD
