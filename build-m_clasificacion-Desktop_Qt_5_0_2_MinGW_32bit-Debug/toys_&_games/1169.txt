 I've had the original Mastermind for about 30 years, and it's a great way to hone logic skills. My 5-year-old recently got Mastermind for Kids as a gift, and I was disappointed. I guess it's "cute" to make the game look like a bowl of Lucky Charms or something, but in the kids' version there are NO PEGS - the pieces get scattered everywhere, ruining the game, with one false move. Tedious and very frustrating, especially for little ones. The kids' version is a bit simpler as it allows for only three combinations, not four like the original; BUT you can just as easily decide to do the same with the original version anyway. GET THE ORIGINAL, IT's GREAT
