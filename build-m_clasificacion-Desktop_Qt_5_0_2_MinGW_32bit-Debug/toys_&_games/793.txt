 Got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. Both she and my son loved it, but it only comes with 8 or so pieces of cardboard and you go through them quickly. I bought refills, which were hard to find locally and they also last about 5 minutes. As other reviewers have said, get your own cardboard, any neon color works well, and use one of the original pieces as a stencil to cut them out. It's much cheaper than buying the refills if you don't mind a little bit of extra work. I bought regular cardboard which curled up after they came off the toy, but we can put a book on them when they are dry to flatten them out. Cleaning isn't too bad either. Just a couple of papertowels and voila! It's clean and ready to be used again.
