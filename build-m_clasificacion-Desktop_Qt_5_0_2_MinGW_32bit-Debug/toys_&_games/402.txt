 1. Tape as many Jenga sticks together with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that you would like to turn into a special puzzle. 2. Have your child find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle (even a favorite photo can work.) 3. Glue whole picture to opposite side of masked taped Jenga. 4. Shellac and allow to dry 5. Use excto knife and cut the picture apart. 6. Remove tape and voila`--your own hand-made puzzle! Even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own puzzle! Enjoy! Aloha
