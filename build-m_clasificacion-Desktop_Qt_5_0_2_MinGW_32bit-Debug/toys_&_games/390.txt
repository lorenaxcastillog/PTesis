 I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old. It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle. I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play. This doll is also washable, a big plus. The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly. A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years.
