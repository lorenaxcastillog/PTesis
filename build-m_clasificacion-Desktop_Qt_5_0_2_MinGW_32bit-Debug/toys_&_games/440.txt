 I went online to look for other Little Tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and I wondered why. I disagree with most of the other reviews. The handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes, on the ground, anywhere. He has never fallen or injured himself on it. In fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. Usually he just hands it to me, and points that he wants it open. I do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out. This is the only reason I'm not giving this toy five stars. But my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago. I'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much.
