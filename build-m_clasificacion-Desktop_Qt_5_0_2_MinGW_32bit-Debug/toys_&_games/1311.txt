 My almost two year has had this doll for awhile now and we bought this doll on a whim. Since then, my son has turned this doll into his sleeping security item. He has to have it in order to sleep or he doesn't sleep. Unfortunately, he only carries Eddie around by the hair so now Eddie looks more like a "Troll" doll vs. a Little People. I'm going to buy another one just to have on hand just in case. I'm not able to find this item in the stores any longer so if this is something you think your child may be interested in, you better order it now or it could be too late
