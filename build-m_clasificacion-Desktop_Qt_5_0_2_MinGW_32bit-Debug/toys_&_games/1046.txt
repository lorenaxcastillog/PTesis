 Overall, I really like this set. The cloth chair covers and tablecloth look so real. The smaller pieces such as the food are molded onto the trays so as not to get lost which I also like. This set has so much more detail than any of the previous dining rooms made by Fisher Price too. Although I like all their dining rooms, this one is so much more up to date and looks so much more authentic than the others. I would like to see four chairs instead of just two. If you have two children, they don't have anywhere to sit unless you use the tall chairs for the snack bar from the Twin Time dollhouse. They aren't the same size, but they do seem to blend pretty well except for the height. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5
