 I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual, and growing up in a family where a Saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on Sunday, as a female, I know a lot of male stuff. Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the "male" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff. We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked. It is so one sided it's not even funny. Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes. One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the "male" questions. If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again.
