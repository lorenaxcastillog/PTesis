 I bought this puzzle for my husband for Christmas. We enjoy working as a family on puzzles in our spare time. Recently my oldest daughter(5) has been discussing the Solar systmen with my husband. I thought this would be a great project and educational at the same time. We built this puzzle together and my 5 year old was even able to put the last 30 or so pieces in herself. It is challanging and interesting trying to identify the crazy pictures on the box and find where the pieces go. Now that it is together, we glued it and framed it. There it is right above my daughter's bed for her to study while she drifts off to sleep. Quality product and the price was also very resonable. This is a good one
