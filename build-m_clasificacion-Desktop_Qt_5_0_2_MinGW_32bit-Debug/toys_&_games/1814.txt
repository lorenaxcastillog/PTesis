 This car can drive the calmist mother to insanity. The amount of noise created is unbelievable and unneccesary. The remote if you can call it that has a wire that comes out of it that is NOT recommended for any child under the age of 8. When I purchased this item for my four year old, I was expecting him to be able to hit forward, backwards, left, right. The car is constantly in motion always going backwards and to the left. You hit the one button on the "remote" and it drives the car forward. My boys do not enjoy playing with this except to watch it go around and around backwards and driving mom crazy. The batteries are also easily accesible with nothing there to stop a 2 year old from taking them out and trying to eat them. Needless to say, the cars now have no batteries and my sons' arms move the cars much better than the batteries and "remote" ever could
