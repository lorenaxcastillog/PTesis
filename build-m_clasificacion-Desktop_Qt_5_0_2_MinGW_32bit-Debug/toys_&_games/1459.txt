 Edward is an older engine who is extremely kind to everyone. He is even kind to the small engines when they get into difficulties, as well as the big engines even when they are rude or impatient. Although Edward is the same blue color as Thomas (#1) and Gordon (#4), #2 Edward is a staple on the Island of Sodor--making it into almost every episode and Thomas the Tank Engine book. Edward comes in two parts, held together by a strong magnet, and is very sturdy. My son has had his for years, and it still looks good as new! (Despite HOURS of playing). Although he isn't colorful, he's a reliable fixture on the Island of Sodor
