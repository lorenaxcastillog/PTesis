 I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult. I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably! While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable. Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours. The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter. I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties
