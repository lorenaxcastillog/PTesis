 I got this Moon Sand for my kids for Christmas and I gave it to them as an early Christmas gift. Boy was that a mistake! It was more of an heasdach then playdough has ever been. The sand was EVERYWHERE! and yes you may be able to vacume it up but we lost 1/4 of the sand in the first play. Playdough you make sure there in the kitchen so when it falls it's no big deal, you pick up the big peices droped add them back to the mix, moon sand goes everywhere and aside from the fact that it doesn't come with very much sand to begin with so of course you need to buy more which works well for the manufacture because they have a continuing customer. Once this is done I will be happy to show it the garbage and save me another headach.
