 My twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3. They loved it!!! The dog is so cuddly and cute. They loved playing pretend with the accessories. My only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off, the syringe was coming apart, and the brush had lost a couple of bristles. The boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality that I had hoped for. It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just afraid that it won't last as long as their imaginations. I think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy. A real winner for young children in the hospital.
