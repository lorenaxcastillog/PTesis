 I agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely loves it. First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick. I went to Home Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great. My daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and everything else did move it around. I bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place, works great. I think we paid $19 for this at Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets. If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent, you will probably be disappointed
