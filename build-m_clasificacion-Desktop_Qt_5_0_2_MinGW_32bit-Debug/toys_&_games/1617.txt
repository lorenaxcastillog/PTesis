 My son received these blocks as a first b-day gift and they have been a favorite of his and any kid who enters our home. They are extremely durable(they hold up to standing on them)and can be used to create all sorts of things. My 4 year old is constantly creating "castles" and "houses" for her dolls and stuffed animals. My 22 month old delights in knocking them over and is now starting to stack them on his own. We make a game out of putting them away in the clear bag they came in. We store them behind a chair in our living room and almost daily my son climbs on the chair and looks over and points that he wants to play with them. I highly recommend this toy for children 18mos - 6 years
