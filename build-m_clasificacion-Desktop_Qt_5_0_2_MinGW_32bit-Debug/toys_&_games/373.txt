 Ever since my son was 10 months old he just HAD to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. So we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. Since we use a canister vacuum I wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well, and this was pretty much the only one out there. He just LOVES it, and since he is under 3, (the recommended age), I took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on & off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE. And that can be a pain- (to the car, in the highchair, on the changing table, etc.) so I've had to hide it sometimes. :) But I am very happy with this vacuum
