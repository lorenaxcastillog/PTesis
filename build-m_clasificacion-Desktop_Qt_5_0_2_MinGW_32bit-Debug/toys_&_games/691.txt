 I bought this wagon for my son this Christmas and he plays with it more than anything else in the house. Even though he hasn't had a chance to take a ride in it outside, he is loving it. He pulls it in front of the TV to watch movies and he is especially fond of the cup holders. I think that this would make the perfect gift for any child. Plus, if I am wanting to do a quick clean up of his toys it has a storage area in the seat that he is more than happy to keep filled
