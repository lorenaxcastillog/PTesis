 Forget those other trivia games, you've got to play Smarty Party! I got this game for Christmas and we had a ball playing it. At first everyone was apprehensive and only 4 of us played while others stood around and watched. Well it was far too hard for them to keep quiet so they joined in the next game and all 8 pieces were put to use. This game is sort of like Outburst but without all the chaos. Everyone plays in every round. The topics are interesting and you'll be amazed at the things your friends and family will know. Strategy, luck, and smarts all factor in, so it keeps things interesting and the person that thinks they are the smarty pants just may not be the winner! The little rubber pants are great! We are playing tonight at our New Year's Eve party and I can't wait
