 I owned a toy store and this was the dollhouse that I selected for my daughter (who was then 2). She is now 3 and has loved every minute playing with this house, furniture and dolls. The house has withstood rambunctious play, *I* was the only one to break furniture (I stepped on a chair with a heavy boot I was wearing -- but amazingly, only the leg popped off, the rest of the chair is still intact and could be fixed if I had the motivation...) and the dolls are a beautiful, heavy felt with a wired body for easy movement. They are unlike other dollhouse dolls with the wooden heads and pegged bodies, which I felt were inappropriate for a young child. All in all, this brightly colored, well made dollhouse should last my daughter until she is old enough to either grow out of it, or want to grow on to a traditional, hand-made set.
