 My son loves the original Scrabble and when he found out about this Super Scrabble, it was his must-have gift this Christmas. He loves that the playing area is larger and the quadruple score letter and word spaces make this version even more fun. The only drawback is that it can take quite a while to play an entire game (on average, it's taken us anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 hours!) so it's not something we get to play often. And, if I had my druthers, I would LOVE it if they made a deluxe version with the non-slide grids so that the board could be turned without the tiles getting jostled out of place
