 I love this backpack. My daughter is in preschool and she loves cabbage patch kids. I bought her a Dora backpack at the beginning of the school year and the zipper broke. A little girl in her class had this backpack, so of course my daugher had to have it. So I searched around and found it!! It is very durable and easy to clean. My daughter likes that it has wheels and that she can wear it like a backpack. It has alot of room inside about the same room as a childs suitcase. It is perfect to hold her art work and library book! Hope this review helps!!!
