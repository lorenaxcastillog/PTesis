 This car has been a great purchase. I bought it for my one year old. The reason being was that I was tired of having to wind up toys to make them go and/or drive them backwards so they would go forwards on their own. This car is awesome because even little kids can make it go by themselves. Literally you just shake it and it revs up. The more you shake it the faster/farther it goes. It will go a really long way. I have ratings of toys based on the required parental invovlement. Toys that require two hands of a parent are not my favorite and are only used at certain times. This is a zero hand toy for the parents - the best kind. :) I can see him enjoying this car for a few years
