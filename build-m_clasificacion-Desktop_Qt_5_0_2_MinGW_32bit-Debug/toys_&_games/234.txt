 My 3 year old daughter and I have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand. The design is nice, it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice. However, after using it twice, the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted. This makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place. It makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving. My daughter was frustrated. I eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child. I don't recommend this wand
