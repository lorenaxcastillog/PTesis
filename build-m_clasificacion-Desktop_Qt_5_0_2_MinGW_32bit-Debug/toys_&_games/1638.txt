 This is our 2nd Naturally Playful sand table. The previous one lasted for more than 2 years and was well used. I decided it was time for a new one when the other one wobbled on it's legs too much to be comfortable with. Not great support for a sand and water table. This one is constructed much better with 5 legs and a center support. The table is huge and is quite a bit deeper allowing for more kinds of playing and more area for kids to play. My only complaint is that it is 12 inches shorter! I can't find any mention of that in the literature or other reviews but it's a huge hassle. My 2 year old towers over it and my 4 year old has to sit down to use it. I wish they had longer legs I could substitute for the short ones! Otherwise it's a great table and think we'll get another few years out of this one
