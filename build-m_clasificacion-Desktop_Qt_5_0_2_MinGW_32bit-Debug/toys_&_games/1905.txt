 I purchased this top for my granddaughter, who is 2, for Christmas. She has a brother who is 5-1/2 and a cousin who is 6. They all loved it and played with it most of the day. The only drawback, as told to me by my daughter, is that it sounds a bit like a train while it is spinning, which I am sure the kids love, but after a while got on the adults nerves and they had to turn the kids attention to other toys. Other than that, I would have given it 5 stars. My grandchildren love it, and of course now that it is now Christmas day, they don't play with it constantly, so the train noise is not such an issue
