 This is a cute story, just like the cartoons and books we had growing up. My 3 year old loves the game where you invent your own candies. About the system: It's perfect. Like the story videos we used to have where the words light up at the bottom of the screen as the narrator reads them, except the pictures (true to original artwork) are totally animated AND there's interactive games and questions about the story. The guy is right about them not working with computers. The controller is basically a special remote control for the DVD player. It does work fine with small portable DVD players that have remotes, like the ones for car trips. My daughter recieved her own TV with DVD from her grandfather for Christmas. I did not approve of her watching TV all the time in her room, so I decided she could only play the Read with Me DVD's. She loves them and plays almost daily. The controller is very kid friendly. At 3 1/2 my daughter can use it all by herself
