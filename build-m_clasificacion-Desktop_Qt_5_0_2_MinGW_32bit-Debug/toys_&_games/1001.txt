 We've tried other type of marble work toys and none of them come close to the quality of this set. It is worth every penny of investment! This set is high quality construction and will not break. It sets up very well and is very sturdy (unlike the plastic warble works) if on a stable surface will stay up ... no wobbling. You will keep this set forever and pass it down through the family for generations! Go ahead and splurg on this set you will not be dissapointed! You will get more than hours and hours of entertainment out of it for the young and old
