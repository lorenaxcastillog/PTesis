 I just bought this character toy (as a toy collector) and I am impressed. It is true that some words TJ says are pronounced differently than they should be, but as the character refers to himself as five years old and it seems to make sense to me. A lot of people are comparing TJ Bearytales to Teddy Ruxpin - and as a collector of animated childrens' toys - let me tell you that just from opening TJ for the first time, that he is far more interactive than Teddy Ruxpin - and Teddy Ruxpin costs more and does less.
