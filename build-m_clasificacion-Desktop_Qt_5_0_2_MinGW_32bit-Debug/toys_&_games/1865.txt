 My daughter received this doll for Christmas along with Erica two years ago and both dolls are still going strong. They both have voice tracks which are still working, they are both in great shape, even though their hair and gowns have taken a beating. Unfortunately after two years of changing and exchanging gowns, the bodices are now ripping apart (They have already been sewn once). The loss of the gowns are the reason the rating is 4 stars instead of five. Aside from that, it is one of the nicest, if not THE nicest of their video tie-in products.
