 The screws are a pain to screw in with the little screwdriver they provide, but when I tried a power drill, it stripped the screws in no time. So I went back to the manual screwdriver and two blisters later, I think it is a really quality easel, and the storage space is an excellent idea. Most easels just don't seem worth the space they take up. The wheels are a great idea to take it outside when the weather is nice...makes for easy transport. Overall, I am very satisfied with this item, but I agree with the other reviewer about the cheap screws
