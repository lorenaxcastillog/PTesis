 This is a typical snake can and the way it's educational is that when you open it you find out it's not nuts and that it's really a snake, but then you think and reflect and notice it's not really a snake but a spring covered with cloth. It's not a snake, and it wouldn't fit into a can anyway and make it alive through shipping and still have the energy to make it out with so must gusto. Now you might think "well it ate the nuts to stay alive while it was stuck in there." But, snakes don't eat nuts, so this isn't it, face it, it's not really a snake
