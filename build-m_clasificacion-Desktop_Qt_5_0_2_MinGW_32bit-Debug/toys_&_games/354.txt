 Fly Through Spanish is some of the best software for the Fly pen available. You can write a word in English and hear the Spanish translation, or write a Spanish word and hear the English translation. The translator will also spell out translations for you (my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly, especially if you're trying to write them down). The cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn Spanish words. Fly Through Spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play. I was very impressed with the verb charts. They actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs. Fly Through Spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing Spanish words. Please keep in mind that this software will not teach you Spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program. I hope that Leapfrog releases more languages, especially French
