 I bought this for my son for Christmas and he really likes it. Better than getting a real dog, at least for now :) NOTE - It took a while to get the hang of working the docking station. When we first connected it and turned it on, nothing happened. There's a little LED light that would not come on no matter what we did. I had almost given up on it when my son re-inserted the game into it today and the light came on. Then we played around and figured out that the game had to be powered up and totally in 'play' mode (not just powered up) for it to work correctly. The docking station makes a world of difference, especially for my 40 year old eyes - can't see a thing on that tiny screen! The instructions that come with it are next to useless (and the company's web site is just as bad), but I've come to expect that when buying fairly cheap items from overseas
