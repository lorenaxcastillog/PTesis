 After reviewing several ball pits, we chose the Sesame Street Ball Pit for our 19 month old; mainly because it had Elmo, was a decent size (although it's rather large once it's set up), and was under $40 with shipping. My son loves the ball pit. He jumps through the back doorway and side opening. He plays with the basketball hoop and push-through hole, and buries himself in the balls. There is not a slide which was listed on Amazon's description. Although we have a lot of fun with the pit, there are some drawbacks. Namely: it comes with only 75 balls (200-300 more fills it nicely), it is constructed of cheaper plastic, and the blow-up rails bend down so our son can jump in or out where he's not supposed to (he loves it...I have to correct him). Overall, it's a lot of fun if you have room. It will fit 2 children comfortably, up to 4 is a squeeze
