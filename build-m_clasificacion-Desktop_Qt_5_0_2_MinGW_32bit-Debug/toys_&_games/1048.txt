 Hi. First of all I want to say, why would you buy this? I'm 12 and you might think I think this doll is cool. But it's not. This is why you shouldn't buy this: 1. This doll is looks more like a gothic person than looking like she's going to a midnight dance. 2. She's got way too much makeup on. That makes her look even more gothic. (like a girl in my class at school) 3. This......uh......thing, is totally 0% educational. Who could stand to buy such a thing for their daughter? I wouldn't recommend this doll to anybody, espicially not anyone under 11 years old. This is the type of doll that teaches kids the exact same oppasite of who their parents want them to be. It also teaches kids OTHER things. I won't even think about disscussing them. Please don't waste your money on this Bratz doll or any of the other ones. Instead, get them a barbie doll or a baby doll. Don't buy this. PLEASE. **************************PEACE EVERYWHERE********************
