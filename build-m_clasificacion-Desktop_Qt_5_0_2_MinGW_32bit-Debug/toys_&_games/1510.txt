 My son is a big fan of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. His favorite is Percy. He takes his Percy trains with him wherever he goes (to bed, in the car, around the house, etc.). We even bought an extra for him just in case he loses one of them. If your children love Thomas (and what toddler doesn't?), I do have a piece of advice--get duplicates of the trains. You never know if one will get lost, or forgotten! I got doubles of most of the trains, Percy included, and it can be a real lifesaver when one gets lost or left behind
