 We bought this for a Christmas gift for our son. What a colossal waste of money. He was so dissappointed that it was so hard to use (even with adult help). My husband had to re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once. We would have been better off to buy a strong magnifying glass and the prepared slides and looking at the slides that way. Actually finding and focusing on a slide image was almost impossible due to the cheapness of this product. It was his "big" present and turned out to be a dud. We'd return it, but that would blow Santa's cover
