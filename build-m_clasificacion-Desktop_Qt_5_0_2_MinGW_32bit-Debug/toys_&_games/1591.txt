 I have used this game with many groups of 5th graders as a fun activity in conjunction with their study about the states. Kids are actively engaged, using the enclosed map to locate a specific state, reading cards to learn the state's capital, nickname...After a few playing sessions, students become more proficient in knowing the state's location and it's capital. Each time the game is played, there's a different outcome, unlike a typical board game where everyone follows the same path. The playing cards duplicate the same quirky, whimsical illustrations from Laurie Keller's "Scrambled States of America" book. The game is fast-paced (avg playing time about 10-15 mins)and students love it SO much that they often want to stay in during recess to play some more!
