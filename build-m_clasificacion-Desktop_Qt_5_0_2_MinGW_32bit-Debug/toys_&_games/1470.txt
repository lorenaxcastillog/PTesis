 I've been playing Scrabble for almost 2 years now, and I profess to completely know only the 2 and 3 letter words. Scrabble really expands your vocabulary, but DON'T expect it to use them in daily life, or more commonly, not know the meaning at all. You see, to achieve Scrabble 'cramming', top players rarely, if ever memorise the word meanings. They memorise them for utility. So while you may triumph in many a word game, it will not significantly improve your English. In fact, the 2003 world champion Panupol Sujjayakorn has admitted that his English is still poor in spite of what must be a massive vocabulary numbering over a million. I highly recommend one of the Scrabble dictionaries, to cut out those niggly disputes when a person invents and insists that a word exists. I myself use the Collins 2005 edition. Among word games, this is king. Just don't waste all your time memorising words - there are better things to do out there. Really :)
