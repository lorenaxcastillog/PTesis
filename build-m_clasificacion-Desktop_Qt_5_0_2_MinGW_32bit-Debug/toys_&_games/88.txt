 As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great. After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it. Think about a small child wetting a sponge. It ends up a dripping mess! Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc. We're good about watching the kids, too. You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it. The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days. Just a very disappointing gift. Fisher Price should have stuck with the original Doodle Pro... my kids have had it for a year and still use it
