 This kit is very poorly detailed, and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close. There's a MUCH better model of an X-Wing out there. Do a web search for a company called "Fine Molds"... it's a Japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale X-Wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures, including parts to build different ships from the original film's Death Star battle, including standing & seated pilot figures & different droid types. It's a bit more expensive than this kit, but you get what you pay for.
