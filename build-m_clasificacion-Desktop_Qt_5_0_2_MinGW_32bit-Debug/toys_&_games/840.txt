 This is one of the best DVD games there is! i totally reccomend this game for everyone, including kids. Kids and adults will have bunches of fun playing the game, but to have even more fun, just make a deal with the other team and say "Best two out of three games is the champion!!" because this Family Feud game is very short but fun. One of the lamest questions they asked team B was: "What famous man has sideburns?" and our family was puzzled. Of course, who could of thought of Abraham Lincoln??!! But although it is short it is one of the COOLEST games out there!! Trust me, it's an addictive game! Pretty soon at your party and the next day someone will say, "Hey, guys, wanna play Family Feud again?" Have fun and be sure to buy this!!!!!!!!!It's a great dvd game!!!!!! AND it works on my laptop!!!!!!
