 I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this game after reading some of the negative comments, but since my wife & I are big fans of the show, I decided to take a chance. We purchased two games, one for our daughter & her husband and one for us. We have enjoyed this game and have had no problems with the game "freezing". The DVD game is a lot slower than the actual show and the makers could have made it more user friendly. It is a little tedious having to scroll through the cases but it's still a fun game to play.
