 This is a great set. But I don't have this set, however, this is because I don't buy "Holiday" trains sets, because I like buying train sets that I can play with all year. Lionel makes high quality sets, this set is good for kids and adults. The high quality locomotive, the Berkshire 2-8-0, has been in production since the 1950's and is probably Lionel's best model. Pros: Lionel Quality Runs in forward-neutral-reverse Smokes Whistle There is a switch to turn the smoke off, as well as one to keep the train in forward-neutral-reverse 3 rails is fine O-27 track is good for tight spaces Roadbed lets you lay track on carpet Durable Cons: MTH makes better trainsets at a more reasonable price Expensive Might not be a prefered set for all year round Some people can't stand the smell the smoke makes Some people may be annoyed by the whistle SOME may NOT prefer 3 rails If the smoke unit is on you have to make sure smoke fluid is in the smoke unit or it will burn out Smoke fluid MAY leak out if deraile
