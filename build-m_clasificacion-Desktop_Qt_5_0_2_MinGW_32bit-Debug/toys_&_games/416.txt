 I received this Ty pig as a baby shower gift. My son "discovered" it when he was 18 months old and it's his dearest companion besides his "night-night." Piggy must go for car rides, eat with him, get jammies on and go to the Dr. to have his temperature checked. We love Piggy because when he's covered with milky Cheerios, we can just throw him in the washer and dryer. He's good as new in about an hour. Who wouldn't love that? It's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites. We love it and my son loves it. Now we ordered a spare Piggy so that there is a Piggy substitute when Piggy is bathing. Enjoy your toddler
