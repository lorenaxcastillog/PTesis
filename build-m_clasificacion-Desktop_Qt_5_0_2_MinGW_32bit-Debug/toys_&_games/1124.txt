 I got a Pogo Roo for Christmas around 1991. My parents were not sure whether I would like it or not. I played with that pogo stick more than anything I else for the next few years. I spent most of Christmas day trying to see how many jumps in a row I could get. I used this same pogo stick for years, bouncing down the street to my friends' houses. I started doing tricks like no hands and 360's by about 4th grade. The spring broke sometime around 1998 but it still worked pretty good. I finally threw it away when I was in 17 in 2001 after 10 years and millions of bounces
