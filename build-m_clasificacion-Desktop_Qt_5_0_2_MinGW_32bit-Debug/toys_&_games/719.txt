 My son (5) received this for Christmas and it's been a huge hit! My younger son (3) is constanly begging to play with it. My nephew (2) and husband play with it as well. This toy spans all ages. It's much bigger then the regular T-Rex by Imaginext but still has all the same great safety features such as fierce looking teeth without being sharp. The animatronic movements and sounds are pretty cool and justify the pricetag since this toy is rarely left alone. A great addition to the Imaginext prehistoric line. Now all I have to do is buy a couple more.
