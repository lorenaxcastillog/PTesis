 I played this game one on one with another person and we had a fairly good time. Even though we could not answer over half the questions, they were multiple choice and we learned a lot. But once we took the game to a party with about 6 players, the game lost its luster. Not only did we all not know the answers to most of the questions, we weren't guessing correctly either. Couple that with the fact it seemed forever before it was your turn again, the game was a flop. Maybe if we played in teams it would have been better, but it just didn't work out for a group
