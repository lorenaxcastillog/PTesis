 After reading the reviews here I figured it was worth taking a chance for the price. Most of the time all mine did was slop a lot of solution everywhere. Sometimes it would make one bubble that would float a couple feet & die. I would advise caution in one respect if you do decide to buy one of these. The bubbles consist of a lot of solution & one popped on my 4 year old nephew & he got it in his eyes which stung enough to make him cry. The lack of it creating bubbles was even more disappointing to him. Personally I don't think there are any good bubble makers out there. The latest toy I bought for my nephew starts out fun but ends up making a huge mess after about 10 minutes of using it
