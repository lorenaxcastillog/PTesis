 I bought this last year for my son for Christmas. I didn't buy the PVD's until some time later, because all of the age appropriate titles or the ones he would like were sold out everywhere. (He is now 7)Anyway, by the time I finally got him some PVD's, the system, although it had been unopened until that time, did not work. Occasionally I would hear sound, but I never saw a picture. I was very disappointed and since I had purchased it quite a while before we used it, I didn't bother trying to return it. I gave in and bought a Video Now FX player today, so I am hoping that we have better results with this one
