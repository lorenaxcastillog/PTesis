 My son and I had a blast opening the geodes and finding the crystals inside. You must use an old sock and a hammer to break them open (yes, the sock will have holes in it when you are done). When we opened the box I was surprised to see how little the stones were, but they really pack the crytals! All the rocks in our box had crystals. It made learning fun as I explained to him how geodes are created. Kids that are into hands-on science stuff will just love these. Not only are these worth the money for memory making, they make great keepsakes for the treasure box, too
