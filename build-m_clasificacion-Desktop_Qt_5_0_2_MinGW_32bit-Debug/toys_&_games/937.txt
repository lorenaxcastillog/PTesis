 This is a wonderful toy for learning many beginning math concepts. At first glance you don't realize how much learning these little gingerbread people can inspire. There are a multitude of ways to sort and pattern with these. I bought them for my 2 1/2 year old, but my 7 year old loves them just as much. There is a short learning guide that comes with them with some great ideas for other activities. I worked with my youngest for about 15 minutes with these and in that amount of time we sorted them about 4 different ways, counted different sets and patterned. As a teacher and a mother, these should be in every child's playroom! I even bought a set for my morning kdg. class
