 I highly recommend this Spongebob cartridge for the Leapster system! My little boy is a big spongebob fan and on Christmas morning he got from Santa a leapster and some Leapster games, of course Spongebob is one of his favorites. My little boy is almost 4 and he completely understands each game included on the spongebob cartridge and in the 3 months we have had this game he is already going to higher levels with the game. It teaches while letting your child have fun and that is what is the most important, if your child is having fun while learning they will continue to keep learning! This spongebob cartridge teaches the values of money, colors, music game and more. The voices sound the same as on the cartoon and it keeps my little boy intrested in playing it still after 3 months he plays this game on a daily basis! I would suggest this leapster cartridge for all
