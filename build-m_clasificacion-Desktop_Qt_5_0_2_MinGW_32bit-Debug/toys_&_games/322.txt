 I purchased this pirate ship for my son's fourth birthday. This is by far the most popular toy in our house! My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy. There are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls, swords, treasure chest full of goodies, food, animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. My four year old plays on his own, or with his friends, and when all three are home they all play together. Definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home!
