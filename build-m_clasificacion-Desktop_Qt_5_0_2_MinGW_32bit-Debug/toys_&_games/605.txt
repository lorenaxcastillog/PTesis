 It's the game of *sweet revenge*. Who wouldn't like this came, a game that as been played for decades and decades. I remember sitting in our sunny sunroom with my brother playing when we were both children, I am now a mother and a Family Daycare provider and my son (6 yrs) and the children I care for enjoy playing. After school my son and the older children run and get a game to play instead of turning on the tv and 7 times out of 10 they pick Sorry. This game can be played by children as young as 3 or 4 yrs and children that are as young as 101.This is a game everyone should own!!! I think I am going to go now, get my son and have a game of Sorry
