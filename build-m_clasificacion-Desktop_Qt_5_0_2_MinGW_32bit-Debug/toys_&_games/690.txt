 First off, this thing is truly the greatest toy my daughter has ever had. She got it for her first birthday, and loves it. Having said that--how about putting some kind of a brake on this thing? She's just starting to walk, and she's climbing all over it. It would be great if it could stay in one place solidly. Also, why doesn't this one have the safety straps, like the Pathfinder does? But really, this thing is amazing. I'm more hoping that the company will read this and add some braking system, than trying to discourage parents from buying it. Heck, all I have to do is put a stick under the tire and it holds still just fine, I just think it'd be better with a simple brake. It is a safe, tough, well built wagon. I liked this one best.
