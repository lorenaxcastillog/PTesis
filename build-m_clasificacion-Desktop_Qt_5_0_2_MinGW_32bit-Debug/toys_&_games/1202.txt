 This is a tile game based in the Middle Ages when there were walled cities in Europe. Carcassonne is in southern France, but we've stayed in a similar German city -- Dinkelsbuehl. Grandpa got it for a Christmas present in 2005 and since then we've bought extension sets and played it with the adult children. Somewhere along the way, the grandchildren (ages 5-9) discovered this was a game they could play with the adults and so we gave the game to two families this Christmas. The grandkids love playing with the grown-ups and don't have to understand the strategy in order to enjoy playing and sometimes to win. The game goes faster than others we play like Settlers of Catan and Rail Baron
