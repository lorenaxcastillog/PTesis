 My son had a great time playing in this pool. I bought this item when he was 7 months old, and now he's almost 11 months old and still enjoys playing with all of the inflatable extras that the pool comes with. Every time he pelts one of the stars on the rainbow bar, the bells inside jingle--which he thinks is fabulous! The side poles that hold the colorful rings squeak when you squeeze them, so he has a good time gripping them just to hear them deflate. It's an overall safe toy that your child can enjoy as long as they are supervised, of course. The only difficulty I had was inflating the pool itself. Blowing it up would have taken forever, and using a bike pump would be a workout. Just find one of your buddies with the industrial pump in their garage or take it to the local gas station and it will take less than a minute--it's way easier
