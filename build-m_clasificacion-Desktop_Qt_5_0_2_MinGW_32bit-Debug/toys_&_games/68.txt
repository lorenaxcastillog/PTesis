 Unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including Mr. Do and do it right- the classic collections on PlayStation II are the best. Unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play. The monsters in the Pac-Man games are almost always on kill including following you in the tunnel a lot of the time. The problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate. Galaga was better and Mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history. But again it's better to get the collections for Playstation II
