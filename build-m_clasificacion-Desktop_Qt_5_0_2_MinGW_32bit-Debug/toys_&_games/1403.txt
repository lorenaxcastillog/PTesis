 This globe is a "blow up" globe that can be reused again and again. It easily folds up and can be carried in a pocket. It is made of tough beach ball material. I bought it to take to a farming village in the jungle in northeast Luzon in the Philippines, and there was no way I had room for a regular globe in my luggage. This blow up globe was perfect for the long, rough trip. I used it to show the people I was visiting where I live, and where their village is, because they had never seen a map before. The globe was useful for showing where the typhoons that hit their village come from, how close the Philippines is to other countries, and whatnot. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the individual US states are not shown on the map of the US, so I had to draw in California with a ball point pen. Otherwise, this globe is a real handy, portable teaching tool. It also comes with a repare kit in case you pop it
