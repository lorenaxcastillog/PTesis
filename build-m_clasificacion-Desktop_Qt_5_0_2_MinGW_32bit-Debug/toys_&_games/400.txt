 I bought this for my son for Christmas, which at the time he was only 14 months old. The age says from 18 months. The problem is he can't hold the button down to make it go so I have to walk around the train and hold the button for him. We had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down either. Overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him. Also, this toy is cheaper at Toys-R-Us. I got ours when it was on sale for $[...]. After Christmas they had them on sale half off for $[...]
