 But I like Sasha and Jade better. She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute! Her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow "stone" in the middle. Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them. Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy her
