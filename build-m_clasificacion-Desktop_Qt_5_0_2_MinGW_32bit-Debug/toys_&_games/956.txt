 We bought this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter to store an assortment of Barbie items we inherited. The divided lid is great for tiny objects like shoes, perfume bottles etc. and stays closed surprisingly well even while it is being slammed open and shut to reach the items inside the case. The case stores Barbies upright which keeps hair from getting tangled etc. The clear case is great for seeing what is inside and the wheels and handle are convenient for our daughter. We weren't sure what to expect as far as quality, but for a plastic case and the money we paid, we think it is a great buy
