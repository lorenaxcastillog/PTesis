 I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly. This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each bug has a magnet on it, and the players are given a "butterfly net" with a magnet hanging from it to use to draw the pieces out of the puzzle. One of our pieces did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy
