 My daughter received these for her 1st birthday. She loved them immediately, and particularly enjoyed the bucket they came in. She would fill and empty the bucket, over and over again, putting the lid on, taking it back off, trying other toys to see if they fit (your ball is too big! But look, the block fits inside!), putting the beads into other containers... you get the picture. She learned a lot from these beads. Now, at 15 months, she has just started being able to snap them together, and is getting a whole new experience with them. These are one of the first toys she pulls out of her play bin every day, and they get played with throughout the day until it's time to put the toys to bed. While I agree that these beads are heavy, I find that they stay together without a problem (but aren't hard for her to pull apart, either). To me, they feel like good quality toys, and you won't find them denting easily like cheaper snap-beads. I highly recommend this toy for a toddler
