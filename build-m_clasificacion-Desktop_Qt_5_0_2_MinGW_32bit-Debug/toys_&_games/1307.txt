 This is my kids favorit game, and my favorit to play with them. It goes fast and you can stop at any time. You don't have to sit around wating for your turn and you don't have to remind your kids that it is there turn. Every one plays at the same time. It can get a little loud with all the shouting. It is a realy easy concept to understand. My 6 year old can play it just fine. It is best to play with at least four people. I love the fact that this game is almost 100 years old. You know it must be good if it's still around
