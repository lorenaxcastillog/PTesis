 I really wanted to like this game, but there are serious problems with the version that comes in the blue box. 1. The pegs fall out of the vertical board. This is a serious game play issue because you cannot tell where you have fired or scanned. 2. The voice is VERY difficult to understand. I cannot emphasize this enough...DO NOT buy the version in the blue box. It stinks. I was able to contact Hasbro (not an easy feat because their phone line is CONSTANTLY busy, you have to wait on hold for about ten minutes and their operators hung up on me twice [accidentally I hope] before I got to speak to them), and they sent me an entirely new unit in the green box. BUY the version in the green box; it is great (just don't use it in the elevated mode; keep it flat on the table)
