 My kids really enjoy playing the Candy Land DVD game. There are 3 different games to play and you can play for fun or play to win on each game. With kids running and bouncing around, I really like the fact that the mats pretty much stay put on the carpet. Unlike other games, the kids are not slipping and sliding or falling down on the mats. I believe this game is rated for ages 4 and up, but I think that most 2 and 3 year old kids could play most of the games if not all of the games. My son is 2 and he can play all of the games (we have to help him a bit of the 'Mister Mint says' game though)
