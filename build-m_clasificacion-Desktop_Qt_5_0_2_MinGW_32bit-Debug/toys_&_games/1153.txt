 Sorry folks this one is a pain to figure out before getting knocked out by a flying plastic disc with scratch prone edges. Great for taking out an eye or blinding the user permanently. NOT suggested for kids without protective face gear and an interpretor of the directions wlll need to be present at all times. Parents will be spending more time with it than the kids trying to get it to work properly. My 6 year old was done with it as soon as I figured it out. the upside At least we spent more time together reading and doing crazy moves
