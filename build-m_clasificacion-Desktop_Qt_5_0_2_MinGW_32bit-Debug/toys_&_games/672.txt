 We bought this set over a year ago and my daughter is still carrying it with her everywhere. Most marker sets you find in stores only have 24 or 36 colors. Here you have 100 colors to choose from. They come in a zippered case that opens into a full circle of markers arrayed in a beautiful rainbow. Each marker pops into the case so they all have a place and you can instantly see if one is missing. The markers have withstood endless pictures but are now getting a bit dry so we are replacing them. For $15 it seriously may be the #1 value of all the toys we have ever purchased for our children over the years.
