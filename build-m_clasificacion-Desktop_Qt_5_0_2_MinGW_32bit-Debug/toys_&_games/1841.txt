 My doll Suzie is so great! She is like two dolls in one. I like to take care of her as a baby, then watch her grow, and take care of her as a little girl. I enjoy how nicely she's designed. She has the cutest voice, and laughs so adorably. Suzie doesn't work very well if her big girl panties are over the buttons on her stomach that you squiz to hug her. I have to have the panties low down on her belly. If I don't do that, and have her panties high, she becomes erresponsive. That's no problem for me, though. I like her clothes and her hair. They are so cute! She makes me smile every time I wake her up. My friend who doesn't like dolls actually liked this one. I gave her five stars because she delights everyone around me. It makes me feel good that I actually have something that many other people like. I think Suzie is my favorite doll!
