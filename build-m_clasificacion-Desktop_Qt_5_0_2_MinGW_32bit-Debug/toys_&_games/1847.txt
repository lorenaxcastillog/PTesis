 We gave this to my son on his 1st birthday in January, even after I read some reviewers complaints about the balls being hard to pound through. But I thought it looked interesting, so we tried it anyway. Yes, the balls are too hard for a 1 year old to pound through. My solution was to use a utility knife to carve down the small bumps in the ball holes so it was easy for him to pound them in with the palm of his hand. Mind you, this took me all of 2 minutes to do. He loved it then and he loves it still. He plays with this toy several times a week even after 9 months.
