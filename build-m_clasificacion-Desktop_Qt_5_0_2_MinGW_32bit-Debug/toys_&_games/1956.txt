 We bought this for our 1-year-old daughter, and although she can't do all of the activities, she loves to try! This is one of her favorite toys to have in her crib, and she is playing with 1 out of 2 mornings when I go to her room to get her up in the morning. One review said that you can make this on your own. I agree, to an extent. I *could* make this, but by the time I had gotten everything to look as nice and be as high a quality, I would have spent hours and hours and a lot more money on materials than just buying it. My daughter loves it, and I am extremely pleased with it
