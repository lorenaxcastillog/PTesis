 I love the fact that this calculator puts the equations in the form they are learning in school. You actually get to see the equation, not just the answer. AND it shows the dividing "bridge" in division, not the dash with dots over/under it. I think it helps my son see the equations in a form that is meaningful because it's how his teacher does it & how it is on his homework. He's 6 & thinks it is fun to just sit around & practice with equations, testing himself before he hits equal for the answer. Glad I bought it
