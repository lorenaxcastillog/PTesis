 I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas. Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters. There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining. I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too. Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary. I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it. In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it
