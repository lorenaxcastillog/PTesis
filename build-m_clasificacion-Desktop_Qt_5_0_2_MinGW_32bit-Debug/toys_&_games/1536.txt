 These rings are a good concept, but the weights on them aren't heavy enough to keep them in place. As the kids swim through them they sort of hop along with the current (from the kids swimming). When I was a child... I had a set that was just like hula hoops on a length of rope tied to a small case. The case was filled with sand and stayed put as you swam through them. My friends and I spent hours setting up courses we could race through. This set is nice because it does fold up and fit in a small mesh bag for transporting to the pool. But, if you have your own pool you might want to look for a set like I had way back when.......
