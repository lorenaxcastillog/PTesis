 i bought this version of the Batmobile instead of the RC version because it was not as pricey and didn't require a separately-purchased, expensive battery. this version is a great Batmobile. the electronic lights and sounds are cool, the rockets hide great inside the chassis, everything looks great. it's great to roll across the floor and startle any sleeping pets. the only problem? the Battle Gear Batman figure i have DOES NOT fit in the cockpit. the cockpit is way too small, requiring you to bend and jam your Batman action figure's limbs and trying unsuccessfully to force it into the cockpit seat, and even then it doesn't fit. i like to take care of my things, since i see them more as collector's items rather than toys. i wanted this Batmobile to be a safe place for my Batman figure, which normally lies out in the open. so unfortunately, this is a big disappointment. oh well, the rest of the Batmobile looks great
