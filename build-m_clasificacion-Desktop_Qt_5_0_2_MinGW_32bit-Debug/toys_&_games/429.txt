 This is a great Barney musical songbook, and can also be used as a play piano. It's great that it has an auto turn off, after non-use. However, if it is turned off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by itself. Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it turns on by itself. Because the Songbook does not have a physical turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep. Just wish it has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally. Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it
