 I recently gave this car as a birthday gift to a four year old boy in my home daycare. He loves it so much! It is very detailed and yet still very rugged. He has had two problems with it but an older child would have more patience. It's difficult getting his Batman to sit all the way down in the seat. And unless he's all the way down, the top won't close and has popped off (it looks difficult to pop off, but this kid has done it). It's easy for an adult to pop back on. The second issue has been getting the arrows that shoot out back into the guns. You have to rotate them until they pop in. These are pretty minor problems if you have a child with a little patience and the overall quality far outweighs these issues
