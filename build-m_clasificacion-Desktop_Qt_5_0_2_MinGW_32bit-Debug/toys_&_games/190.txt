 I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She played the sound game. She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect. The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing. Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun. After trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was, she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again. I took the thing back to the store and got a refund
