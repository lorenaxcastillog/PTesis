 We got a tub of these legos two Christmases ago for our 2 daughters, then ages 1 and 3. Our only complaint was that even 140 pieces isn't enough! We got another tub the next year, and are getting one again this year because they are the best toy our children have! We debated over whether to get the Duplos again or try the regular Legos, but decided to go ahead and get one more tub of Duplos, because our now-5 yr. old still loves them. The newer colors are fun (Lego added orange, light green, and light blue to the standard red, yellow, blue, and green), as well as the addition of skinny blocks. Definitely a great buy for kids (and grown-ups) of any age
