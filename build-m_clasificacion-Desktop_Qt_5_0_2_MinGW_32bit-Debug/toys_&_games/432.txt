 I give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons: first, humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus, and second, the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set. My mother sent this toy as a gift for my son's first birthday. The package suggests this toy for ages 2-5, and in typical fashion, my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself, but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy. She began role-playing with the dinosaurs right away. "I love you very much," said the mama dinosaur to her baby. Supercute
