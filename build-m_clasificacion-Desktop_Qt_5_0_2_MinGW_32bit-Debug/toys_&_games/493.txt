 It is really expensive for what it is. I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it. I love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf. However, for the supplies you get it IS expensive. The tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10. However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make great gifts
