 Actually, we love the game very much but are very disappointed with Pressman Toys. Here's the scoop: our game came with only 20 pegs of each color -- the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color. We've called the company 1800 800-0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs. Just bad business practice in my opinion. As the saying goes, when you love something you tell a few people, when you're not happy you tell everyone. I'll be sure to check that I'm not buying items from Pressman Toys next time. So instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we'll just have to win in fewer steps. SIGH!
