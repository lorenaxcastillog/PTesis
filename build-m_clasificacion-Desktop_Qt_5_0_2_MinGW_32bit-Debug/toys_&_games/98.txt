 We have two new power wheels 12 volt batteries. They take a charge just fine with the charger that came with them. I bought this so we could use it as a rapid charger and it would take less time for the batteries to charge. I plugged them in and waited a few seconds. Both batteries had the flashing red indicating the batteries were either a wrong battery or bad. This will not charge the batteries for me. All it does is sit there and blink red. But the batteries charge just fine with the original charger. How can they be bad batteries if they hold a charge and we get hours of play out of them on a full charge. Funny that. Makes me wonder if it is a marketing ploy for people to run right out and buy a new $50 battery to replace the "bad" one. If it would actually work to charge the battery then it would be great. But we cannot get past the red light with ours. It is going right back to the store!!! It might be slower but we will stick with our original charger from now on.
