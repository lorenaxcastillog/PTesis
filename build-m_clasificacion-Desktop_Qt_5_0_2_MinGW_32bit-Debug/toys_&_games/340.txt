 This is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now. Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it. This brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great. This toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price. I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series. Not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah) but it also helps built their imagination as I hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs. Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that TRU has a limited selection).
