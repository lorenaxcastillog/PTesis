 This is a very very difficult toy to maintain. Gravel is extremely difficult to remove and clean without getting the cardboard background wet. After one cleaning the cardboard background gets wet and that's the end of that. The plastic scratches very easily and pieces of the periscope broke off easily as well. Goldfish need lots of water and this doesn't lend itself to many types of fish. I have never had such a difficult time trying to maintain the integrity of the toy while trying to keep fish alive and the tank clean as well. NOT recommended at all. Save your money for a "real" tank
