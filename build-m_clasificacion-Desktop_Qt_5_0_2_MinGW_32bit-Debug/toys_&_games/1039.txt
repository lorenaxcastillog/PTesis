 I purchased this case to store my son's Little Touch Leap Pad books and cartridges in but they did not fit. The case is much bigger than I thought it would be but it still does not fit the Little Touch Leap Pad itself in there. My son just got the My First Leap Pad for Christmas and this one DOES fit in there. I am glad we found a use for it or I would be sending it back for a refund. Make sure you know which system you will be using it for before purchasing to make sure it will fit
