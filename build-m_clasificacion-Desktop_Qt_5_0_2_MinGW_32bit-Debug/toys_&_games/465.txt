 I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas. On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit. It was an instant hit! As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter. Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving. Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt. What an awesome gift
