 We got this for my son and he loves it! This was bought because I loved the design of it and paid the extra for the step2 name and awesome design! I now wish I would have just stuck with our little tikes imaginesounds playhouse though. I have tried to order replacement stickers for this and am unable to, so the doorbell is faded and stove stickers about missing, rain comes in and sets on stove and sink area. My son still loves it but I like my toys to be clean and new looking. He is 3 now and has had it about a year, he enjoys running in and out pretending with the phone
