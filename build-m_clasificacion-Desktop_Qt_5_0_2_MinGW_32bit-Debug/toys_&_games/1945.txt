 My 6-year old son received the VideoNow XP for his 6th birthday from my sister. She also bought him the Scooby Doo interactive movie. He enjoys the movie, but gets frustrated with getting past each point. Overall he enjoys his new toy. My frustration, however, is that I have looked online for more videos, and it shows them, but says they are currently unavailable. That I have seen for the past few weeks. Target has a very limited number of the PVD's and most I don't feel are appropriate for my six year old ie, the older kid shows. I would like to see more educational interactive movies, because after getting through the Scooby show, I think my son has become bored with it..............
