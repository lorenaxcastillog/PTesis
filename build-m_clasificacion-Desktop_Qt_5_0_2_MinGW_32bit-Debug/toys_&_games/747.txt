 I bought this game for my 15 year old for christmas and she loves it. It has different levels and modes of play and lots of interesting pirate lore. Every game is just a little different so it isn't just going around the same game board again and again. The playing pieces are made of metal, the dice are wood, and the treasures gleam enticingly. The cloth playing "board" has the look and feel of an old world chart. Playing the game is fun because you never know what turn the dice will take, and what fate the seas have in store for you. This game is perfect for pirate enthusiasts, young and old
