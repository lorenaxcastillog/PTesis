 I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She is now a year old and has loved this toy from the first day she got it. When she first got the toy she would pull the animals off of their little stools. Now she pushes the buttons to make sounds. She has also started pushing the tractor around the house. She enjoys listening to the animal sounds and music. I don't think she will get tired of this toy for some time since she still needs to learn how to build the blocks and pretend play. It is still the first toy she grabs when she wakes up in the morning. This is a great toy and my husband and I enjoy it as well
