 My two year old is a new fan of Dora, so I bought her this beach set as a stocking stuffer. To say she loves it would be an understatement. We have many Dora toys now, but the little Dora and Boots figurines in this set are particularly loved. What's nicest about them is that they are small enough for her to hold in one hand, and so are very portable. They are also hard molded plastic, so while they aren't poseable, they also aren't breakable and are extremely easy to clean. She can bring them in the bathtub, to bed, play with them at meals and in the sandbox. I can wash them in super hot soapy water unlike the stuffed toys we own. The paint has held up well to wear. I ended up buying another one of these sets as a backup, in case one gets lost, and a different set to get the Tico character
