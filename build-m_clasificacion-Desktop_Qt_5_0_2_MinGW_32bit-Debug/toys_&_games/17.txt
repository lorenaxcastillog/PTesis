 I purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr. old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have. He was very excited about having his "own" coffee maker, however after only a few days it quit working. The lights and sound still work but the water won't run anymore, he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy. He still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so I will probably not return it because I think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water doesn't work!
