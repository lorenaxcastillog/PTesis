 This action figure is sitting on my desk at home. He's my little computer buddy. It's really not bad at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple of humourous pics. It's great. All hail Sephi!! (and you can just hear it, Why the heck are you calling me that? Well, why not? It's weird and it's not right! But, Sephi....) Hahahaha. Can't wait to get Cloud too. Then things in my house will be interesting
