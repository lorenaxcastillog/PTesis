 Even though I'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations, this model has treated us well. We got this monitor (with dual receivers) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear & crisp. Reception was perfect in the basement, in the frontyard, in the backyard...even at the neighbor's house. One of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one. The second receiver finally stopped working last week & after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research, I decided to go with the same, trusty, inexpensive monitor and it works great! I've never slept with a monitor in our room (because our babies stay with us for a long time) so I don't know about nighttime quirks. I keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps....and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me. :) Baby #3 is on the way & I'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we don't need it anymore. So, $40 over the course of 3 children isn't bad!
