 My friend got Hoppers as a birthday present and we all played it. It was really fun and it got more challenging as we went on. What you do is: You pick a card and place the frogs on the pgs of what the picture shows on the card. Then you take one frog and jump it over one. The one that it jumped over, take it off the peg. The object it to have 1 frog remaining. It is very educational because you have to think when you play it. It is very durable because there is a pull out drawer under it that you store the frogs and the cards in. It's a great game that you can play in the car, especially for long vacations. Hoppers is hours of fun for everyone
