 The time tracker is a great idea, however, we've found it works best if you program it manually. It works well for keeping the kids on task while eating their breakfast in the mornings before school and for timing video game play. I also bought the ac adapter, but without the batteries it's sort of flimsy, and if you unplug it (which is easy to do, esp. if the kids pick it up) you have to reprogram everything. (and it's not as if it's in constant use except as a clock) We've found that that since our kids are 6 & 4 the concept of time is foreign, this way it warns them when they have a minute or so left to play and it seems to cure the disappointment of turning off the t.v. etc..
