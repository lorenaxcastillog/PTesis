 Assembled, this toy is very pretty. Especially when all of the dolls (sold separately) are posed on it. It's VERY cute! However,the design/quality is very poor. Mattel needs to keep in mind that parents sometimes need to relocate or store a toy, and this playset cannot be moved without falling completely apart. It falls apart when it's played with too. Also, the backdrop is made out of cardboard. CARDBOARD! It doesn't attach firmly and keeps falling off. I don't think Mattel bothers to test market their toys with actual children anymore. If they did, they would know this needed more work before release. I guess it's cheaper to rush a toy to market before Christmas than to perfect and produce a quality product. If I had been able to examine one of these playsets before purchasing, I wouldn't have purchased it
