 I bought this game for my 18 month old son. He loves the Goodnight Moon book. The game has blown up pictures from in the book made into cards that he can match to a board. There is also a large board picture to match the pictures on the card. This game is easy to modify and use with younger children or with only one child. My 18 month old has been successful with matching to the boards. As his skills improve he will be able to play the more challenging versions of the game. The company is also willing to ship lost pieces for a minimal charge. This guarantees the game will stay intact
