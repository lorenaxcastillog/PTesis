 We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. We turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out. We thought it was just a case of dead batteries, so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad. When trying to get it replaced, we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead. Needless to say, our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere, ever. We'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music
