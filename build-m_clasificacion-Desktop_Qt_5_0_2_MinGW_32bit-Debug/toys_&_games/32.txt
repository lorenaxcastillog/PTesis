 This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor. It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it. The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does. The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away. I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it
