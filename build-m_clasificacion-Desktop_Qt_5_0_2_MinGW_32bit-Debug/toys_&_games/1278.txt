 We have a large group of friends that gets together on a regular basis and our usual game of choice is the 80's or 90's Game! We play 'guys against girls', and usually we make the guys answer the 80's questions and the girls answer the 90's questions. (I think the 80's questions are a little harder just because you have to think back another whole decade!) If you have a lucky roller you can really get ahead in the game using the "free jump". Also, if the guys land on sports questions too much they usually end up beating the girls. The best part about these games is that the questions aren't too serious or too impossible like Trivial Pursuit. If you lived in the 80's or 90's, you should know the answers - the hard (but fun) part is just trying to remember! Ladies, do you remember the song that Joey McIntyre (former NKOTB) came out with solo in 1999? I recommend buying both games - its fun to intermix the questions! FUN, FUN, FUN
