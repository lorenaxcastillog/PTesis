 This toy has inspired me to write my first review. If I could have rated this a "0" I would have done so. It's absolutely horrible. Learning Curve should be ashamed of the extrememly poor workmanship on this toy. What makes it all the more frustrating is that my grandson loves the concept and wants to play with the toy - but even at 5 years of age he is unable to manage all of the problems. For goodness sakes, Bob himself couldn't handle this project! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Also, as noted in an earlier review - the chainsaw deal has all the same problems so don't buy it either. Very disappointing
