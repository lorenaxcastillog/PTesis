 I'm just ordering our third set of these for my daughter (8), my sons (ages 6,4,2) and my husband(an engineer). They play with them nearly constantly and the range of creations possible is nearly infinite. We are a family that enjoys construction/building toys and have dozens of different sets.. I'd say Superstructs has reigned as #1 since we got them last year. They are less breakable than Tinker Toys (no splinters!), and hold up really well to everything but being chewed by our boxer dog, so a very sturdy and well made toy. Great for getting children to think outside the box and a very fine multi use toy. We've seen airplanes, cars, trucks, buildings, dolls, robots, aliens, strollers, pretend hats.. you name it. The mark of a truly great toy is that it can be played with in many ways. Superstructs is such a toy. Buy it, play with it, and enjoy
