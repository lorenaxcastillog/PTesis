 My 3 year old daughter is a huge fan of Paz and she really likes to draw, so I figured this was a no brainer. She does enjoy using it, but there are some drawbacks. The light from the projector is not very bright. If you try to use regular printer paper it is hard to see the object being illuminated. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm hoping tracing paper will work better. The other major drawback is that it collapses easily. In order to use it, you must lean the two sections together. Unfortunately they don't lock into each other, they just sort of balance on each other. So if you try to move it or push on it a little too hard it will collapse. Even so, she loves to draw with the markers, calling herself "the artist". The chalkboard side is a hit too. Overall I would suggest this toy
