 I purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at Amazon, it looked also like a fun toy with educational value. I am very disappointed. For starters, my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes, face & hat can only go on in one order. He also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together, and he is very dextrous for his age. Also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in. Without this, the blocks are loose in my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces. The packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. All in all, it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance, as I had thought it might be. When he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else. We could have done without this toy under our Christmas tree
