 i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime! i play with the products more than the store.i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff. i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would NOT buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead.im 11 yrs ol
