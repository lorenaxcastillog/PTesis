 I had bought this climber for my daughter before reading the posts about how hard it is to put together. I am glad I did as this has been a great toy and went together pretty smoothly. The only parts that were in ANY way difficult to put together were putting the slides in place (especially the longer one), and the header over the longer slide. Otherwise, this was NO problem. Of all the toys I've put together this would fall into the easiest 1/4th and the kids LOVE it. Also, the toy held up just fine with over 400lbs on it (my brother-in-law and myself). I don't know how people can be concerned over its sturdiness as the limits are pretty clear on the deck. 100lb limit per child, limit 6 children... 600lbs total!!
