 Why did I wait so long? After months of leap pad books and their cartridges floating all over my son's bedroom floor ~ finally they all have a home. This handy little storage system will hold most children's leap pad library of books and cartridges. It certainly will hold enough to keep your child happy for quite a while. This is perfect to drag along on an adventure. The price is what kept me from buying the storage container when I bought the system. Silly ~ since I have so much more invested in the system and its books. I finally took the plunge and couldn't be happier. Now when we dash off for an adventure ~ everything is ready to go. It is also great as a tool to encourage your child to put everything away when they are done playing with it
