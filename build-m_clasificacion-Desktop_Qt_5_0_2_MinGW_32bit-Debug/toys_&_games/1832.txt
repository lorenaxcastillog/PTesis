 I bought this for my 4-year old son who can already read. He has not stopped playing it for one month now even though he already knows each of the 60 countries and capitals. Because of this game, he has been reading the Atlas and books about children in other countries. I gave this game as a gift to my friends' kids who are between 4 to 8 years old; and they too love the game. I'm sure the game will quickly become boring; but it has done its job of opening up an aspect of learning and an area of interest besides reading, writing and math
