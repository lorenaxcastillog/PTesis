 Bought this and several other Minimates for by son's birthday. As we are huge Lego fans, I thought this would be a great compliment. The "lego-like" bricks are ill fitted, either constantly coming undone or never being able to fit together at all. This caused great frustration and unhappiness. We finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the Batcave or any of the vehicles together. Do not buy. I would like a full refund and an apology from Amazon for carrying such an afwul quaility toy, and from the creator of the Minimates. Ugh
