 We got this for our 1 1/2 yr old and 3 yr old boys for X-Mas. I don't know who loves this car more, the kids or my husband. My favorite feature abou this toy is how the remote control fits into the car and becomes a part of the car when not in use. My toddler loves the carrying handle. We have not experienced any operational problems mentioned in several reviews. On the downside, this car is a little fast for the recommended age group. Our house has an open floor plan so we are not experiencing many crashes. I would not recommend this car if you have tight living quarters. Also, I would recommend keeping your pets out of the way when the car is in use.
