 We bought this item 5 years ago while my son was only 1-1/2 years old, by then he couldn't reach the pedal but wanted to ride on it so bad, since I'm petite (102 lbs.) I drove it around our yard together with my son. It is great! Now my son is already 6 years old and had a little sister (2 years old) they are having fun driving it together. My yard is not smooth, it is gravel driveway but I can say this Gator surpassed my expectation! I noticed the plastic wheels kept spinning on uphill surface but just a little push it works, other than that my son loves driving it in our dirt round-about and it runs fine
