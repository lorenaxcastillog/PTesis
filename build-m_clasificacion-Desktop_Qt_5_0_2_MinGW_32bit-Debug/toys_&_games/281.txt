 I was a bit afraid after reading the reviews, but this game is a hit with kids all ages. It takes about 3 minutes to set up, but it's not hard and the bees don't fall thru. We played more times than I can count this past week, and everyone enjoyed. I bought it for my 5 year old, but her cousins (ages 19, 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually asked to play. My husband and I also got a kick out of it! Even our 3yo loved it, but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped, she's good! Our child didn't get bored while we were setting it back up, but everyone was sticking leaves and talking, so I guess it depends on your children's patience or attention span. In a few words: We all loved it
