 I find this set to be perfect for what we need. Even purchase the extra chairs. At first it was used for coloring. Now that my oldest son is into Thomas the Tank, it serves as a train table. He just started getting into Thomas and he is not interested in making the trains run the whole track yet. Which is good because a whole track set up does not fit on this table. I love that it folds up for easy storage. Yes the chairs are a little hard to fold, but I like that. I can look away for 2 seconds and I can find my 2 boys standing on them, or using them as ladders. I find the table and chairs to be stable.
