 I love these 2 sets of clothes for Ken! Wow! There are two outfits for the office: (1) white shirt, red tie, black pants, black loafers and (2) light blue and white striped shirt , burgundy tie and khaki pants and black loafers. The other two pairs of footwear are blue sandals and white sandals suitable for the beach and hot weather. The other six outfits are casual outfits in cheery colorful designs. Two of the casual tops even have the words "Ken Sport" like a logo. The other two casual tops have the initial "K". It's fun to dress Ken in these new cute outfits
