 Man this game sucks. I LOVE SNL, but the questions here are SO trivial. I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it. It all went downhill from there. I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly. The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective. I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind). He couldn't read the questions on the tv. I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated. Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all! As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board. One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri. Whatever. Game sucks. Costs too much. Stay away
