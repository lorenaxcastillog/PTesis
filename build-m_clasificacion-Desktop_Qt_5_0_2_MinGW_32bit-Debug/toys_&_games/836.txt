 When my daughter opened this on her 1st birthday my immediate thought was - Oh, another keyboard (She got 4 this year). This is one cute toy. It has so many functions that I am sure she will use more and more of as she gets older. It does have a keyboard but also plays individual songs, is a ball drop and teaches cause and effect. Its bright colored and lights up and isnt tooo loud. One HUGE point with me is, it comes with 4 balls. AND its built to STORE the balls when not in use. She has a FisherPrice ball drop toy that the balls are all over our house because there is nowhere to store them. Now granted, my daughter hasnt had this very long so we have not had time to get sick of the main song but so far she really loves it and is exploring all of the different things it does. I believe this toy has staying power. I just wish it was a little sturdier. She tries to pull up on it to put the balls in the top and it topples right over
