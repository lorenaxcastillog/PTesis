 When I was a little girl I stood along beside the table and watched the adults play. This was how I learned how to play the game. I have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above (90's style). Unfortunately, they have changed the style of the cards on us and I would like to purchase the 90's style. If any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that I can buy some. I really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me
