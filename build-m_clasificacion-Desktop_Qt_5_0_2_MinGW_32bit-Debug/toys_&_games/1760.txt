 A first Magic set for my 5 year old, he loves it!! He and his friends have created magic acts for each other and have laughed all the way. The tricks are easy enough for their age to try, and remember how to do. The directions come with pictures, so they can figure them out if the wording is too comlplicated. The set itself is durable enough fot most tricks to be done over and over. The blocks take some reshaping and the rabbit ring trick does not really fit right, but overall, a good first set. It definately was the hit of a rainy Sunday!
