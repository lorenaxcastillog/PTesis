 Now wait a miniute guys. I've had one of these for over a year and I like it. Drop your pocket change in every night and it will sort it just fine. It's not intended for industrial use. It's battery operated and drops your coins into those prefabbed coin rolls. I find that it works 95% of the time. Sure sometimes a coin will get hung up on a wrinkled coin wrapper, but it's an easy fix. The coins top off and the excess drops into a reserve chamber. It's not that hard to tell when the plastic tube is filled to the top. You can get replacement rolls at any business supply store. This thing is 100 times better than sorting by hand. I love it.
