 My six year old daughter received this for her birthday last week. She loves the baby and has enjoyed playing with her in the bathtub. My daughter has not had any problems getting the shower to work. She is able to get quite a bit of water to come out of the shower. I do think however, that the baby does take a long time to dry. I have already noticed that the seams of the baby outfit are starting to rip and we have only had her for a week. She has taken four baths with the baby. I felt that her outfit could be a lot more durable.
