 My daughter has been wanting this item for quite some time, but every time I try to order it, it's never in stock. She completely forgot she even asked for it, because I told her it was impossible to get. At any rate, when she saw what was in the box on Christmas, she was totally surprised and very happy. They've had the ball outside once, and had a fantastic time in it. Due to lots of rain lately they haven't been out again, but love hanging out inside the ball when in the house. So far, indoor or out, this really seems like a great toy. And, since it holds up to 150 lbs, I plan to get in it ASAP
