 It seems like every Christmas there is one toy that is at the top of the list that is a major bust, and this year it is the Love N Licks Puppy!!! This was the only thing my 5 year old daughter really wanted, and she is so disappointed we can't get it to do anything than bark (or whine as it really sounds)! She is sad feeling like it's her fault, like she's not 'loving it enough'. I thought maybe we had just gotten the one lemon, but it looks like they are all like this. I can't believe a manufacturer would put this out and set up so many kids for disappointment. Major disappointment!! Don't waste your money or set your kids up to be extremely disappointed
