 We got one of these as a gift, and couldn't get the back panel for the batteries to open. Tried using a small philips screwdriver, a safety pin, etc., and it simply would not open. The lack of sound was disappointing, though our child still liked the pretty puzzle. We got another battery-activated Melissa & Doug toy that was also a failure -- the "Vehicle Sound Block" toy that is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly. We could get the batteries in, but the toy simply didn't work. No sound, no nothin.' This company seems to do well with plain wood toys, but when they branch out into electronics, the products are fairly shoddy. I plan to avoid their products in the future
