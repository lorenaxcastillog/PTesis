 My four-year old son loves this book. He plays with his LeapPad constantly and is good at changing the books/cartridges by himself. You only need the animal cards that come with the book for the last two pages; the rest of the book is typical LeapPad with games and music. The cards are small and could be easily lost, but I found that if you just store them in a small ziploc bag, it's not a problem. Also, the set comes with one WILD card that can replace any of the other cards, so if you lose an animal, just replace it with the WILD card when you need to. Kids who love the show "Stanley" or who just like to learn about animals will love this LeapPad book
