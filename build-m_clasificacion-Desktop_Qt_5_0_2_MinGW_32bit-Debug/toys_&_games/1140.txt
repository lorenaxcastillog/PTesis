 I just finished this painting. This is not appropriate for someone under the age of 15. The spaces are small, and for a child it would be difficult. This is not the first painting that I have purchased. I have purchased paintings from both Deminsions and CraftHouse. The only complaint that I have about Demensions is that they only provide one brush and most of the time the bristles splinter and it makes it difficult to paint the small areas. CraftHouse always provides 2 which is what I use on all of the paintings. I enjoy all of the paintings that I have purchased. I lean more to the scenery especially the sea scapes
