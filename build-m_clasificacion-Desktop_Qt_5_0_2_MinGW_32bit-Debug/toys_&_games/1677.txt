 I want to buy the Bratz dolls. But everytime I look at reviews for them, all I see is people fighting over which doll is better and if the Midnight Dance dolls are goth. Who cares? This isn't a message board and this isn't a place to fight! You people are suppose to review these items so people like me can see if we want them or not! So please stop all this madness! Thank you! Oh and if you say that you don't like Bratz and that they are "sluts" as you call them, no one is telling you to buy them. If you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. You need to come back to reality and realize that Bratz are being sold all around the world and you can't stop that! So if you don't like Bratz, then keep it to yourself. There are people that like them! Thank you
