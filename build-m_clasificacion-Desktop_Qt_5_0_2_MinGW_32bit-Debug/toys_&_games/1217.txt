 I just don't understand why other kids aren't able to figure these shoes out. My daughter just barely turned five and picked out the purple moon shoes for her birthday. I'm a 26 year old woman, and I didn't have a single problem putting them together, it wasn't near as hard as other people have made it out to be. Now, I know that these shoes are for ages 7 and up, but I figured my energetic, boisterous wild child wouldn't have a problem. She LOVES them. I spent the first five minutes holding her hand and helping her balance, and she took off on her own after that. I will not let her wear them without supervision, as I'm a very responsible parent. She fell over a couple of times, but she's a kid, so she handles falls well. I don't see these shoes being any more dangerous than a trampoline. If my five year old daughter can handle these shoes, I don't see why anybody else can't. Just be a responsible parent and watch your kids closely, just as you would if they were on a trampoline
