 Speaking the truth , these cars are not so hard find,i happened to find sarge, matter, fillmore and lighting mcqueen at target...the demand is high but not over the edge...its online sellers that make you believe these are hard to get, so you can fall for the bait and purchase from them at 20.00 bucks a piece..dont get ripped off!!!! just go around your local toystores, walgreens, cvs, go to your local rinky-dinky pharmacy and youll find them.....sometimes in autoparts like pep-boys youll find them....and by the way theyre not so overpriced in ebay....they range from 7 to 10 bucks with shipping and everything...by the way i dont have lizzie, but i wont give my hopes up.....lizzie by all means looks and IS the hardest car to get..i mean just look at her!!!!! come on!!!!!!!
