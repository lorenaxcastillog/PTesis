 Radio Flyer seriously messed up when they designed this trike. Part of the concept is great... it folds up! The second part of the concept is the telescoping handle that does not steer, is kinda jiggly to start with, and isn't wide enough for you to really steer your kid with. The problem lies in the design. You can't have the ability to co-pilot like the other radio flyer trikes because it folds up. That disconnects the handle in rear from the front wheel, which is what steers. It jiggles around because it telescopes out, meaning all those little spaces in between where one segment fits into the next equals a lot of room by the time you pull it out all the way. Being that you can't easily steer (you have to pick up the back or lift the front to turn if you have the steering locked), you have to push to back and forth to keep it going straight. THis is hard to do with the small handle they put on this thing. Save your money and get one of their other ones, which all have great reviews
