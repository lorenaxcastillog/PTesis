 I purchased this item with reasonable expectations. I wanted it to move forward and backward and be able to drive along my blacktop driveway and maybe even my grass a little. It barely moves. My daughter is an average size 3 year old so she is not weighting it down. Its main issue is the battery. It takes 18-30 hours to charge - that's a minimum of a day and a half, yet if you get 30 minutes of drive time you are lucky. and even then, it moves so slowly its a crawl - hardly the 2.5 MPH promised, forget 5MPH. Also, the plastic is rather thin so I doubt it will hold up to any inadvertant taps. Think twice about this - it might be cute but it doesn't move worth a shoot
