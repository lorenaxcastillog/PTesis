 I got 5 different ones plus the tv thing for our kids. (Yes, I have six kids.) It's not even a week after xmas and none of them will play with it. To much work. You spent the better part of an hour digging for various items, money being the most important and then have to take your money to the store to buy things,like FOOD, feed the pet just to have the pet still be hungry. What a pain the the behind!! Even the oldest won't do it!! And I'm an adult! We are taking ours back for a full refund
