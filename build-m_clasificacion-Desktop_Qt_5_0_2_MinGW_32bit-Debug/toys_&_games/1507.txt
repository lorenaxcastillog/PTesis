 Bought these for my son before he was even born and glad I did. My son loved these since shortly after he came home from the hospital and they weren't the kind of toys that he was over in a month (which I love). First I would just show them to him and as he grew I would also attach them to his play gym, his crib, his stroller, his swing, then when he started teething he would chew on the flower and as he grew he just loved shaking them and making all the crinkling sounds and feeling the different textures. At about 18 months we finally gave these to my son's cousin (my neice who is 4 months) who also just loves them - it was more me that didn't want to part with them (all his little things I find hard to part with:) These are a great buy, very well made and last a long time, they are STILL in perfect condition and it's almost 2 years since I bought them
