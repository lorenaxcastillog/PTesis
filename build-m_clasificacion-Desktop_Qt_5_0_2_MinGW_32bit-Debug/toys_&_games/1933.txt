 Our kids love this wagon! They can pull each other around the yard and it's next to impossible to tip over, the dog can even pull it in her harness and not tip it over! It's held up very well, we've had it for about 5 years and it's still holding strong! The only sign of wear is it got a scratch in the paint (my husband's fault) and it has rusted just a touch there, we are planning on fixing that in a few weeks to make it look new! It also works great for yard work! My son loves using it to help him with his job of picking up sticks in the yard, he piles them high and finishes his job in half the time
