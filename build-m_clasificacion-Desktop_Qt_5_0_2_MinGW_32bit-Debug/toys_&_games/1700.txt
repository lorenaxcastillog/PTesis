 I researched all the marble toys, and while it was down to this or Haba, my 6 yo son chose this because of the colors and the spirals (which he said were "super cool". Even though it is more expensive than the plastic marble runs, it is well worth it. While I think haba might work better for 4&5 yo's because of the easier set up, I think this toy is better for 6 and up, and more likely to be used as they get older. Great for problem solving, spatial relations , and for putting a real lot of marbles through so they go down super fast! The day we got it we set it up on the living room table, and it has not been put away yet!
