 I got the Hovercraft for my son's 5th birthday, even though it is recommended for 8 and over. It has some limitations but all those are described on the box, except for the battery life which really doesn't last that long (20 minutes). He hasn't been disappointed with it when it runs out of power. The instructions and the outside of the box clearly say that it should be used on 'smooth' pavement and 'calm' water and that the skirt should be periodically checked (it does slip in places at times but it's easy to put back on). If you don't have the proper conditions, I would avoid the urge to buy it because it will just frustrate you. It's a little hard to steer because you have to anticipate and turn early since the air 'hover' keeps it going longer in the direction it's already headed in (that may be where the 8+ age group can figure that out). We have had many remote control toys and lots have disappointed us, but this one is pretty good as long as you use it as instructed and don't expect to do things it is not meant to do
