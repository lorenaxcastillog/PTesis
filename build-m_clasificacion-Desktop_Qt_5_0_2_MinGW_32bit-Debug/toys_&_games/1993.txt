 My mother (she's a great grandmother) bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Unfortunately, at her age, she forgets to keep receipts. This item did not even work for two days. When I returned after Christmas, I tried to return it but could only exchange because the packaging had been thrown away. The second Video Jr. Now continually skips if you just bump it. I can never find any new discs at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, or anywhere else. I put in a complaint to Hasbro/Playskool but I have never received any response back as to how to return it. I mean, it cost $40.00 and it's not worth it. I would not recommend anyone paying for something that doesn't last long.
