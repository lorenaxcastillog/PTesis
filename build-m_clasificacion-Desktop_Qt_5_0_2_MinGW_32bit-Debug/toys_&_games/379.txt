 If you love the unpredictable, then Catch 22 is for you. This game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens. Just when I thought I was about to win the game, my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens. Boy, that did not make me happy at all. The key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely. The cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money. Once you use the cubes, you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker' square. You can collect any blocker cube placed on the board, including your opponent's cubes. I made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents. We were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long. I highly recommend it, but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt!
