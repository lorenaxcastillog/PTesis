 I bought this cartridge for my 4YO son. He loves it. The games are fun and very educational. His favorite is the "LetterPiller" game, where the child guides a little caterpillar to letters in order to form words. There is a cute show when the word is complete and the game is very forgiving of mistakes. This has really helped my son learn to keep trying. Before he got his leapster, he would get upset after making a mistake, now he doesn't care at all. There is also a bumper car math game which is a little advanced for him, but would probably be good for a 5YO. There is a "log ride" game which teaches grammer. My son really likes that one too. While I think this is way to easy for a real first grader, it is perfect for a 4-6YO child. My 4YO absolutely adores it. So I think the game deserves 5 stars even though they got the ages wrong
