 We bought this for our 7 months old and she did not like it at all. There was really nothing to amuse her. We had placed some toy's in it, but that still did nothing for her.If you are looking for somewhere to place your child and listen to them scream of boredom ... then here are your two stars. As far as bouncing, this was not a good idea. There was really no support to the walls of this item. Bouncing for a 18-20 pounder was not a good idea. The bouncer never sat straight, it always had a tilt to it. Maybe from the packaging. Also,the toy's hung wrong overhead as well. We are now 4 months later (of not that much use) throwing it out!!! Somewhere, it has sprung a leak and we cannot seem to find it either. So, overall ... this was not one of our better choices
