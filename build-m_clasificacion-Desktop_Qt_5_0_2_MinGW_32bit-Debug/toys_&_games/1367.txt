 This story is about a fish who had glittery scales. All the other fish wanted to be like Rainbow Fish, so they would invite him to play with them. Rainbow Fish was self-centered and always said no. Once a little blue fish asked if he could have a glittery scale, but Rainbow Fish said no. All the other fish grew angry at him and did not speak to him. Rainbow Fish was worried and went for advice from the Wise Octopus. The octopus told Rainbow Fish to be kind to others and not to be selfish. So Rainbow Fish went back home and gave the little blue fish a scale. The blue fish was so happy he couldn't wait to show off his glittery scale. Soon after, all the fish wanted to have glittery scales. Rainbow Fish gave everyone a scale and became friends again. I think this a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson learned is to always share and you'll have many friends.
