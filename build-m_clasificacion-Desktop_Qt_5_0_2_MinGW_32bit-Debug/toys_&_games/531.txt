 Let me just say this: my 4 year old is a certifiable Dora nut. She loves her. You could give her a bag with Dora on it and she'd think it was the cat's meow. But, I must say, Mom-Mom came through big with this toy for her 4th birthday. She loves that Dora feeds the twin babies from the bottle attached to her hand. She loves the little song that Dora sings about being a Big Sister when she presses Dora's hand. She's already singing it around the house. The feeding accesories are cute and durable as well and the twin babies themselves are all too cute in and of themselves. Also, Since my four-year old daughter is a twin as well - she has a twin brother - I think she can really relate to this toy on that level as well. Great toy
