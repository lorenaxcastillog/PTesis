 Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME
