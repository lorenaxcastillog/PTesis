 When my son received this for a Christmas gift we actually did not open it right away. We though he (16 mo at the time) would grow out of it too soon and thought we would return it for something that would last longer. After he was always going to the box we gave in. This has been one of the most popular toys in our house - especially when friends and my nephew (5!!) come over! It's taken several dives off the coffee table and shows no damage. It is a very entertaining toy for my son. My only issue is that I don't like the voice for some of the rhymes - but obviously that's personal! I definitely recommend this toy for 12 mo and up
