 just my opinion; but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter's first leap pad. she loves maurice sendak's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo-24mo age range. i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system. as for the pooh bear game; i agree; way too easy here; this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children, and made a more challenging one for this level. great idea; just not well put together
