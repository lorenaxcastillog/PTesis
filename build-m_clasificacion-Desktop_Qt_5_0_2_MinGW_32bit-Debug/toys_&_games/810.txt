 I had trouble getting this product to work, but that was only because I was too eager to play and hadn't read the enclosed instructions. Initially, I set the sensitivity all the way to 10 and was frustrated when it didn't work at all. The instructions say to turn down the sensitivity until the lights turn off. Once I did that, it worked great. With the sensitivity too high, it was interpreting everything as one constant movement and not picking up on the changes, so it wasn't identifying my movements. Now that I understand the instructions, I can get it to work anywhere. It is such an great toy, you can't not buy this one
