 This was the hit of Xmas for our 23-month old. The remote worked very well and was more advanced than some of the other "beginner" RC cars. He couldn't care less about the animals--dumped them out and never touched them again--but was entranced by his ability to control the car. However. He was carrying it about a 6 inches above a tile floor and dropped the car. That was that. It stopped responding to the remote and he was very unhappy.
