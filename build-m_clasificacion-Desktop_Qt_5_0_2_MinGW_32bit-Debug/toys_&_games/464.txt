 My 5-year-old adores this addition to his moonsand play set. The kit includes enough sand to make cars and other items to "run over" with the included Monster Truck. He had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week after a month of me purchasing it. The new inserted play mat for the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him to play like he's at the Monster Trucks show! Great Idea! for a new and fun way to make and keep moonsand play sets interesting. Yes, moonsand can get messy, but didn't we all learn creatively through making messes when we were younger? I'll gladly sweep this up when he's done
