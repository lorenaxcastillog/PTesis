 We had a hard time folding it back up. The main problem was getting it to deflate. I am sure we just didn't do it right, so it wouldn't fold back up with air still in it. My 1 year old daughter preferred a baby boat with an attached toy bar she could chew on and play with, but her 1 yr old cousin tried this float and enjoyed it. The child sits down in the water pretty good- which is nice for keeping cool. It seems to be quite stable, as a result. I will continue to use this float with my baby girl and see how she likes it as she gets a little bigger
