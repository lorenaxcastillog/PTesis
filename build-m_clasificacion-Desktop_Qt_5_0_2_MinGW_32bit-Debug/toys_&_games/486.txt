 My oldest daughter got the older version of this product for her 5th birthday. She could only play a couple of the games at the time, but she loved it. For three years now it has been her all-time favorite car toy. It has been dropped, banged, kicked, stepped on, fought over, and everything else two kids could do to it in 3 years, and still works great! Drawbacks: Pixter & Leapster caught on that kids might actually want to play their toys past 5pm in the car & put LCD lighting in, but this company hasn't caught on yet. Also, no headphones jack--some of the games make incredibly annoying noises! One more thing--the ages are not appropriately labeled. Closer to first grade and up
