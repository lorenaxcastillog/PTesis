 Don't waste your money on this Pooh. My son got him for Christmas and didn't really care anything about him. I know that you can change the songs but our Pooh says Happy Birthday to my son every day. I probably can change that, though. He doesn't keep the time. Every day he got more and more off until he was singing and talking in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT and AT NAP TIME! Well, needless to say, he he is no longer with us! He lives in the garage. My husband put him out there after he woke my son up, AGAIN! I will be storing him in the attic soon. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to purchase him. He says my son's name really funny too. I was extremely disappointed with this
