 It was fun while it lasted, but I hate how poorly toys are put together these days. What happened to well-constructed American toys? For one thing, it eats up WAY too many batteries. They should make it run on a 9V one instead. All those AAs cost money! And then after a couple months it just stopped working altogether. My husband tried to open it up and fix it and could only get it running again by wrapping the whole thing up in black electrical tape. Everytime it stopped working my toddler son and I had to jiggle it just right for something to connect right again. Frustration, frustration. We give up on ever getting one of these again
