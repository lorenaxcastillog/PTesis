 I purchased the wooden version of this toy over the plastic version because I thought the wooden would be more durable. I cannot speak for the plastic set, but the wooden set is certainly not made the way it was when I was a child. I bought this for a Christmas present, and a month later many of the parts are damaged. Many of the ends of the rods have cracked off. A few rods broke when I was playing with my two daughters, so I know the breakage occured during average and gentle play. I was very disapointed in the overall quality. This is another classic toy that is now being produced overseas, and is not the toy it once was.
