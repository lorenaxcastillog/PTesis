 We bought this for our son's birthday and it was his big present. He's a superhero nut and had been begging for this since he first saw it. After we had it put together and charged it up we went to walk outside. He dropped it a distance of about 2 and 1/2 feet and the it broke OFF at the knees!!! Much crying insued. After a quick trip to get glue we tried to fly the darn thing. It never flew. This should be more correctly termed a glider at best and definately not for children under say 14 or so. We were able to return it thank goodness. I must say this is just another in the long line of large Mattel products we have bought that are not put together well and do NOT stand the test of play. Such as the The Batman Batcave (falls apart), The JLA watchtower(won't stand up), the mini Batcave (falls apart) etc. etc. I think we have learned our lesson
