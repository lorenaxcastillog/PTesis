 The best toys are open-ended, to let kids use their imaginations when they play with them, and these blocks are just the ticket. I had these blocks as a child, my daughter had a set when she was little, I use them in the classrooms at my child development center, and now my nephew is enjoying his set. There are enough in the set to let kids build really big structures - a fort large enough to hide in, a very tall wall, etc. If you can only get a kid one gift, this is a great one to choose
