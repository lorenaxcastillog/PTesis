 We got this for our pirate-obsessed 4 year old for Christmas - it's now August, and I'd guess that he has played with it almost every day since then. I know some people complain about its fragility and the &quot;tiny-ness&quot; of some of the pieces, but I think this is a great way to teach a child to care for his belongings - we've still got just about every piece, included those four tiny wine goblets. It's also great for developing small muscle control - our son has gotten very adept at putting tiny swords in tiny hands, and loves mixing and matching hair, beards, etc. It's probably not for every child - but I pretty much worship Playmobil!! No other toys come close to capturing pur son's imagination and attention
