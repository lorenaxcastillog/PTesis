 My son's 4th birthday is tomorrow, Sept. 17, and he said he really wanted a kitchen. I wanted to get him a more expensive Step 2 one but he insisted he liked this one the best. (I think he loved the idea of the real towel) I just finished putting it together which was very easy but getting the oven and fridge doors on was a little annoying and they don't close completely u have to push a little to get them closed so I don't know if that will frustrate my son.....we'll see. In the directions it tells u to dab a little dish detergent on the the oven knob to make pushing it in easier, well I saved this part for last and had to use all my might to get the knob on! I don't understand why they can't just attatch the little knob when they making these but oh well. My son will be using this tomorrow and I'll get back with an update! I would also recommend u putting it together before your child knows u got it for them
