 Repetition, repetition, repetition. Excellent! My daughter has learning challenges and LOVES this &quot;toy.&quot; Although she has the addition facts down, she was having difficulty recalling them quickly. With this game she can play when she wants, miss some answers and still protect her &quot;ego&quot;, jazz around the room &quot;showing off&quot; her skills, and have a great time. A bit of rythm, a little skippy tune, a friend to challenge and correct. Great idea! I haven't tried the add-on, but am considering purchasing it. Without the add-on it is self contained learning fun that helps improve skills and encourage additional learning
