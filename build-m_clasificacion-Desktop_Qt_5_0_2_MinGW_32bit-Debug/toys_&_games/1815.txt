 I had looked everywhere for this little doll! Ariel is a great first doll for our little one and the only doll we could find that matched our own little red head with blue eyes. Ariel is all soft except for her head and there are no items(i.e. buttons, beads,etc.) that can pull off from her outfit. The only thing that needs to be watched for is her hair, she has a tiny clear hairband that holds her hair back which I just removed due to having a little one who still puts everything in her mouth and that was the first thing that she tried to get at!!!! Now I want to get the other Little Princess' in the collection!
