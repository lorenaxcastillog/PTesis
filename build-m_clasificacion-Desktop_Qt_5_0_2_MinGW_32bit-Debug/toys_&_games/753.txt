 This set can certainly be used as a toy for kids. However, its real purpose is more decorative than functional. It is designed for display by hardcore Halloween and horror fans. In that regard, it is outstanding. Michael Myers looks just about as I'd picture him from the first two movies. However, I am really impressed with what they did with Dr. Loomis. Loomis is the sort of guy who, if you don't get the likeness right, can easily come out looking like Lenin. The figure looks about as good as something in this size range can look. The other features are quite good, as well. The steps and the surroundings are attractive. (They do screw you out of the shrubs that are pictured on the box, however.) Overall, I thought this was beautifully done. The effect is quite authentic. Everything looks just as one would hope. I hope they eventually create more of these, to commemorate the later films, as well. (I personally would pay heavily to see Loomis released featuring his 2by4 from part 5.) If they do make another one, they'll have a hard time topping this one
