 Although it's supposed to be for three years and up, I bought it for my daughter's first birthday. I figured that we could have fun with it anyway. I couldn't have been more right. From the moment she saw it, she only wanted to play on the horse. Initially it started with me putting her on the horse and helping her rock, however within a few months she was climbing up and down and rocking on her own. I am not sure if her climbing skills were accelerated due to the horse, but she sure is more daring than many of her similarly aged friends
