 My [...] son is a Dora/Diego freak and he got this for Christmas. He loves it! We also got the little expansion set that has Dora and Boots in bathing suits and a couple other beach things (a crab, sandcastle, sand slide). I just wish they made more parts that can go with this. They make a lot of pieces for the Dora's talking house and stuff but those figurines are bigger than these. And there are a couple little sets that will go with this (like the beach one I got) but they all have Dora and Boots again... I want other characters like Diego, Tico, Benny, etc. Although, I did see the schoolhouse which I will probably order now. But they still need more compatible pieces
