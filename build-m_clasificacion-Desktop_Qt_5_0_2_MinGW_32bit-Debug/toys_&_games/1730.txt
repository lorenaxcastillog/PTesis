 This has been one of my son's favorite toys if not his favorite for about 5 mos now. When I bought this for him he didnt know how to pop up the bobble heads but that didnt matter to him because once I showed him how to open it he was fascinated with those little heads. He quickly mastered closing each one.The music suprisingly is also activated when you hit the bobble head as well as hitting the knobs/buttons so he could still enjoy it even if he was still learning to open it. Out of all the money spent on toys this 14.99 toy has surpassed my expectations and is still being played with every day, several times a day
