 My daughter LOVED this kitchen from about 9 mos. till about 13 mos., then she lost interest. She used to dance to the sounds that it makes (which to me are fun and not irritating, like other toys). It did sometimes go off on its own...usually if a door slammed or even thunder. We would just turn it off at night. This toy was by far my baby's favorite and it held her interest much longer than any other toy. Its a great size for a busy crawler/new walker and it has enough things to open/press/drop for the 7-12 mos. set. Though the 2 and 3 year-olds who come over have fun with it too! I recommend this for babies younger than one year, though he/she may have fun with it longer than that
