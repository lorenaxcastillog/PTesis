 After looking in stores, catalogs and online we decided to order this table for our two year old son. Even though the price was a bit more than I felt we needed to spend it was worth it. The quality is great the legs are thick and sturdy Our son loves it! Of course he loved helping me attach the legs which was simple and after we comvinced him to turn it over he was delighted to belly up with his colors and books. We feel this is a great quality piece that will be easily incoporated into his room as an bedside table or end table after he out grows its current purpose
