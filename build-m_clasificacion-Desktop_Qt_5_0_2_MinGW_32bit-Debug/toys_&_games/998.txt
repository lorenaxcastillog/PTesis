 I bought the original when my kids were 5 and 3, and it was a good game for them to play together for a change. The DVD game has the same concept, but is more visual; when the announcer announces the pad, the possibilities show up on the screen. All the pads are animals (no food, musical instruments, as in the original), but there is minimal animal education. Kids might learn which animals are farm animals, which are ocean animals, etc. I think there is less variation in this game than the original; after a few days play and repeat games, I can figure out (but not my kids)which pad will be the winning one. One of the best features of the original, is that it made my kids listen to the instructions. Listening skills can be replaced by visual cues in the DVD version.
