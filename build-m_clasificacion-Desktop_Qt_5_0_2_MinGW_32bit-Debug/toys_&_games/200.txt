 I'm not going to go into my childhood, or how I love the Transformers or any of that stuff, I just wanted to give a quick review. As always, you get what you pay for. I bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and I can't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket. Bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a G1 inspired Astrorain or Starscream, but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching TV. Very cool, very flimsy, very inexpensive
