 My 7 year old received this as a Christmas present. She was so excited to write her own book, we added the about the Author page and she wrote and illustrated the story. We bought one book for our family and the second book we dedicated to her school teachers and gave it to the school on Teacher Appreciation Day with a note that we wanted the book to be placed in the library. Now all of my daughters friends and others can check the book out of the library and they love it! I highly recommend this as a gift to anyone
