 Loud annoying and entertaining for only a day. I got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds, both "had to have it". They watched it dance for about 30 minutes and that was the extent of the play with this doll. It isn't a doll that they can use imagination with, snuggle with, or any other type of constructive play. A Dora video would have been a better choice. At least their attention would have been captured for the 30 minutes and then they would have watched it again later. In order to get the skirt to stay on (to change the song she danced to) I had to push VERY hard. My kids couldn't do it on their own
