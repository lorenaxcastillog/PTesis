 I bought this toy as a Christmas gift for my 18 months old boy based on the reviews posted by other parents. What a great toy this is! I had the Pound A Ball delivered to my work and immediately opened it. It was a lot of fun to play with (even my co-workers played). The balls are a little hard to pound through at first, but after trying a couple of times, the balls went through fine. Even my son was able to pound them with no problem. I only wish there were extra balls available to purchase (my son already lost two). Overall, this toy can sustain a lot of abuse, it's easy to clean and keeps kids entertained for hours
