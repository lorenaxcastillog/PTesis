 My daughter loves this game. It is not educational, but is usually better than watching TV. Advantages - The box takes up little space. I actually like how the board is 4 puzzle pieces for this reason, and do not find it flimsy. - The jewelry seems as durable as other play jewelry to me, but I have not bought Disney jewelry before. - The spinner/ jewelry box does seem very durable, and is such a great idea. - My daughter loves just playing with the jewelry for dressup. Disadvantages - Not very educational (little strategy is involved). - Many fathers would not be willing to play this game. - The game pieces are so much fun apart from the game, that they may become los
