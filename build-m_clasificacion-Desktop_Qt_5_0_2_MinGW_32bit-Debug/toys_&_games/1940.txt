 Rodimus is an homage to the Generation 1 Autobot Hot Rod, who later became Rodimus Prime in the Transformers animated movie from 1986. The transformation can be a bit tricky, as a few of the connections have to be finagled back and forth before they become lose. One has to be careful when putting the feet in position, as it is not readily obvious it has stabilizers within the main part of the feet to flip out behind the robot. Once done correctly, Rodimus stands quite nicely and stablely. The gun does shoot it's missle, but does not have more than an 18 inch range. All in all, a nice solid toy.
