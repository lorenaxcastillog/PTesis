 My son got this for Christmas, even though he wasn't quite 9 months old. He liked it in the beginning and played with it, but now (at 12 months) all I do is listen to the crowd cheer. If he can't find a basketball, he'll put anything that will fit into the basket. The football used to be our favorite, but now it's less so. My son is trying to hit the baseball with the bat and lights up every time, though only once has he been able to make the ball move. I have had no problems with this and I thought it was fairly easy to assemble by myself. I've even given this as a gift to others because my son loves it so much. I especially love that it has 2 sound levels, so outside it can be louder and in return, it can be slightly quiter inside
