 My 2 girls ages 7 & 6 played with this all day on Christmas. I was pretty impressed with the graphics from a system at this price. I also really appreciate the discs being in a protective plastic case so they cannot be damaged by little hands. I also love that the controller can be switched for right or left handed players, or however you prefer. I even loved playing along with the kids. The girls are already asking for another game. It comes with a game called "Jumping Beans" that helped them with spelling and math. There is also some games that deal with geography and creating a dancing cartoon character and a 3D vehicle...all enjoyed by my kids. Of course the graphics are nothing compared to a Sony Playstation or X Box, but for younger kids its just the right.
