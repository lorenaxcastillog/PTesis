 My 2 1/2 yo received this puzzle for Christmas. He is a big Thomas fan, so the subject matter was perfect. The pieces are quite large - I'd estimate 4 inches by 4 inches, and are well-made. The graphics are colorful and accurate - the puzzle depicts Thomas, Percy, James, Cranky & Harold. My son asks to put the puzzle together over and over. He can now do most of it by himself just by putting together one engine at a time. The fact that the pieces fit together easily and are large make it less frutrating for him. I'd highly recommend this puzzle for any Thomas fan
