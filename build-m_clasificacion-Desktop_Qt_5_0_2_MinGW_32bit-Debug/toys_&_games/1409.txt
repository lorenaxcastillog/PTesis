 There is a small white bead in the bottom of the SNAKE NUT CAN; it is a choking hazard for young children. (I think the bead is included in the bottom of the "can" so that it sounds like there is something inside the can when you shake it.) When I opened the box of 25 SNAKE NUT CANS, many of the white beads and bottom lids were all over the box. The SNAKE NUT CANS have too many pieces: plastic can, screw top, yellow spring(which represents the snake), bottom lid that pushes and comes out easily (it is supposed to conceal the hits bead), and white bead. I expected it to have 3 parts: can, screw top, and spring (which represents the snake). The bottom lid is cumbersome (and comes out easily)and the white bead is a choking hazard. Vendor did not allow me to return this item because I ordered more than 24. Amazon helped me resolve this issue
