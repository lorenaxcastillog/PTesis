 I bought this for my 6 year old even though it's recommended for ages 8 and up. She has had it for almost a year and it's still working! However, I have emphasized that she keep it in her room, so she hasn't carried it around much. The sound quality is fine for a youngster and she learned quickly how to change the CDs, which is front-loading. She has used it a lot and I feel that it has helped her learn how to relax in her room sometimes instead of follow me around asking what she can do! (Probably sounds familiar to lots of moms.) I would recommend this as a first real CD player
