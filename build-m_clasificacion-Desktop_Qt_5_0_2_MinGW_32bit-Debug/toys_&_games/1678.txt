 Our son got this for his 1st birthday. He was immediately interested in playing with these and chewing on them. He loves to take them out of the bag they came in and put them back in again. They stack well as the foam sticks together a little bit so they don't slide. Our son chews on them all the time and he has left a lot of tooth-marks, but that doesn't detract from the fun. The bag they come in has holes to reduce suffocation risk. I will buy a new set for our next child. This is a great first set of blocks for a toddler
