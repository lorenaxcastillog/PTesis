 This toy has been great so far. I purchased it for my 7 year old who just had to have it for Christmas. I found the battery pack right on a rack at Best Buy for $20. The 2 boys have laughed and played for hours with it. My 7 year old took his Christmas money and purchased an NSECT also by TYCO (all battereies included) and he loves that too. Only problem now is that the radio frequencies conflict so they cant play with them at the same time. I should have checked that. I would recommend either of these toys for boys their age. I love to watch them light up
