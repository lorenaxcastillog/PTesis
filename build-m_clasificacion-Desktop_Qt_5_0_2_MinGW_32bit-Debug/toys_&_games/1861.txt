 I played this with my 9 year old daughter, 7 year old son (who was reluctant because it was a "girly" game, he LOVED it though and wanted to play more, but I did have to help him because it requires reading cards to play), and 16 year old son (who was also reluctant--he won't admit it, but he DID have fun, and I'm sure I can "force" him to play again!) It is a great way to get your kids to talk to each other, laugh and joke around, very family oriented. I would highly recommend this as a family game or a game for a slumber party with preteen girls
