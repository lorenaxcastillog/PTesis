 With 4 kids, ages 2-8, we have at least 3 or 4 bins of these blocks. This size is really nice because they are easy to handle and build with. The finished product does not come out tiny. This size is nice also because it's not small enough to really be a choke hazard for my 2 year old and not so large that my 8 year old feels like she's playing with a baby toy. As I said in a previous review, the Duplos are absolutely the most played-with toy in this house. Everyone enjoys them. The possibilities are endless when you have a million blocks! When in doubt, BUY DUPLOS! No kid doesn't like them and there is no such thing as too many. P.S.**The description says something about gold blocks in this set. I have no idea what they're talking about. We bought 2 of our sets from this listing here on Amazon and I can assure you we have absolutely NO gold blocks.
