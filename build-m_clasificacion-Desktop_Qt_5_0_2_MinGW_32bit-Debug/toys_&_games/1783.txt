 I'm a nanny so i've played with alot of toys...This one is one of my least favorites. The little guy who owned this to was totally freaked out. Every time pooh crawled nearby he would swat it aside. Once he was strong enough he would chuck it across the room...I was freaked out by the toy as well, it would turn on at odd hours of the day and night. As for educational value...Zilch!! Do you really need a toy to teach your child how to crawl? The only thing this toy ever did for my my little guy was to strengthen his pitching arm.
