 Go figure. I picked this head because it seemed to be a significant size, and have a lot of silky-looking hair, real lashes, and fun (rather than tacky) features and make-up being a fairy rather than a teen. However, her hair is very fine and is actually glued together in parts to retain her curls. It is painful to watch my three year old twins struggle to get the included brush through her hair. Impossible. I tried to give it a once-over to help them out, but it tears and ends up looking frizzy and uneven -- I had to re-trim the bottom. The head also tips over easily when you try working with her hair. A ridiculous waste of money
