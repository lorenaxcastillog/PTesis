 It is fun! And most importantly educational. It has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot. My kids like that part. They are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game, we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges. Next year my youngest will want one too, I am sure, as she wants to play theirs,but she is just too little yet, another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..
