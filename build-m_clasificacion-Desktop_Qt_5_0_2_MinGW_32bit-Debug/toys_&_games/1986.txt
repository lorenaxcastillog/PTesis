 This sandbox is terrible. We have had it for one year now and it doesn't keep the water out even with the lid on. In fact, there are such large gaps between the lid and the box that it becomes an insect haven (spiders, earwigs etc). The wind has blown the lid off several times. And so much moisture got into it over the winter because the lid didn't fit properly that when we opened it up this spring all the sand was moldy on top. Talk about disgusting. Unfortunately, my hubby is really frugal so he won't let me buy a new box for our girls but for those of you still shopping, my advice is to save yourselves the hassle and spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better box.
