 This van is so cool,I fitted my mikey figure with the cowabunga carl head topper.The pizza firing action is cool too.When you install all 8 pizzas inside the van,pull the cowabunga carl head topper and it fires the pizza.I like the detail on the van,it is really nice.Mikey fits on the driver seat and this is a fun vehicle to play with,especially when I put mikey inside.I had fun with the cowabunga carl head topper and I started trying my other figures and I was laughing at them with the cowabunga carl head topper on them.This is based on the movie and I love TMNT because they're cool and awesome and have a lot of action!This TMNT van/vehicle is highly recommended to any TMNT fan
