 For those of you complaining that this game is too simplistic for adults, try playing the adult version! This is the true game and not at all like the simple kids version. The game is described on the Sorry! rules sheet. Instead of the cards being drawn one at a time as in the kid's version, each player is dealt a five card hand. This opens a whole new level of strategy as the game then becomes dependent not so much on the luck of the draw, but how the cards are played! With these rules the game can be played for a lifetime and never grow stale
