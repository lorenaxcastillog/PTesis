 I bought this DVD with gear from Walmart at $13, steeply reduced from the original price. I am watching it while writing this review. The lead plummish oldest presenter/"ballerina", probably a teenager, is the worst dancer. Her ungraceful dancing style has little to do with ballet. Other little girls are just so much better. Unfortunately the camera was not focused on them. The smelly plastic mat made with cheap PVC is slippery. The bar is unsteady. It has turned into a towel rack in our household. The whole thing seems awfully and amateurly put together. The best thing is clips from various actual ballet performances. You don't want to introduce ballet to your little ones from this DVD. It has nothing to do with ballet, let alone Swan Lake.
