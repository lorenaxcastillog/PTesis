 One of our 5 year olds just recently received this game for Christmas. This is one of the best gifts any of my kids have ever gotten. He just loves it. This game is a great way to challenge a child's thinking skills. My son loves it. At age 5, it's just right. He is very bright, so he is able to do all of the cards, some quicker than others. He likes to start with the hardest card first, so that it gets easier as he works through the pile. :) As a parent, I also like that it has its own little drawstring bag that can hold everything. This is so much better than a flimsy box that you have to keep on taping. A great game to take along when you are going somewhere that waiting is involved. I would definitely recommend this game. I will be buying a couple to keep on hands for last minute gift ideas for ages 4-8.
