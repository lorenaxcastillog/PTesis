 My two year olds dont even like this toy. They love the wiggles, they do point to the characters and say their names - but to PLAY on it. Not possible. The songs mumble jumble all over each other as the kids move on the matt. Its a very loud speaker and even I cannot take it (Im very liberal w/ loud toys and banging, etc) There is not an ounce of fun in this toy, im very disappointed as most of the other wiggles toys have been great. Dont spend your money on this one. OR keep your receipt handy.
