 I bought my son James as a reward because James is one of his favorites (it might have to do with James being my son's middle name, but who knows). As with James, and the other big engines with coal cars, they are my son's favorites. In fact, he will take all the coal cars, put them together and have one train pull them. He has figured out that only one train pulls cargo, not pulls other trains. anyone who complains about the price isn't a thomas fan. thomas is pricey, plain and simple, but you are also getting a LIFETIME guarentee. If anything breaks, they send you a new one
