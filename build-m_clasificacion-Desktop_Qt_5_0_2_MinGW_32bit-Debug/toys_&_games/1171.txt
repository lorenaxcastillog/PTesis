 I love this yasmin doll so much. She was the 4th rock angelz i got (cloe 1st jade 2nd roxxi 3rd yasmin 4th n sasha 5th) When i bought her i couldnt wait to take her out the box. When i got home and took yasmin out she was more beautiful than she was in the box. Her hair was a bit frizzy but i ran my straigtners over it (lol) and her hair was fine. Yasmin came in flairy jeans a rock angels T and a rockish leather jacket She came with a collectible guitar, stand, microphone and stand, rock angel concert t, belly button piercing and tatto and a CD. Yasmin is a greta doll and i would reccomend any one to buy her Peace Emma xxxxxx
