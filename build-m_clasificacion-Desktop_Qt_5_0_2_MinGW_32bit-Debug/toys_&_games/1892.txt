 My children, ages 3, 4, and 10, loved playing with these puzzles at our pediatrician's office so much, it was difficult to get them to leave. When we found this set on Amazon.com, we purchased them immediately. Each puzzle comes with a plastic tray, a full-size black and white photo with the outlines of each shape, and a one-piece foam frame for the outside edges. Smaller children can put the puzzle together right over top of the black and white photo, making the puzzles simple enough for toddlers to assemble on their own. Older children can put the puzzles together without using the photo as a backdrop, making the puzzles a little more challenging as they grow.
