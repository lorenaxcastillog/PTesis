 Here in America, Lindsay Lohan is what many call a conspiracy. Lindsay Lohan is NOT a "beloved collector's item". She's a bulimic spoiled brat. She's also, weird. MyScene has made the biggest marketing mistake of their life. Lindsay Lohan went from cute child star to bulimic brat in a milisecond. She thinks she can sing, and she can't. She thinks she can do a romantic comedy, and she can't. (Just My Luck, was not "lucky") I bet not even a million bought this doll from a cheap knock-off of the Barbie line. You'd only buy your child this doll if you want them to idolize a young woman who has thrown her life away
