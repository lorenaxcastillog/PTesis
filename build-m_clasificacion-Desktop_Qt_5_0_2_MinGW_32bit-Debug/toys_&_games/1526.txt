 We purchased this for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas. This is a great art cart! I looked at many different kinds of art easels and decided on this one because of the storage. Although there is no magnetic dry erase board, it makes up for it in all other areas. The chalkboard is an actual chalkboard (not the kind that is tough to draw/erase on). The colors are great to go in a playroom and the cart is very sturdy...We don't have to worry about it folding in on itself. Very easy to move around too with the sturdy wheels. Couldn't be happier with our purchase!
