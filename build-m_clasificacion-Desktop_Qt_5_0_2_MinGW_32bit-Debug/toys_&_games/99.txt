 I saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv. I was SHOCKED that they were still selling it! Years ago, my young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls come out. We had called Playskool and they had us return it to the store and they sent us a free 'I'm sorry' gift. The one pictured on Amazon is the DANGEROUS one that many kids have gotten their arms stuck in. If you look on the Playskool website, they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole where kids like to stick their little paws. Be sure you get the newer version! It is a super cute toy, and I am glad they have fixed the problem so many have had
