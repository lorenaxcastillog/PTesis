 First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos. Thus this ship was something of a disappointment. As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it. The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it. Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it. So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details
