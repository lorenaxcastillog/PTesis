 What a great idea. This game is a lot of fun. My 6 year old got it for his birthday. It takes a bit of coordination to accomplish the goal of getting the ball in the hole. With a little practice he has become quite good at it. The way it works is you swing the golf club over top of the ball sensor. On the TV your swing is captured in the game and directs your ball. You can control how hard you swing and where you aim. It seems that this game is more frustrating for some kids. When my son's friends came over to play some of them picked it up quickly and others got frustrated with it. Overall, with some practice this has become a fun game in our family
