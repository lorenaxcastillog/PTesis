 We got this at the incredibly discounted price of $4.99 and at that price, it was a GREAT deal! My six-year-old daughter loves it and plays with it almost every day. She has a couple of the full-size mermaid Barbie dolls, and thinks this playset is a perfect "home" for them. Much to my surprise, my four-year-old son likes it, too! He can't get enough of sliding "Bibble" down the slide in the "bubble" - an added bonus for us! We are very pleased with this toy and were thrilled to get it at the discounted price because I probably would not have paid the full retail price for it.
