 MY THREE YEAR OLD SON IS JUST DISCOVERING THOMAS AND FROM READING OTHER REVIEWS AND SPEAKING WITH VETERAN MOTHERS OF THOMAS FANS I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT COLLECTING THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IS IN ORDER TO REENACT THE SCENES FROM THE VIDEOS. THIS SET MADE A NICE ADDITION TO HIS GROWING COLLECTION AND THE PRICE WAS NICE TOO. THE WOODEN TRAINS ARE A BIT EXSPENSIVE BUT ARE WELL WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE PLAYED WITH FOR YEARS TO COME UNLIKE MOST OTHER TOYS THAT CHILDREN OUTGROW OR BECOME BORED WITH ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY RECIEVE THEM
