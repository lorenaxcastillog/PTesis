 My duaghter (she just turned 2)loves the Backyardigan's (as do I) so I think that she love's just having this as a toy. However, we cannot have a pirate adventure in the tub, because the figurines cannot stay on the boat unless it is totally immobile, and even then you have to place them very carefully. They slip and slide as they are plastic and so is the boat deck. The sail constanly comes off. I have had to glue it on. We mostly play with this on the bedroom floor. Also, it would be nice if the other pirate characters were available, even at an extra cost, but I have not seen them anywhere. Argh! All in all, I am disappointed. They should be made to walk the plank for this
