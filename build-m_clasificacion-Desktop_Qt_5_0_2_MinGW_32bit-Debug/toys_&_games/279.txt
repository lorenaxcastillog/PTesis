 My daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this Christmas morning. Of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play. Her grandma and I played and I was surprised at the amount of things I have learned just from taking her to her lessons! I'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like Trivial Persuit but that was my only problem with the game. There isn't questions asked every move. But otherwise, it is an excellent game. I would definately recommend it
