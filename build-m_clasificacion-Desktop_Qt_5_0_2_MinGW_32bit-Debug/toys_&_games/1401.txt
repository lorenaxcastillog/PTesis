 My daughter has been asking for a large dollhouse since she was 4 but we waited until we knew she would be able to take care of it and use it properly. We finally decided on this dollhouse and when we got it we found the thing is made of cardboard and particle board with very few actual braces made of real wood. There isn't enough hardware to keep the thing together and it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use by my mature seven-soon to be eight- year old. She was devastated. I found a much better dollhouse by Imaginarium that is almost the same price as this. To me the extra 10.00 is worth it knowing that my daughter will have a dollhouse she can actually USE. Please don't buy this dollhouse, you will be dissapointed. Instead check out the Glitter Dreams Dollhouse or the Uptown Dollhouse both by Imaginarium
