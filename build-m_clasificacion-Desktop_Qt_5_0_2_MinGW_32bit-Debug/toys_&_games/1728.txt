 I didn't read the fine print and missed "accessory boxed set". This contains a mask, VERY SMALL cape, and light saber. It does NOT include any pants. The cape on a 4'8" boy only went down to the waist -- not down to the knees, so the label that it's one size fits all is very deceptive. Not sure why an "accessory boxed set" would include the cape and top portion of the costume. Accessories would be items like a saber gloves, and perhaps a voice changer add on. Anyway, this is a rip off and don't waste your time buying this for anyone over 3 feet tall. I'm returning this one.
