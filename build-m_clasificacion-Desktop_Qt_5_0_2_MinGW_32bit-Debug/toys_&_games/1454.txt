 My daughter is 2 years old and at first I thought it would be too big for her only to find out she was able to ride it with no problems. I also thought it would be too fast for her since it was her first battery operated ride-on. But she proved me wrong. It's like a treat to her. when her dad comes home from work he allows her to ride it down a couple of blocks with him following quickly beside her. The only thing he suggested is a helmet for safety procaution. But she really seems to enjoy it and we get a kick watching her ride it. It came pretty much assembled which was really nice to avoid the fustration of putting such a large item together. I'm very happy I made the choice to buy one and I do strongly recommend it to my other family members
