 Bought this Barbie case for my daughter and am disappointed with it. There is nothing on it at all that says or shows Barbie, it is just blah pink. The handle fell off the first day and got lost. Inside, it is very deep and has slots for the barbies to stand up in and then just a deep wasted space. No way to organize the clothes at all. The top has very shallow compartments to keep small stuff in... but they are hard for little hands to open. We just don't like it and my daughter doesn't play with it at all. An expensive mistake. :
