 I think this is a great toy. I bought this for my 3 1/2 y.o. daughter. She is not able to put the animals together herself but she can fix them and make them with me. My 5 1/2 year old son has been having a great time playing with it as well. He is already adept at lego and yet he finds the animals fun and challenging. You must save the cardboard pictures of the animals that the box is wrapped in so that you can refer to the pictures for building. My two suggestions for Duplo would be that they include a book with pictures of how to build the animals and that they include just a few more pieces so that you can build all of the animals and the refreshment stand. This set allows you to build all the animals but if you want to build the refreshment stand you will have to take a few pieces from an animal or another Duplo set. Overall - I would recommend this toy to anyone with girls or boys ages 3-6.
