 I love the room in this wagon...but the way the handle is made is dangerous. It has hit my 3 year old in the head a couple of times. It is designed to fold inwards instead of out and isn't the greatest idea. It also might just be a defective one that I received but I found it to be too tippy. Which is also dangerous. I really researched these wagons and I thought I was going to be getting the best one according to all of the reviews I have read but I am not satisfied with it at all. I am now on the working on researching some more for a new one and I decided that I would probably just be better off going to the store and personally check them out myself.
