 We bought the 'Amazing Allysen' doll for our 7 year old. Unfortunately, Allysen is more aggravating than amazing. She's a pretty doll, but we had a lot of difficulty "programming" her. You have to squeeze her hand to set the date, time, etc. No problem, right? Wrong. Her hand was so hard to squeeze, my daughter couldn't do it, so I tried to help her. Long before Allysen was fully programmed, I had to hand her to my husband. He was a little more sucessful and we now have her programmed. The other complaint I have is difficulty in communicating answers to Allysen. She doesn't seem to hear well--I know she's a doll, but the commercials showed a far more advanced Allysen than we received. She'll ask my daughter what she wants to do next and give her 2 or 3 choices--but she doesn't always understand the answer, even if it's repeated several times CLEARLY. My daughter has played with her maybe 3 times since Christmas. She says it's just too irritating. That's why I'm giving 'Aggravating Allysen' 2 stars.
