 If you and your friends are just too crazy for conventional board games, give I've Never - The Game of Truth a try. The object of the game is simple, players move around the board answering highly personal and potentially defamatory questions, and take shots or drink beer while playing. The questions are formatted as "I've Never...." (for example, "I've never been skinny-dipping"). If this is true for you, you get to move forward the designated number of spaces. If it's false, you pay the consequence (generally you must take a drink). Some spaces on the game board automatically force you to drink. Many people will find the questions far too offensive and overly personal, and will be uncomfortable playing this game. If this is you, don't feel bad, you're not the only one. However, in a group of close friends, this game can be a total laugh riot. This game is perfect for a Bachelor or Bachelorette party, or just a regular party with a group of friends who are as crazy as you are
