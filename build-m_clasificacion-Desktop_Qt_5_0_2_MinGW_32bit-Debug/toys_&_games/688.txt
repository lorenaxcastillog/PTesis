 My girlfriend and I purchased this gift as a shower gift for our friend's third child. Although, the baby technically can't use it right away, it will help her and her husband navigate life with three kids at pumpkin patches, amusement parks, fairs, walks, etc. The kids LOVE it and were really excited to explore the cooler compartment under the seats. It wasn't hard for her husband to assemble and is great quality. My friend and I will likely purchase the shade for the wagon at Christmas time. We know they will get a childhood's worth of use from it and it will help them to create wonderful childhood memories as a family
