 My daughter, age 9, purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing, backpacks etc. Upon opening and struggling to assemble it, we realized that it was useless. It is very difficult to use on paper and I can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket. I emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard - return it to the store you bought it at (an option I did not feel we had since it had been opened and used). They should have just said "tough luck (...)". Save your money, avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead.
