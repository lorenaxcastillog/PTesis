 With a 2 year old brother, our very active 11 month grandson was not always as safe as we would like him to be while needing to tend to our 2 year old. This "play fort" as we called it worked wonderfully. While potty training the 2 year old, the baby was safe but interested in the "fort". In reverse, the 2 year old used his "fort" as a private place to play without having his blocks knocked down by his baby brother. We also have used the flexible configuration to corall "play dough" time by the older child...Mom and Dad have been known to have their "time out"s in the playspace as well!!! Good product!!
