 I'm not sure who is rating this but my expectations were high for this toy based on all these raters giving this gadget 5 stars. I'm sorry to say that I don't think so. You cannot use it as a voice changer without having to record something each time. There are other voice changers that allow you to add voice effects as you speak. Not this one. That reduces the fun effect. The microphone doesn't capture the voice that well and the speakers are weak. I had to play it near someone's ear for them to hear it or tell all to stay silent. Reducing the fun even more. Some one here said that you can even clip it somewhere? No clips found. Nevertheless you can still get giggles (1st star) plus it includes batteries to play out of the box (2nd star).
