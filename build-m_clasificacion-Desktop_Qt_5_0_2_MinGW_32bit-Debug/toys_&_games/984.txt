 The train set is great. My two year old received it as a birthday present. He loves playing with it. His baby brother is mesmerized by the train. We are going to have to buy a diffrent engine for him. The both love it. I don't give it five stars because they love playing with it soo much that I have to change the batteries quite frequently. It was a battery a day. We bought a diffrent engine that required no batteries and limit the use of this engine to save on batteries. It is nice having a battery engine bacause they enjoy the train run through the tracks.
