 My daughter got this for Christmas because of her love of all things Mermaids. While overall I like the toy, I have to wonder if they did a test with actual children before production. The side with the slide sort of tilts down and seems unstable (and sometimes the slide falls off). The top comes off sometimes (would have been better if it didn't rotate). But, my daughter (4.5) and son (2.5) both enjoy it quite a bit. My daughter had Elina, and got another mermaid, 2 merfairies and a sea pixie to complete the set (she had no other barbies). Both Elina and Shella fit on the sides and Shella can sit at the table and have a drink with a merfairy. I paid $30 for this at the store in November, but even at $30, I didn't mind the price (until I saw that some of you got it for $4.99!!!). It is by far the biggest hit from Santa this year! Despite its faults, I would buy it again
