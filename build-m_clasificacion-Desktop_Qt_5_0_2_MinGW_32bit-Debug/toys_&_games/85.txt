 The concept is perfect. It is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay. The pedal mechanism is difficult to master, but doable. The steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns. I rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it. It most likely was a returned item. It was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled. I fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well. The product is very cheaply made, but the sound effects and look is perfect for a Batman lover. I have written to EToys, and I will see how they respond. My sons loved the car nevertheless
