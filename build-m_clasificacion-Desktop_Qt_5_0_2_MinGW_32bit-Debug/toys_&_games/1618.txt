 My husband and I are the kind of parents that used to think the loud flashy light toys are the best. These blocks proved us wrong. My husband ordered these blocks last year for Christmas when he was oversees among many other toys. She was only nine months so she recieved them so she just held them and chewed on them. I would stack them for her and she had a blast knocking them down. We took them out again when she was 1. She is now 17 months and hasnt stopped playing with them. They come with a plastic see through backpack for storage so she loves to put them in and take them out. She stacks them on top of each other as high as she can and then rolls over laughing after she knocks them down. And all of those expensive loud flashy toys are still sitting there collecting toy dust.
