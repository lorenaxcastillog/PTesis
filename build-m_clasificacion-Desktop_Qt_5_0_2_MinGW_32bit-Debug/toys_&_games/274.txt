 Our three children, who are now in their forties, were young when we purchased a Bozo Bop Bag for them. They loved it, used it all the time, and it held up beautifully through the years. Now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her. Same design, same wonderful quality, same use as forty years ago. Bozo is a "friend" who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up. Our 3 year old grand daughter loves him. She now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of Bozo. For toddler activity and appropriate "acting out", I thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation. It's a bit pricey, but worth 5 stars for sure
