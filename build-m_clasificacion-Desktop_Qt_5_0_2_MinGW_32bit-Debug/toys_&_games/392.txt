 My daughter is one and a half, and she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures. Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered. I'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are, and how well they are holding up. I feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and lower case. My only problem is with the tray. It only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level). I also don't like its sharp edges. My daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around. Now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin
