 Our 5 year old picked this gift out for her cousin, who is 3. A very rough and ready little boy, who still likes to put things in his mouth. I was glad to see it did not have tires that could come off in his mouth and our little girl just knew it was perfect becauce it has lights and a siren. She was right, He love his police the best. He carried it with he all night and his mom says he sleeps with it too. He does not have the tracks, buts it rolls everywhere he wants to too. Great gift for small hands
