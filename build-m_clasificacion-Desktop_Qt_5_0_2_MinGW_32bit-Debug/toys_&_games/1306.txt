 Pit is possibly the loudest family game ever. It's just a bunch of cards and a little bell, but the action turns your dining room table into a trading floor. Everyone's screaming numbers across the table at each other and holding up fingers trying to trade cards and it can get pretty boisterous. In my experience, this is not a good game for all families. Some folks are more subdued and prefer quieter evenings of discussion and relaxation. Others like it loud, and for those people I recommend this game. It's loud, but it's a blast. A frenzy of shouting and card trading for about 4 minutes and then it's all over and you play again. Big fun
