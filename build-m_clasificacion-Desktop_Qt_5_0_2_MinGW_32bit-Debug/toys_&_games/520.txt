 I-Dog is so fun to use! All you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker. I-Dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play. His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often! I-Dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to. If you don't have a digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can "hear" that way. There are only two reasons why I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars: (1) The internal speaker isn't very loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high, and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to get off. You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off
