 I should have bought this toy earlier!!!!when I first lied my eyes on this toy, I knew where my 17 dollars will go!!!! This toy was a beauty!!! the crown is soooooooo pretty that you want one too!!!and, the wand was soo cool!!you can light it up with press!Also the swappin styles are sooooo fun!!!It's feally easy to change.....Just flip it, button it, done!This toy is better looking with your own eyes.The picture showed it too wide, and eyes too small.Beleive me!I been a Barbie fan for more then 2 years!!!!!None of them broke!Buy it!You'll know what I mean by then......Hope this helps!!! Barbie fan
