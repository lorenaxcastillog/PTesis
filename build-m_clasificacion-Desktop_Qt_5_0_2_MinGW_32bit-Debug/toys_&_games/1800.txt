 Ok. Personally, I like the toa nuva better than the toa metru so I traded my Vakama figure for this one day. He is Awesom!!! I always wonder why the guys at lego took the toa nuva off the shelves, they are aewsom, too bad I only have one. Anyway, he has these cool lava swords that you can put into his leg and use as a surfbord for lava. His armor is neat and shiny and his mask is cool too. He is also the leader of the toa an the most powerful. I recomend that yoiu get this figure, it is aewsom
