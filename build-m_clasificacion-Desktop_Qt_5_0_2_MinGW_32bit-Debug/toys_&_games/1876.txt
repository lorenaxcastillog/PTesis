 I'm sad to see this toy getting such poor reviews. Yes, it does say "get out of the way" and "slow down little fella", but my DAUGHTER still loves it. The volume control on the bottom is loud and louder, and that's definitely a negative for me - of course it doesn't bother my toddler. But all in all, this toy has been great. It's been well-loved and still works like new. My toddler loves to drive, and this toy has kept her interest for over a year. Just because it's not specifically designed for education doesn't mean there's nothing to be gained. We make it educational by naming the animals, shapes, numbers, letters and colors on the toy. We also sing the songs on the "radio" - my child has gotten so good at it, that she can hit the button in rapid succession to get to the song she wants. Fun toy
