 I have a 2 month old grandson living with me, and he has cholic. Sweet boy, but he barely ever wants you to set him down. Needless to say a few of the Christmas gifts I have bought, we have pulled out to play with a little bit early. This is a wonderful toy! One of the most comforting things for my grandson is to be talked to in a soft calm voice. I saw this toy on the shelf and I am the type who pushes all the buttons to test before buying. The voice is a very soothing voice and the sweet "I love you baby" at the end is perfect! My grandson so far LOVES this toy. He doesn't take well to many, but this one has great animations and music, and keeps him interested... best of all it makes him laugh! Something he doesn't do to often yet. Of course we have to shake the rattle... but I am sure he will learn how soon enough. A definte 5 stars just to hear him laugh and smile! Recommended for any finicky child
