 I bought these shoes for my 4 yr. old daughter because she really wanted them. When we got home & opened them I could not believe the smell!!!!!!! I too thought the smell would go away but the smell is very strong & I think it would take a long time for that to happen. They are very cute shoes & I want to return them because when I woke up this morning the whole downstairs stunk like those shoes!! My daughter is so upset so now I'm in search of a different Cinderella shoe. I can't believe that they would make a shoe out of this material especially for small children! I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased them but it was not a "planned" purchase
