 Gave this to my nephew for Christmas. It's very nice. Although it's all plastic it is tough and sturdy. The directions will require patience. My nephew and I love the seatbelts(always nice to remind kids to buckle up). The battery is a pain to get to and charge which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars. I was concerned about all the reviewers who said that the traction was poor. Christmas day we took the gator outside. In order to get to the driveway my nephew would have to go up a small but steep hill. I tried to stop him so he wouldn't be disappointed if he couldn't make it up the hill. But, he just hopped in and up that hill he went. My mouth dropped open because the grassy yard was also damp. No slippage. No problem. I just looked at my sisters and laughed. It did great on the grass, gravel and side walk. As for the gears stripping I'll have to wait and see
