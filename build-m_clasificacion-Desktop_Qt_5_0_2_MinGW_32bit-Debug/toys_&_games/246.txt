 First, the Volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the Midge series of Barbie dolls, slightly smaller than regular Barbie. Another annoyance, it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic Fisher-Price replica toys that have nothing to do with the Volvo. I put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase wouldn't close. I looked on the box illustrations, and sure enough, they show a suitcase NOT CLOSED. How could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons? I just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that doesn't relate to the inherent play value of the car. Any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from Fisher-Price. Would have been nice to have a choice of colors, even approximately the REAL colors that the Volvo wagon comes in. I just wanted my granddaughter to be able to play-like with Grandma's white Volvo wagon. How hard should that be? Overall, I'm disappointed with this toy. For 28$, shipping included, I expected a better toy. Not worth the money
