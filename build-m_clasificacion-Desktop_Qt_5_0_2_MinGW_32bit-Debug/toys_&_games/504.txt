 We bought this for our five year old, and it has made art projects much more enjoyable for him. Melissa & Doug make a variety of very traditional children's products and their easel is perfect. It wasn't too hard to put it together (30 minutes), it is sturdy and has nice features. The ability to use a paper roll (paper not included) and to easily tear off pictures is very nice. The one complaint we have is that Amazon charges over twenty dollars for standard shipping. If you take a few minutes to look around on line, you can find the same easel and have it shipped for about a third the cost. In summary, the easel is worth every penney, but you should try to avoid over paying on the shipping
