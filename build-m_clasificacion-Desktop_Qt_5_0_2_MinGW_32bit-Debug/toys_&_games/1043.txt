 Why was I too cheap to buy this sooner? I waited until my 8th kid to drop the money for this well built wire rack, but have no regrets. Sturdy, durable and a space saver, sure. But after Claire is grown and the puzzles are stored for the grandkids, I can use the rack for my home office, so it is multi-use! It's just the right size for separating insurance claims, tax forms, or any other annoying stacks of paper that need to be separated and dealt with. So go ahead and spend the money on this for the baby now--you'll use it later
