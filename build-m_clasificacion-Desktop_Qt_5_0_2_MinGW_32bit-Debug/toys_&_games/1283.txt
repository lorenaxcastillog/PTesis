 The box of The 90's Game reads, "The 90's are Back." Although, I didn't think they'd really been gone all that long - I still had a tough time remembering the diner from "Saved By The Bell" (The Max, by the way). Regardless, this is much more fun than other trivia games, because even though you remember all the shows, music, movies, etc. from the past decade (as opposed to say stuff from the fities and sixties) - the answers lie in the details - which often are just on the tip of your tongue. The last time I played included a mixed group (some trivia buffs some clueless tag-alongs) and there was enough in there to please both sets. Great time had by all
