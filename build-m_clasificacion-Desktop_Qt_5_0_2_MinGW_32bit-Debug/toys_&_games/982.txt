 I was quite disappointed in the phone aspect of this toy (the hippo game is fine for a 3-year-old). The entire number pad presses as a single unit and makes a random tone with each press (you cannot press different numbers individually). Also, when you close the flip phone, it doesn't hang up like a real phone would, rather it keeps dialing/talking until it finishes its conversation. And the buttons on the outside of the phone are merely decorative (other than the phone to game switch). Also it is a bit large for a child's hand. On to the positive: the voices are fairly realistic, and not too annoying. And the hinge seems pretty sturdy, I expect it will withstand quite a bit of abuse from a child
