 Some reviewers here give these shoes a bad rap. OF COURSE you should wear a helmet and wrist guards with these shoes, just as you would with a skateboard. Then you won't be in danger of 'busting your head open,' like some reviewers warned. My 5 y.o. daughter and 8 y.o. son LOVE these shoes. They jumped and ran in them for hours - usually under my supervision. Two recommendations - 1) put on more rubber bands than recommended for your child's weight so they aren't so 'squishy', and 2) buy extra because they break kind of frequently. But well worth the active fun
