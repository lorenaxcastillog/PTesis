 My son, who is 3, loves dinosaurs and everything green. This toy was perfect. The dinosaur comes in Green and Red. I bought green for my son and gave the red one to his cousin. They have dino wars. This dinosaur moves, roars, and flashes its eyes red, which looks really cool in the dark. My son flys it around the room & uses it to attack other toys. This proved to be a such agreat toy, I bought another (#2) green dino to have my son and husband have dino fights. This toy is the best I have found.
