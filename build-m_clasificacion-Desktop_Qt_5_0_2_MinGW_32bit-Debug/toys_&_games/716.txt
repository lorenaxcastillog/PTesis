 My daughter BEGGED for this toy for Christmas..and we couldn't find it! Her birthday is early in January and we found one on Amazon. She was THRILLED with this doll. I wouldn't say it is her FAVORITE toy...but she does play with it consistently. She is 6 years old and we felt that she was too old for it at first, which is why we passed on it for Christmas. She wouldn't "let go of the dream" so we found it for her Birthday. It is sometimes a little hard to get the doll to re-set, but seriously...it's a toy!!! You can't expect it to perform miracles. For the price...it's a great doll
