 Step 2 is a fantastic brand, slowly climbing up the ladder alongside Fisher Price, Little Tikes etc. My kid loves motorcycle's, so what better toy to buy than his own ride-on motorcycle! This toy is extremely durable. It might take kids a while to get used to balancing the bike, so that it doesn't topple over - but scrapes and bruises are part of growing up! The bike is a little taller than I thought it would be, which meant that my child was on tiptoes for the first couple of months - but its a strong, cheap and exciting toy for any kid
