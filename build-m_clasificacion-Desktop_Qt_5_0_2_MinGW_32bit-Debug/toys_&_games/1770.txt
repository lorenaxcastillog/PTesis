 Boys love remote control gadgets, especially cars. However, the rc cars we have bought in the past proved far too fragile, usually losing at least the antenna on the first day. This one is definitely an exception! We bought two of these for our 9 and 11 year old boys for Christmas. They had them put together on their own by the time the batteries were charged, and have had a blast jumping them over speed bumps and ramps. The romote has three different chanels, so they can both race at the same time. They have even made a few modifications by changing pieces around and adding things from other lego sets. And talk about durable! Even our 6 year old, who is a master of disassembly, hasn't broken them! I agree that this toy is a bit pricey, but ours were the "big present" at Christmas and get lots of use. We love them
