 All of the stories offered with the Read with Me player are all great classics. This one was a new one for us, and Cameron enjoyed it. I think my son really enjoyed this story. Someone also gave him the hard back book for his birthday, and he loves this one. I think any read with me dvd offered it a great one. They are either new or timeless classics and they can learn to read, follow along while they listen or play the games relating to the story after. It makes learning fun. Buy all of them, we own them all. Great concept and I hope they offer more in the future. I think they just needed to market it better during the year before the holidays....awesome learning toy
