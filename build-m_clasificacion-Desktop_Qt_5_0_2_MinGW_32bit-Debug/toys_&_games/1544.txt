 This overall is a good toy for the price of $20, if you have the toddler doll to go along with it. But there are not very many extra reactions the doll does to this item. You can have almost as much fun with just the toddler doll. My daughter does like to write on the board, send her down the slide and just pretend she is teaching her. However, the cardboard pieces that go on this do not stay up, they fall out. I had to tape them in so they would stay. You would think it would have been stickers instead. Overall a good toy
