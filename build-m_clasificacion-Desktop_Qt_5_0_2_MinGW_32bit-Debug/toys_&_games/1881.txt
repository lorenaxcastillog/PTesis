 I bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it! She can play with it over and over, since it doesn't stick to surfaces. And if the colors all get mixed together it's like a big ball of candy sprinkles. Looks very pretty, instead of looking like some ugly mess that you get with play dough or other playing compounds. She wanted Floam, but that is a gooey sticky mess so her mom said no. I found this and it was even better! It kind of reminds me of rice crispy treats, how the marshmallows kind of string away as you break them into pieces, only not so sticky. If you are considering this for your child, they will love it! Not recommended for little ones, my daughter is 2 and she just wants to eat it
