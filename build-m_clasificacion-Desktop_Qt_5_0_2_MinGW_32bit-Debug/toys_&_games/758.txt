 I saw this toy at my [...] and decided to suprise my 3&4 year old. This was the best money I have ever spent and would have gladly paid 10x that amount. My sons have found many of their other action figures that fit into the cockpit and even have ones whose hands fit on the steering wheel. I am looking for a Batman figure but they are happy while I searching. The sounds, push button action and missle lauching is perfect for little fingers. There are so many additional features on this toy that they have made this their favorite toy. Buzz and Spiderman have now subcum to BATMAN!!!!
