 Mace Windu's legendary lightsaber was unique due to its purple crystals/blade. Subsequently, one of the first Force FX sabers I sought out from Master Replicas was this one. The appearance of the elegant hilt did not disappoint. Being one of the older Force FX sabers, it is slightly heavier/bulkier than the newer ones, and it takes 6 AA batteries instead of 3 AA or 3 AAA as the newer ones do. And unlike the typical blue, green or red Force FX lightsabers, the color is not as striking because they did not use purple LED lights. Perhaps in the future, a newer model, sleeker, lighter, brighter, with purple LEDs will be made... The sound effects are adequate, perhaps not as sharp/crisp as the newer sabers. The polycarbonate blade is sturdy, good enough for light-duty dueling. Nevertheless, this is one of the more unique designs (Master Replicas has often been chided for coming out with sabers that are too similar in design), and the entire line of Force FX sabers does not really disappoint. For Star Wars fans, a Force FX saber is a must for your inner Jedi..
