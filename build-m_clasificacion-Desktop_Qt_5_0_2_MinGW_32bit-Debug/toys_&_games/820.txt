 I bought this for my son for his first birthday. I wanted a place for him to "practice" sitting in a chair at a table. He's a little young to sit there for very long, but he will sit and eat a small snack (I stay right next to him as he hasn't mastered the dismount yet!). This set is nice for a younger child - many of the other sets looked bigger and better suited for 3 years +. When he's not sitting in the chairs, he likes to throw and push them all over the room. They are very sturdy and are holding up well to his abuse. I also like that everything folds up for easy storage
