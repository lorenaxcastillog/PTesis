 My husband and I bought this puzzle for my 2.5 year old for Christmas. After a few times of helping her put the puzzle together she now can do it by herself. I agree with other reviews about having them cut on state lines, it's a great learning tool! My daughter ( who is not even three yet) knows all the states and it working on learning the capitals. We point out where all our family lives and what states we have to go through to visit them. She can put it together and take it apart time after time, and after many times of doing this it still is in great shape. I would recommend this toy to anyone who wants a fun way to teach their little ones about the U.S.
