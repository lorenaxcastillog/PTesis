 I bought 2 of these for my kids. They love them. They can swim at night and see where there going. So far these work great. They dont fog up as bad as some of the other goggles out there. A friend of my kids was here and seen the goggles and loved them so I turned around a bought a 3rd pair of them. As I said, so far there great. We have had them almost a month now. They do take 4 AAA batteries but otherwise there great. The plastic is not the really soft kind that moves and lets water in. They kinda mold to your face to keep water out. I have even tried them and like them better than alot of others. They are shaped as to slightly impair your vision on the sides since they do stick out some on the sides. Overall, they are great so far. The only reason I gave it 3 stars on education is it just depends if you take your child to the beach or some place like that
