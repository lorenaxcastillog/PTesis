 This has become the favorite game in the house - the kids can't get enough of it. They enjoy buying property such as Tia Dalma's shack or the Black Pearl. The only things I would have done different was instead of making it with the traditional Monopoly Jail, I would have put the Port Royal Prison there and instead of the Policeman, perhaps put Commadore Norrington or the Gov. And of course the Free Parking Space should have been Free Docking or something similar. The pewter pieces are pretty cool as well even though there are no "human" characters. Definately a must have for POTC fans who also enjoy board games
