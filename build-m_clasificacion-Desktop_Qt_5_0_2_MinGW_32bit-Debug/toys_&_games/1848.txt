 We bought this for my son for Christmas when he was 18 months old and he still loves it (8 months later). All of his friends love it too. He has a plethora of toys, but still pulls this one out daily. Some of the previous reviews mentioned that the tubes were pretty tight and almost difficult for the little one's to pound, so we passed the balls through the tubes a few dozen times before we gave him the gift. It helped and the toy was a hit. This toy has helped with eye-hand coordination as well as color identification. I would definitely recommend this toy
