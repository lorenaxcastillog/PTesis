 I would have never bought this item if I had read the other poor reviews first. The toy is made of very cheap looking plastic and it is much smaller than it appears on the box. The pieces just do not fit like the box displays them (what appears to be a large command center where the transformer can slide down the wire is just a little over an index finger long). I wish I could take it back but my son has already broken a couple of the cheap pieces. My 4-year old was so disappointed because he could not stop talking about how this would be the first toy he would play with on Christmas Day
