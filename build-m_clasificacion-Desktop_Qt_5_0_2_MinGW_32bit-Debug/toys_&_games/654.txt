 I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it. It is a nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space. She can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated. Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box. My only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I know as she gets older, it will become easier. I would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child
