 We hadn't played any of the new DVD games until this past weekend. At one party we played Shout About Movies and RIFF. We hated Shout About (and I am posting our review of that!) and we LOVED Riff. Riff is completely on the DVD. You play in teams and use the DVD remote. The best part was the Battle of the Bands questions which went on and on with people screaming and laughing. The High or Lower and Fact or Wack parts of the game are the most original stuff we have seen. LOVED THIS. Then there are music videos, picture questions, music. What was really great was how much stuff about current music was in this game. And how much stuff we managed to actually remember. There was other stuff too. A look inside the Hard Rock collection was very cool. So was the poster that is included. But the star was the game. We went out and bought our own copy the next day. We can't wait to play it again (this weekend.) Riff is amazing!!!
