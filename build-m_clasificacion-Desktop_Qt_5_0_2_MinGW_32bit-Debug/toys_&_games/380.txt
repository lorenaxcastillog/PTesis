 My three year old takes a "rest" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity. He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over. In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up. It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up. He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more "is it time yet?". I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!
