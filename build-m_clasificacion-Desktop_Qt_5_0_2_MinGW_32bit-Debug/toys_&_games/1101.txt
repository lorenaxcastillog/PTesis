 We purchase one for our 6 year old daughter. She was brought up on real boats and jetski's. We were undecided how we felt about this, but she saw the commercial and wanted it. I think its the best thing ever. Yes it goes slow, but what do you expect for 39.99 you can't buy anything motorized for that. We live on the lake and she has no problems at all so don't let the "POOL USE ONLY" scare you. To her its the best thing ever. I could have boughten a []$ air matress and I'm sure it wouldn't last any longer than this. Its a cheap thrill for a kid
