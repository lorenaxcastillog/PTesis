 The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim. My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad. Batteries: this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell. Volume: the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low. I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting. My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones. We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then
