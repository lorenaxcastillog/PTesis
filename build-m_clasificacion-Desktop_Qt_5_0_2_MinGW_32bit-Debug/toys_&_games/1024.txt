 I was excited to see that there was an electronic hand held version of the Sudoku puzzle. I found the numbers to be rather small and finding where your curser is can be hard at times so I make sure I always leave it off in an empty space. The navigation arrows are a little touchy. You have to be pressing in the right place or sometimes you may think you are going left and the curser is going down. I enjoy having it and use it often but I am almost thinking I would rather have the paper version as this one doesn't allow you to make mistakes. For instance if you have a 6 already in that row and you try to put one somwhere else in that row it won't let you and part of the challenge is making mistakes that messes the whole puzzle up if not caught on time
