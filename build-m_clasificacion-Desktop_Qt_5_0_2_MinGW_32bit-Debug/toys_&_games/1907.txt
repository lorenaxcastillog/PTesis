 My sister and I played this game every night for about two months. It's almost exactly like the game Yhatzee, but it has colors thrown in. There is a list of sets to get like: three of a kind, all the same color, two pair. After you roll, you pick which dice you want to roll again. You roll a total of 3 times to see if you can get any of the sets. It's so fun because it's so basic. Not a lot of rules to remember. We usually play about 3 games a night. Also good for travel since you really only need the dice and the score cards (maybe the rolling cup). Not good to play when your parents are trying to sleep though! Dice are really loud when rolling them in the cup. Really fun game
