 Just in case you wonder if it's another collection, it's the same metal cars as in the "normal" or regular edition. It's only from another country or provider (I guess). But they have the brilliant idea to develop more cars from the movie. Well, not more cars but more variant models. For example, they have this version of McQueen (as it looks in the last part of the movie). They have the first Mater (not the re-colored one from the bowling game) with the complete nose (you get that), Dirt mcqueen (like the one from one track game), Hudson hornet! yellow ramone. I has uploaded the back cover of the box just for your entertainment. It has the whole catalog! In Peru it costed me $9 each but they are so hard to get. As it happened here they just disappeared from the regular stores.
