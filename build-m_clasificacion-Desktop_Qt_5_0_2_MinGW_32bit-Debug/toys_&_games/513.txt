 Every child I know loves animals and this is no exception. My three-year-old granddaughter loves to have the puppies get nurtured by the mother dog in her dollhouse. She loves to brush the mother dog's "fur" too. I sometimes play with her and we talk about how to treat animals gently and with kindness. I see her using these traits in her role play with this set. Everything about this set is durable. There is even a sack of dog food and a water dish to remind little ones that all animals need to be taken care of. When I sometimes watch my granddaughter, she will always notice when his food or water dish is empty and come tell me. I notice her giving her "pets" the same consideration. I love this set and so does she!
