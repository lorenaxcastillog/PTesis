 [...] My sister and I thought we would be able to Instant message using these across the neighborhood. So we split up, loading the "chips". To our displeasure, we had to walk all the way back, switch "chips" and put them in. This is not a very good toy. First, you have to annoyingly scroll through each letter. For example, to type in a y, you have to press the select button 25 times and enter it, so messages take AT LEAST 5 minutes. Then you have to physically HAND these little chips to your friends. It would be 100x easier just to talk to them. There are a ton of little gadgets like these, but this has to be one of the worst. You are better off just talking or buying another toy of this nature, as nobody wants to walk, switch "chips" and walk away.
