 We gave this toy to our 4 year old son. That was 1 1/2 years ago. It worked at first, but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit. After about 1 month, the balls did not pop up at all. Little Tikes replaced it with a completely new toy. Again, it worked for a few months, but now it does not work. The beeps sound (a nice feature), but nothing happens. My son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand. Most of the balls are lost. Thank goodness I only paid $10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much
