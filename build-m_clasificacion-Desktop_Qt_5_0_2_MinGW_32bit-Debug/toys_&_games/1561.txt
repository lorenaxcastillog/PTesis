 We attached the Imaginative Minds keyboard to an extra computer we had and put it in the children's playroom. They love it! Teaches them colors, what color combinations make (red & yellow make orange!), shapes and they love the music. The initial software is a bit limited for older children (we have a 1, 2 and 4 year old that use this)but just fine for the younger one. The buttons are nice and large for little hands to manipulate but I think the children were a little disappointed that the phone didn't work and I fear it will be lost quickly since it is not attached. All in all a little pricey but a very solid and entertaining product. Definitely a plus that you can switch to other language as well!
