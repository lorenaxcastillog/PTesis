 This was a gift to an editor friend of mine. I had no idea what to get a guy for the Holidays until he mentioned he had loved archade games in his youth. After many hours editing on his computer, to decompress he will go to the Arcade TV Game System. A day doesn't go by that he doesn't thank me for it. He says he zones out and lets his hands and eyes guide his game. The only problem the unit my have is the weird grip on the stick shift, but it's all good. He has friends that come over to play with it too. He's become a very popular 45 year old.
