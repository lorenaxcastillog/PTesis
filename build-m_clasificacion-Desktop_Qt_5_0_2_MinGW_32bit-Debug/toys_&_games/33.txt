 My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and I must say we were terribly disappointed! This "sand" did nothing but make a huge mess of our play room. There was dust everywhere and nothing the kids tried to make stayed together. UGH! As it is "sand," when it gets on the floor, there is no way to easily pick up the pieces except with a broom or vacuum. We put it on newspaper to contain the mess, but boy was that a mistake. Wet newspaper and dry sand............ We're going to take it back and get some good, old-fashioned Play-Doh instead
