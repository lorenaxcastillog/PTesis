 This toy lives up to its name! The Big Bubbler trully makes the most ennormous bubbles ever! It's a blast when we take it to the park.. kids gather from all around! It makes 4-5 foot bubbles but they break into smaller bubbles. Even so, it still makes the BIGGEST bubbles I have ever seen! It can be messy to use and the bubbles tend to not last long when the solution gets foamy from frequent dipping. My suggestion... When it is time to add more solution. Tap or fling ALL of the foam out of the container before you refill. This seems to help eliminate some of the foam.
