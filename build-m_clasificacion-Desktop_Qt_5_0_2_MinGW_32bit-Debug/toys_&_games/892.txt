 My daughter received this dollhouse for her second birthday last March, and it was a big hit! 7 months later, I can tell you that she plays with it every day, and uses her little plastic dora figures to have parties in the house with the mommy and daddy and baby figures. She loves the sounds from the house, the computer, the toaster and the baby sounds. Our dollhouse has taken a lot of abuse, from being dropped multiple times, pushed off the table and such, and still looks great and works fine. What I like about it, is that unlike the overpriced and incomplete Dora dollhouse, all the parts come with this one, and fit neatly in the house, even when folded up. For the price, this is a durable, entertaining, educational and well made toy
