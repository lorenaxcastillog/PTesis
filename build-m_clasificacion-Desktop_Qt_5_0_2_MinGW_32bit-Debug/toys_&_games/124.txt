 Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff. Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old. PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer
