 This is a great set for kids with imagination. NOT for the uninspired child. Get Lego's if that is the case, cheaper and the box shape is easy to play with. But if you have an over achiever as I do this is it. Lego's bore my son to tears. Not enough peices in it but I guess its thier way of getting you to buy more. The price is way to much for what you get. But my son does love them. If you lose a couple of peices which will happen because they are small, you cant make alot of the things in the book. Still good fun. If you can get over the price you'll be happy with these
