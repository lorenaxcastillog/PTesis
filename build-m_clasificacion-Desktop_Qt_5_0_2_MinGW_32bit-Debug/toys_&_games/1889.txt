 This set is composed of five main sub assemblies and the dragon, and should take 4 hours (or more) to complete. It comes with six mini-figures and has a number of operational catapults, an inner keep, and a main gate. LEGO's integration of Technic parts has never been better than in the last few years, and like all of their recent sets, the number one feeling one gets is one of extreme cleverness. (At one point building this set I said aloud "this is exactly what the Vikings would have done if they had had Technic parts back then.") As concerns the rest of this series, the ship is similarly awe inspiring and the boat, catapult, and wolf sets make excellent additions to the battlefield. The only thing one could wish for is an enemy series to pit the Vikings against. Though all of the mythical creatures are well designed and look impressive, it would be nice to array the Viking sets (boats especially) against a competing force, and none of the current sets are a good match
