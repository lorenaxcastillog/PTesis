 I bought this doll for my daughter for christmas and she was so excited, however in the last three days I have found that this doll was not worth the price. The paint on the lips has already worn off, the eye lashes are falling out and it is difficult to keep the face clean, no matter how many times a day we wash it. It has also stopped drinking when the bottle is placed into it's mouth. I know of several other girls that are friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we are. If my daughter didn't love this doll some much I would return it for something worth it. I guess if you are just intrested in making your child happy this is a good product however for the money I would suggest something else.
