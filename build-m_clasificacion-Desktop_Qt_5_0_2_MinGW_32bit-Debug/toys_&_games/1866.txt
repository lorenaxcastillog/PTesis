 I didn't have any trouble with software, and my son's name was on the list. Someone else claimed it doesn't have an on/off switch, but that's not true, it's on the internal box that you plug into the computer. The main problem with this toy is the same problem with a lot of electronic toys. It doesn't really do much, and nags your child constantly to play with it. It will tell your child when it's time for lunch or a nap or something, but it's not like they're going to be carrying around 24/7 so they're around to hear it. Mostly what it does is say "let's keep playing, shall we? Squeeze my hand." Then when you do, it proclaims it likes the same food or animal that your child likes. Then it asks to have it's hand squeezed again. My son is probably a little young for it, but I can't see him getting all that much fun out of squeezing a teddy bears hand over and over and listening to it be an electronic yes-man. It's not a terrible toy but you're probably better off with toys that engage your child's imagination
