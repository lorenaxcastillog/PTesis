 My husband and I bought this bed for my step daughter and does she love it or what!! We only get to see her every other week so the set-up was worth seeing her face and knowing she would have her very own "princess bed"! The only problem was that the diretions do not tell you to put the 4 pieces together before inflating them. We figured it out soon enough! She is 5 years old and fits very comfortably in the bed. Air mattresses lose their value, as we know, but we feel that with this bed, being a weekend warrior, she will be able to enjoy her "princess bedroom" for quite awhile without losing any valuable sleeping time!
