 We purchased the lady bug version of this float, and are very happy with it. My daughter loves the water thanks to this float, and is well supported. At 11 months old, the size is good, there's still plenty of room to grow, and she seems quite comfortable in the mesh seat. The only downside of this float, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars, is that it is difficult to inflate and deflate. Be prepared to huff and puff vigorously to get the air in. Once deflated, it does fold up nicely and comes with a mesh storage bag. Note that this float is intended to ONLY support baby, not older siblings hoping to hang on for a ride
