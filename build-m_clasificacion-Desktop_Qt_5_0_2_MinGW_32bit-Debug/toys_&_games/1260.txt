 I remember the first paddle pool, we had fun with it then. Some of the trouble with the first game have been fixed, like the paddle getting stuck at the side because the paddle was too long. The tabs that held paddle are gone, which is what broke off in our first game many years ago, and have been replaced with a snapping system. You do have to assemble this game, so that is different, but it plays just as fun. My brother and I are having great fun reliving the greatness of this game while we share it with our children who are have an equal amount of fun. If you want a lot of action and fun this is a must have game...I am so glad have it and that Amazon offers it at such a great price
