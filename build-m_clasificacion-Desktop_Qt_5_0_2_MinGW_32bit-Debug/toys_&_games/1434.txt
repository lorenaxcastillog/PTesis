 There are many "versions" available for the Anakin Skywalker Ep 3/Luke Skywalker Ep 4 & 5 Force Fx light saber. This version, the Episode 3 saber, is one of the most elegant. The hilt is a near-exact replica of the movie prop, only being very slightly wider and longer than the authentic hilt, to accomodate the circuitry/electronics/batteries. As one of the "newer generation" of FX sabers, it only requires 3 AA batteries. The sturdy polycarbonate blade is brilliant blue. The power-up, idle hum, and clashing sounds are loud and crisp, and the total package inspires the imagination. Alas, the hilt design and weight does not make this saber the easiest to spin, and the location of the power switch sometimes makes it prone to accidentally turning off the blade while manuevering or spinning the saber. A minor drawback to one of the most eclectic Force FX sabers; this is the saber that transcends the trilogies, if you will, passed from the fallen Chosen One to his son, as with the hope he would be redeemed...
