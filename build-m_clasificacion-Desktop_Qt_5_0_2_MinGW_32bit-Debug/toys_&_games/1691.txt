 While this TV game has cartoon-like graphics,it is a lot better than the DVD game. It is a lot faster and the cases are all lined up where you can see which ones you have and haven't opened. You can also start a career mode where you can keep track of how much money you have won total. It also has a bonus round at the end of the game where you can win more money,even as much as $1,000,000. The game also features the voice of Howie Mandel and all of the sounds and music from the show. This is definitely worth the money, unlike the incredibly slow DVD game. The only bad thing about the game is that Howie repeats the same thing several times in one game and it starts to get old. But considering how small the controller/console/game is,I'm just glad it can have voicework and music in it. Definitely recommended to anyone who loves the show
