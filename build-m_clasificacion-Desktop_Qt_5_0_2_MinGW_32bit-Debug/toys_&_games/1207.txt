 I bought this set for my friend's daughter's birthday. She is 8 and loves the set. My 8 y/o daughter also loves all her Littlest Pep Shop toys and we have never had a complaint with anything. But her daughter apparently broke the head off of the dog that comes with this set and the dog, which is supposed to catch a frisbee, is sold exclusively with the set. I would like to help her get it replaced but since I misplaced the receipt I think they are stuck. Still - these toys have been great fun for the girls and it isn't a complaint about the quality of the toys
