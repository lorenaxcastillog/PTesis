 During Christmas, I bought this puzzle to entertain my 5,6 and 8 year old nieces and nephews while my sister cooked dinner. I am not a puzzle person, but thought it might keep them busy and teach them something at the same time. I was right. What surprised me is how much fun I had as a 29 year old completing the puzzle! I was shocked by how little geography I knew. During the holidays, we had a ball completing the puzzle and have saved it. Each time I come over, we go and look at the puzzle to identify new places members of our family have traveled. Great product
