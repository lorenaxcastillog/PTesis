 This climber isn't the one I initially wanted to buy, but after visiting three different Toys R Us Stores and not finding the one I wanted, I "settled" for this one, and I am so glad I did. The assembly really isn't so bad if you do like the instructions suggest and use liquid dish soap. I probably used about half a bottle of Dawn, but it made the pieces slip right together. My husband was at work so I did it all myself, and in total it took me no more than 20 minutes. Our two year old loves it. The tunnel and different sized slides make for different challenges. Plus this climber has a variety of ways to assemble it, so you can change the arrangement of the slides and tunnel. I run a daycare center with children ages 2 - 5 and they all love it. It even keeps the school aged kids entertained. Little Tikes has once again proven their commitment to fun, durable toy
