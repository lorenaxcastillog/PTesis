 This year my baby girl was old enough (16mths) to have some fun in the pool, so I spent considerable time doing research on a good pool float for her. After reading many positive reviews, I decided to order this one, and was very pleased with it. My daughter was able to splash in the water, and while she did try to crawl out of it a few times, that usually happend when she was tired of being in the water anyway. It was easy to inflate, and only took a few minutes of effort to deflate for storage. Tip, practice a few times twisting it up to put away, it can be kinda tricky. Overall, I would definitely recommend this produc
