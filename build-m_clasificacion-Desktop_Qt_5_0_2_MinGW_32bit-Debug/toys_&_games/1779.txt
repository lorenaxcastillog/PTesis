 I purchased this little beauty for a school play. One of my male students had to age from the beginning of the play to the end, and the easiest way to make a male age is to add facial hair--right? This mustache is superior to other mustaches because of the fact that you don't have to use glue to put it on, and there's no adhesive on the back to lose stickiness with repeated use. It simply clips to your nose!!! Genius! Naturally, anything that clips to your nose isn't going to be the MOST comfortable thing--but I seriously doubt anyone who purchases this product intends on wearing it for 8 hours at a time. Buy this product (or buy 2 or 3)--it's great
