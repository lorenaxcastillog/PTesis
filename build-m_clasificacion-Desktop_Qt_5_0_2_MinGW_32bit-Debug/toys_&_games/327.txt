 This product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the UK as a great teaching tool. It was well received as a gift by the children and their parents. An excellent math teaching tool that the children love. It is portable, user friendly and has something for those on many different levels, so much so that one father, an engineer, loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son, as well as a game that they can play together. Math Whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge
