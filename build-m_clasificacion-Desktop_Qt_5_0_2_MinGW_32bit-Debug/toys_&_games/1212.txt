 My mother bought this set in Illinois for my 2 year old who loves dinosaurs for Christmas. After he opened this present he didn't want to open anymore and actually cried when we took him outside to see the go-kart Grandpa had bought him. The day after we came home our dog ate the two biggest dinosaurs and about 4 others. My son cried himself to sleep over it. I went to every toy store in Indianapolis looked everywhere online, and had my mother go to every place she could find in Illinois and this toy was sold out everywhere. I have finally found another set and I have never seen my son happier. He will sit for hours playing with this set. He has almost every toy imaginable and all he wants is three or four of these "saurs" as he calls them to take everywhere with him and he is happy. He even sleeps with the big ones. This toy is great and at a good price there are so many in the box I was surprised. I love this toy. It is great for any kid who loves dinosaurs!
