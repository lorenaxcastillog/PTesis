 This should make any little girl (2 yrs-6 years) very happy! I certainly do not expect it to "last" but it comes from a reputable company, was packaged properly, and is 100% as described. What a great price, too! It did take about an hour to inflate with the foot pump. That was the hardest part, but other than that my daughter loves it and it will work great for sleepovers and as a temporary bed while we have guests using her room during the holidays. It also makes a great catch-all for stuffed animals. The best part is the sheer size of this, it really is quite big
