 Apples to Apples really is the best game I've ever played - and I've played many a game. This game is especially fun when the players are mildly intoxicated (drink responsibly). It is a great game to play with people you know really well, but is also fun to play with total strangers, and even children really like it. I am 27, and I always bring it with me to parties - my friends are so used to me bringing it that when I show up, they ask, "Where's Apples to Apples?" This game is more creative, entertaining, thought-provoking, and laughter-inducing than any other game I've ever played. It forces you to think like your opponents. It would make a great gift for anyone - young or old.
