 My baby is 12 months old. We have had this toy for 3 months. He plays with the characters all the time, esp elmo. he loves to put Elmo on the island and anything else that will fit. My one complaint with this toy is only Elmo and the tree have secure fitting space on the island. All the other pieces slide off the island at the slightest touch or bump. Other than that it has not molded and the island has not taken on water as one reviewer reports theirs did. I wish the manufacturers would make the peices fit together better
