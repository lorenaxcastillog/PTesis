 This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while. I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction! We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!) For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses. The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't. And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed. If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable. One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges
