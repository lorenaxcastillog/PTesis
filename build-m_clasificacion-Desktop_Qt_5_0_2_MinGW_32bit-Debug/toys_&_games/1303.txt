 As a child, I played this game on family vacations. The rules are simple, yet engaging. Adults and kids alike play on pretty equal ground. Kids like the high-energy pace, and adults are amused by the idea of "cornering the market." Maybe I say that because my father is a stock broker so it is great hearing his over the top analysis after each game. I can't really think of anything negative to say, except maybe that your children might grow up, like me, with an inflated sense of the value of wheat (the most valuable commodity in the game)
