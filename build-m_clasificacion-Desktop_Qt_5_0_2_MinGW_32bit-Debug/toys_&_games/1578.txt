 This was a very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter. We were able to return it, so we're happy with Amazon - but it's a bummer of a toy. The problem is that the controllers work so poorly - when you try to use them, you have to keep pressing the buttons over and over and over again to get the signal to register on the DVD player. A very frustrating experience. Not sure if something was wrong with our particular controllers, or if they all work that way. Another bad feature is that if your child wants to take the game to a friend's house - they have to spend 10 - 15 minutes reprogramming the controllers all over again to work on the friend's particular DVD player
