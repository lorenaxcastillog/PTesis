 Since Matchbox is now a Mattel item, these are the same as the 24 car Hot Wheels cases found at Target every other year (it seems). These are far superior to what the Hot Wheels line has right now. They have a "throw back" design of a black wheel and they have the dreaded 100 car case on wheels. Both of those allow the cars to bang around on the hard sides and scratch them. These are the classic soft trays that stack. Even has a couple slots for longer cars. With the exception of eBay, this is the only place I've found this type of case. Excellent for your redlines or the latest from the pegs
