 This was a real fun game. Easy to learn for the whole family. We even had our five year old intereseted and playing along. The best thing about this game is the arbitrary nature of how the winning card is chosen. It can be completly random. Some of the cards laid down for a given question can be really wacky making for a fun and entertaining experience for young and old alike. We litteraly had ages ranging from 5 to 76 playing one night and everyone was laughing and having fun. The crate edition is made of very strudy wood which should ensure the game will be kept in good shape longer than in a cardboard box. The game is worth every penney..
