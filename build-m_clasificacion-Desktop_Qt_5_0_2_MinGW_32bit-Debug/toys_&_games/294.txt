 I bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last Christmas at a fancy toy store. This product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this. The marble runs are easy to build, sturdy and so much for them to play with. There are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more "fun" and cool looking marbles as they raced them down. The kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect. I LOVE THIS TOY!!!! My kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time. You do need a hard surface to build on, since we didn't have a "train table" we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet, that way you don't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..
