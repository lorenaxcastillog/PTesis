 You know, I found this game to be quite annoying (there is a lot of singing in between each players turn)- but my 5 year old son loves it. There is no dice, no spinner (so none of those pieces to lose :), but it tells you how many spaces to move. So, one player with an easy question may get to move 8 spaces, while a player with a hard question only gets to move 3 spaces. I guess that's a plus because you can't cheat (it even tells you which color you land on), but in the process, it makes the game rather simple. My son would rather play by himself so that he doesn't lose. The questions are not challenging for my son (he just turned 5 in May), so i guess it gives him a since of "Hey! I'm smart, I know all of this stuff"
