 My four year old saw the advertisements for this game system right before Christmas(2006). I wasn't sure if I should get it for him because of his age but was willing to give it a try since he has proved me wrong before. My son absolutely loves this game system as much as his V. Smile. He plays both of them and still wants more game for each. I was very surprised at the type of things the children learn with this game system. Imagine my surprise to see my four year old locating the continents on a map of the world while playing this game. I highly recommend this game to all parents.
