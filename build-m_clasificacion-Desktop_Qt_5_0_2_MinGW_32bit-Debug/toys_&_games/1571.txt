 This thing looks like a great idea, but there are fundamental design flaws. My 7 year daughter waited for the full 10 weeks to receive her "free" tadpole ($6 shipping and handling), and, on day one, we found it had jumped out of the water, and ended up between the plastic layers and died. She was so bumbed. So, we then purchased a firebelly frog, which eats crickets. The crickets are now doing the same thing, jumping to the edges, and falling between plastic layers. We're going to replace this thing with a regular 10 gallon tank. I do admit, the frog looks darn cute in this habitat, but for practicality, it's just not going to work
