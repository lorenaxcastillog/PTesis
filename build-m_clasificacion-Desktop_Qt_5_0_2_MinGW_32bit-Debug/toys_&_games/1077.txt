 The set comes in a nice box - important if you are considering gift giving. Looks very nice in the box. The pieces are the same somewhat brittle plastic that is always used for toy swords. They will not stand up to hacking at a rock for instance, but they are fine for waving around like crazy. And they are hard enough to really hurt if your two year old gets ahold of one and starts slashing. For the five year old I purchased these for however, they are perfect. Two different sizes of swords and then the protective gear make it a nice set. The helmet is too small for children much older than five but the weapons look good enoght to entice slightly older kids. Glad I bought it, would have been worth it even at the original $12.00 price
