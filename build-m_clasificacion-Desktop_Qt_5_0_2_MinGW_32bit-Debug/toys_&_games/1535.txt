 My daughter had been begging for this toy. she is in the third grade so i thought maybe she would out grow it to fast so i put it off hoping she would forget about it.but she did not so for her 9th bday i got it for her. all of her friends were like alright now you have it too. because apparently they all already have it. well anyhow she does play with it alot but not as much as my 3 year old son. he loves the little farret and the hamsters. he puts them in the wheel and spins it. he also like to put them in the tunnel witch pops apart so if they get stuck it is easy to get out. anyhow it was well worth the money they both love it and it was the hit of the party. and there were about 15, 8,9 and 10 year old girls
