 Our son received this toy for his first birthday. It has a lot of good features--teaches colors, numbers, farm animals and their sounds, several songs. But the music is AWFUL--the singer is off-key on every single song (either that, or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice). As someone who appreciates music, I cannot tolerate listening to this, especially since there are far better toys out there. Since our son already has 2 LeapFrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy (the Learning Table, which has much better quality music, and the Fridge Farm), we will be exchanging the Vtech Discovery Nursery Farm for a different toy
