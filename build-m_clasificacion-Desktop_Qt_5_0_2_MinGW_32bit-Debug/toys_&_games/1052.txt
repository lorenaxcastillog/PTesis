 I purchased all 3 wooden meal sets (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) from another company, and paid considerably more. The prices given here are an incredible deal for such cute, well made toys! The food fits in the tray, kind of like a puzzle, which is a really fun feature. And all the food included is SO CUTE! It's wooden which makes it cuter and more durable than a lot of those plastic food sets. I love the little cups of orange juice and milk...and the bowls of cereal (looks like Fruit Loops) and soup! The sets are so cute and have an old fashioned charm to them. I can't emphasize enough how much my kids (ages 2, 4, and 7) and I love playing with these!!! I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with these, especially at these prices! Thank you, Melissa and Doug, for such a cute, fun, well made product!!
