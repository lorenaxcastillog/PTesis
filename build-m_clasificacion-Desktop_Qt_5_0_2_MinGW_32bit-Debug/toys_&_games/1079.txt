 I was ELATED to discover the culinary masterpiece that is Hasbro REAL MEAL OVEN Refills. As a career woman on the go, I'm frequently short on time, and these Real Meal options provide me with variety, taste, and economic value. Not all of us have time to go to Costco to purchase 'ketchup' for our pasta, nor do we have the hours expendible to dabble in La Rousse Gastronomique's ample pages for recipes. After a board meeting w/ the Donald, I am far too exhausted, hungry and emotionally drained to do more than switch on a lightbulb, therefore, these Real Meals are so good, I'd swear, Julia Child's ghost has been visiting my kitchen; leaving me scores of ectoplasmic treats. Zagat Survey would rate this item 30 out of 30 for decor, taste and price, I assure you, you would not be disappointed, either. One would be remiss to pass up such an exquisite banquet
