 We LOVE our tea party game! The real fabric tablecloth is a nice touch, and is creased deeply enough to be folded the same way when it is returned to the box. The game pieces are sturdy enough for plenty of pretend play, and the box becomes a tea tray for the remaining teatime items. Each plate, cup, sandwich, fruit, and dessert looks different from one another, so instead of skipping a turn when a child already has an item they may to trade it for a like item just to keep things interesting. The game lasts just long enough to stay fun. An added bonus at our house is that it not only eschews licensed characters like Dora or Barbie-- it even has art by renowned children's book illustrator Lizzy Rockwell
