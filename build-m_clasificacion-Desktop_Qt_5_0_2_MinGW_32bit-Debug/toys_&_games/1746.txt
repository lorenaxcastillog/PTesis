 I really wanted to know the dimensions before I decided on this table, but I went ahead and ordered it to find out. For others who are interested in this table they are 54x33x17. It is not as tall as the other table I was also looking at but I decided to keep it anyway. I was concerned it would not be sturdy enough since it didn't have a shelf underneath. It is very sturdy and heavy! I like that the table surface is solid green so my son can play different things on the table. The storage box is large and nice. It holds a lot, fits under the table, and can be used as a seat. The reason I didn't give this produce 5 stars is because the directions for the table, box, and train set were not very clear. However, after we figured them all out we were very satisfied with the product.
