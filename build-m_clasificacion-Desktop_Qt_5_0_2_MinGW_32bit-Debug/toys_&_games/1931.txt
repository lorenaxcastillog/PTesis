 I loved this product! It was relatively easy and quick to assemble and in my opinion, it's the sturdiest wagon on the market. I had one of these Radio Flyer wagons as a small child, given to me by my father, and I cherished it. Buying it again (it was lost in a move) as an adult was nostalgic. The only caution I would give to would-be buyers is to be certain about which product you are buying. For example, I confused this product (the Radio Flyer Big Red Classic ATW) with the Radio Flyer Big Red Classic. (The main difference between the two models is the tires.) I thought I had purchased the "classic" with the skinny non-inflatable tires, but instead got this product, with "all terrain wheels", which come inflated. No biggie- this one is more practicle, anyways, but if you're concerned about getting the "original" model, look closely at the product decriptions.
