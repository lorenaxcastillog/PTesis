 I needed a set of juggling scarves and balls for each member of an elementary school jugging club and was amazed that this combo pack allowed me to do it for about $10 per kid - the best I could do on jugging sites was about $16/kid. We have used the equipment for 4 months now and have found it to be sturdy. The only minor complaint is that the dye on the scarves sometimes comes off on our sweaty hands, so I'm not sure what would happen if the scarves got wet. Despite that, the scarves remain attractive. I thought the DVD that came with the combo was cool, but haven't heard any feedback from the kids about it. We also have a set each of Duncan clubs and rings which have been in use for over a year and they too have been a great value.
