 I'll admit I bought this for my 4 year old who not only blows into it but throws it and bangs it agaisnt the TV. So although he wanted it I probably should've waited a few years to show him just how cool the trumpet is. I think kids who show signs of interest in music will enjoy it. It actually sounds like a harmonica but what do you expect for $14. Still, the valves do work and produce different notes so that's really the point to it. Getting them familiar with how an instrument works. They even have a musical pieces on the back of the box with color coded notes so your young Dizzy Gilepsie and can follow along. Aw go ahead a grab it, why not? My son Miles approves of this message. P.T. Texa
