 I was a big fan of the original Hot Rod toy, and I've become a big fan of this rendition of Rodimus as well. The transformation isn't complete in the picture here, as the spoiler can be turned upwards as in the original toy. A lot of thought went into the design of the toy, and the detail on it is impressive. My three-year-old also loves playing with the toy. My only concern is that the legs lock into place when in car mode, and the tabs that hold it in place can bend the plastic on the outside of the vehicle if you're not careful. It's a great toy for a great price and comes highly recommended
