 I bought this for my 2 year old. I was happy that it wasn't huge--fits right in the corner. She loved it when she first got it for Christmas. HOWEVER, My complaints are...everything is just SO small and inefficient! The "microwave" is so high that she can't even reach it with a small stool I bought for her to use just for the kitchen! The back of the little bins are open, and you can't store ANYTHING in there. So, I don't know where they came up with the lots of storage line! I just expected a little bit more of a kitchen--would have changed some of the features. OVERALL it has proven to be a fun toy, but hard to use unless you are really tall
