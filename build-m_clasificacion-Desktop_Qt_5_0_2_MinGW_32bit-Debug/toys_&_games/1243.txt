 While I wouldn't consider myself an expert on games, I certainly play my share of them, and have freinds who take gaming seriously. Settler's of Catan became our favorite when we opened the box and remains so to this day. The various expansions you can buy for this game (Knights, Seafarers, etc.) only make it more enjoyable and strategic. There is the right balance of strategy, luck, complexity and risk in the game, which makes it so enjoyable. The aspect of trading resources with other players--the interactivity of it--also sets it apart. The only downside is that it takes at least 90 minutes to play a game, longer the more people are playing. But it's well worth the investment. I really can't say anything else about the game in a negative way. It's fun with friends, it's fun with your family. All right, enough already...I gotta go play
