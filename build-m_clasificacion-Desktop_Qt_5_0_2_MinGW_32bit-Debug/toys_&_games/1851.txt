 This is a fun game, but to play at the more challenging levels you have to build some machines (like a scale, race car, ramp)that are used over and over in the game. Unfortunately, the materials provided are not very sturdy. The dowels were too big to fit into some of the required pieces and consequently,my husband broke one of the dowels trying to force it into the discs necessary to build the scale. Then we couldn't use the scale, which was really disappointing because it is central to the game. Also, my ten year old found an error in one of the question cards - the answer provided was incorrect. Having said all that, we still enjoy the game and play it alot even though we can't use the scale. It is very interesting, especially if your child has an inclination towards logic, mechanics, or physical sciences. My son loves it, and because he is mechanical minded (and I'm not!), he gets a kick out of getting answers right that Mom gets wrong
