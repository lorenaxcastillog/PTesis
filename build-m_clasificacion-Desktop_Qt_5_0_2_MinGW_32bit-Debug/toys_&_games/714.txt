 We bought this last Christmas (2004) for my son then 5. It was a huge hit. He loves the fact that he can take the motorcycles off and play with them by themselves. In my house, the platform hauls more than the motorcycles. He uses it to move anything that will on top around the house. Almost a year later it is still one of his favorite toys. It is very durable. It has been dropped, washed, run into walls and furniture and it still is in one piece. A great product and toy for the car/truck/motorcycle lover in your child
