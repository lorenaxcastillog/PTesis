 Please, do not waste your time on this product. It is the biggest waste of money. I bought it after using professional potter's wheel in the studio I worked at, and did not expect for this toy to compare to the wheel's at the studio, so I was suprised at the speed the wheel went at with nothing on it, and with 2lbs on it. But the very minute I put the slightest pressure on the wheel to attempt to center the clay, the wheel came to complete stop. I tried for another hour with less and less clay, and the result was always the same. This is a complete gimmick and not worth a moment of your time
