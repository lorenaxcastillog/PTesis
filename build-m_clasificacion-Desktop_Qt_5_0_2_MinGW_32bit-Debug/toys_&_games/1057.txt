 We had moderate success with the Color Wonder markers, and made the next logical leap to the paints. DON'T DO IT! First of all, your child will start out by digging their fingers all the way into the paint - it's just human nature - so the paints are used up very fast. They'll empty the little troughs within a half an hour. Secondly, these paints are almost messier than colored paints. These aren't the hard-until-you-wet-them kinds of paints you're used to. These are soft paints all the way through, with the consistancy of ChapStick, and just as greasy. After rubbing the paints all over the paper, the paper is left with a heavy, greasy, transparent feel - days later,the paper's still not dry. Weeks and months later, the paper is still too disgusting to pick up. Yuck! I agree with prior reviews which site a child's lack of creativity, etc., but I think it's okay to just be messy sometimes. Having said that, this is just TOO messy and yucky to deal with. Go get some water color pencils or better yet, stick with grade-school acrylics
