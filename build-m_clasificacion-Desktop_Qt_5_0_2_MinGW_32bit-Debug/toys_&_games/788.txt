 I actually found this at Marshall's for a lot cheaper and was glad since my child rarely wanted anything to do with it. I got it to help entertain him in the car ~11 months but it only frustrated him with the poor attchment sites. He kicked it off quickly. At home, as he has gotten older, he occasionally picks up the phone to "talk" on it but since there are few noises, he got bored quickly. He's almost two and it just kept collecting dog hair and dust on it. I tried attaching it in his crib which secured better but he ripped it off too. Overall I would not recommend it for the car and most kids probably would get bored with it too. We'll see when my second arrives this year
