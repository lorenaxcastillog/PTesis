 This is a cute idea, but the materials used to make this is cheap. If it weren't for my daughter getting this for her birthday from a friend, I wouldn't of spent the money on it myself. It's cheaply made and falls apart easily. The ropes that hold the swings on, broke off within one day. My daughter loves this toy, and has gotten other sets to go with it. She plays with it often, but isn't made well. The babies are homely, and so tiny they are hard to dress. She loves it all the same. She is six and her sister is ten, and they play with it all the time. I am hoping that this toy continues to grow with new sets coming out, but I also hope that the assessories are made better than this item
