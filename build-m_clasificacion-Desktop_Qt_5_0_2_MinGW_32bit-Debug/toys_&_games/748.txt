 I usually hate games like this such as Settlers, Risk, etc. But this game was absolutely wonderful! My friends and I had an amazing time playing this game. It was so much fun. The game has a little something for everyone. The set-up is very cool, cloth gameboard, nice and sturdy game pieces. You also learn sweet pirate facts in the Lore and More on the cards. It is easy to understand and play, not too complicated. It is fun, because there is a lot of chance (dice determines a lot) and you can go from having no money to dominating the board. Very fun, I would recommend it to anyone.
