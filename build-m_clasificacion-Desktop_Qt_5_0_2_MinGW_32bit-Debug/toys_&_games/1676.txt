 Well, what can i say apart from...she's brilliant! I'm gonna talk you through the Pros and Cons of this doll! Pros 1. She has glitter lipstick and glitter eyeshadow 2. The detial with her clothes, and face paint is amazing! 3. She has the best clothes ever! 4. She has highlighted hair, that is brown and blonde. 5. She comes with tons of extras, and two great songs on a CD. 6.I love her stand, guitar and microphone. 7. You can play with her alone for ages...and she's still fun! Cons: 1. Some people might think she looks a bit gothic... 2. Some of the extras are a bit cheap and snap easily. 3. Sometimes, she pops out of her stand. Well, thats about it, but i really love this doll. She's great, and my favourite (out of 8) Cloe dolls. ~~~Gemma~~
