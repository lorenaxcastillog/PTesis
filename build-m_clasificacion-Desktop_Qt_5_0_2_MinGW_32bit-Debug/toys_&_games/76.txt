 First of all, please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off. This thing is a foot cube, so there's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it. That being said, when the cube first showed up, it seemed ok outside of the size, and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it. That is, until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the Elmo block to move at all. Shoddy at best. We've had this cube for a total of 3 days now, and already at least 4 stickers are off of it, due to not being placed center on the piece they were on, or just low-quality stickers. My children still play with the cube, as currently it provides no real safety hazard, but the price I paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality.
