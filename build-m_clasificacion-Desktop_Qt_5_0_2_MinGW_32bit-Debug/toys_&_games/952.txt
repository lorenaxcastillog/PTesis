 We bought these chairs to go with the Little Tikes Mission Design wood table. Not only are they are perfect match (they are, after all, from the same collection), but they are sturdy, well made and beautiful. The light natural wood coloring coordinates well with our furniture and this table and chair set can be used anywhere in the house without fear of staining the table or chairs. There is a light coating of finish that is virtually impenetrable and allows for easy clean up. My nearly 3 year old daughter, who is 38 inches tall, has no trouble fitting under the table in these chairs. She loves this set and so do I! It was super easy to assemble (I did it myself in less than 30 minutes). The chairs are sturdy and durable, yet light enough for my daughter to be able to move them with ease. I would buy these again in a heartbeat and would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a great table and chairs set!
