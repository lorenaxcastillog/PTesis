 We bought this tunnel over a year ago for our then-crawling almost-one-year-old. I figured it would encourage her to crawl more, which it did--she loved it! Now she's a running, screaming, jumping, independent 2 yo who still drags this tunnel out of the back corner of the play area (where I've tried to hide it) and squeals excitedly when we pop it out for her to play in. Her older sister, who is now 3 1/2, also loves the tunnel. She copies her aunt's ideas and stands upright in the tunnel to pretend she's a monster, or hops with it around her and pretends to be a caterpillar or a frog. We don't yet have any of the tent accessories, but we build our own tents with sofa cushions and sheets, then stick one end of the tunnel in a gap, and you have a secret entrance to a special hideaway. This is one of those classic toys that children of all ages can find lots of uses for--it sparks creativity and imagination, and gives Mom a few minutes' break to go clean the kitchen. ;-)
