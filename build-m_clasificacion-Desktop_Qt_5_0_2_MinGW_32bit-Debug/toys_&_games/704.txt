 My three and seven year old daughters have been playing with this toy for over an hour now. The three hair pieces that came with our set slide right onto the head with ease (we do not have the problem that the last reviewer had). I do, however, have to help set the little figure back on the base after the play doh is filled in; if it is not set in properly the play doh will not come out correctly. I am happy with this purchase, especially since the set currently comes with a free set of multi-colored play doh.
