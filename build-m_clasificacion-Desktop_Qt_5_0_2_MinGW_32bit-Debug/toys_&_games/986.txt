 I got this for my 6 year old nephew who was adopted from Africa. He is learning English and this is a really sweet story that happens to resonate with him particularly. He is often shy and tentative in his almost all white school and with shaky English skills. This story about a clumsy Giraffe that finds his own music to dance to is so inspiring and hopeful. My feminist sister says it would be good for any kid that feels a little bit different, and for 'normal' kids to look for 'different' kids' special talents. I like the animation which is really good, especially for a children's product. It was a crowd pleasure for everyone and it's broken into managable segments so you can play for as little as 10 minutes or as much as 2 hours. There is a fun play along dance game that brought all of us to our feet after Thanksgiving dinner. We danced for over half an hour kids and adults
