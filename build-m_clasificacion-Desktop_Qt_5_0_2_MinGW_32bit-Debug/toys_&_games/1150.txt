 I'm searching the web trying to figure out how to get blue moonsand color out of my carpet. My kids like it and it is pretty cool, but whatever you do, don't let your kids play with it over carpet. I figured I could just vacuum it up, but if the kids have stepped in it and smushed it into the carpet, good luck! I'm upset right now, because I've spent 1/2 an hour with my carpet cleaner trying to get the blue out of my light tan carpet. That's the only complaint I have. Only play with this stuff outside and be careful not to track it into the house.
