 We bought this train for our 4 year old son for Christmas. We were worried about it being too old for him, but he wanted a 'Polar Express train' so badly. We tried it and it is perfect! We are so pleased with this train. The quality is incredible. The lights come on when the train runs. We run it on the carpet because it comes with the track raised on its own plastic platform (we were worried about having to build something up to run it ont he carpet). The whistle you can make it do sounds like a real train- although softer :). The people it comes with are realistic and have holes on their feet for putting on top of the train or in the back of the cars- our son loves to play with it. We couldn't have asked for better. Although a little expensive- well worth the money. Lionel got this one on the mark!!
