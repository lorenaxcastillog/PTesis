 Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ... I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it. You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website. The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto). The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion. Hope that helps someone
