 My family and I all love board games and bought this after reading the great reviews. It lived up to all expectations. My husband read the instructions and easily explained the game to us. Strategies are quickly realized but are varied. The game is different every time and can be played in under an hour. This game comes with the free "river" expansion pack so you can play with or without. I like with the river better. The game is most fun with two players, but we've played with up to four and still had a good time. Strategy changes with more people
