 I love Suzie. she is the best doll i've ever had!! Suzie comes with loads of acssesories! I use them every day! When I change her diaper i feel like a real mom!! she needs lots of care and love. I can tell her my deepest darkest secrets and she doesn't tell anyone,not even my best friend!! Suzie talks to me and she plays the funnest games with me! I bring her to my best friends house and she plays with Suzie as much as she can, my friend wants her really bad! when she drinks her bottle she makes cute noises! as long as you don't press her buttons she is absoulutly perfect! I think everyone should get her! I LOVE Suzie, she is a part of my family!
