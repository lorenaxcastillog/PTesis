 What little boy or girl doesn't love trains? I have a 5 year old girl and a 1 year old boy and every time we go to one of those stores with a train set like this one out for the kids to try I always have a hard time dragging my kids away. Well, now my kids can play with a train set as long as they want! This set comes with the perfect amount of trains, cars, and track for several kids to play at once and keep one kid entertained for hours. My kids are also fond of Thomas the Train whose vehicles are fully compatible. The table is very sturdy while the 120 piece train set is also well made and you cannot beat the price which I would have been willing to spend just for the table alone. I would highly recommend this set to anyone whose kids like trains or have had to be pried away from an in store display
