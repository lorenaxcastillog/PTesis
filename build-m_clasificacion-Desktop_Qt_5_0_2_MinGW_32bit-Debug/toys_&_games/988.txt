 This is my 3 year old son's favorite toy. He needed help with it at first, but now he is able to do all four puzzles on his own. He puts the puzzles together over and over again each day. The size makes it a great toy to travel with. It is the perfect puzzle for a child who is ready to move on from the bigger wooden puzzles with the knobs. My only complaint is that the box should be slightly bigger. My son sometimes has trouble shutting the lid of the box when he puts all the pieces away. A bigger box would solve that problem
