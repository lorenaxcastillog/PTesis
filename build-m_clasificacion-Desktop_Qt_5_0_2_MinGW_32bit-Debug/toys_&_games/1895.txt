 This bear is awesome for 2-3 yr olds who are a bit afraid of the dark. I tell my daughter when Glo-E bear goes off, that means he is asleep & it is time for her to go to sleep. He lights up for 15 min's each time you touch his paw...& she gets sleepy waiting for him to go off. Also she knows she can light him up if she wakes in the night. He is very soft & furry. Only complaint is you can feel the mechanism inside that does the lighting up...wish they could of made that smaller but he's still pretty cuddly
