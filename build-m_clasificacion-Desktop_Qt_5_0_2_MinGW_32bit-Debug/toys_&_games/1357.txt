 I first saw this toy at a play group where my 10 month old son played with it for a bit. Once he got the idea of crawling through the tunnels he loved it. I came home and ordered a set for ourselves. Firstly, this is by far the best price for this set anywhere and secondly, we have sooooooo much fun with it. My son loves crawling through the tunnel and playing peek-a-boo. My husband and I will often play with him and we all have a great time. I am so glad I bought this set and would recommend it for new crawlers and up. The other good thing is that you don't need to set up all the pieces up to play with it. Right now we use only one tunnel most of the time and occasionally bring out another tunnel and the center piece. I can't wait to take it outside in the summer. As my son gets older we'll use more pieces so it can grow with him. No fancy bells and whistles, just plain old fun for everyone
