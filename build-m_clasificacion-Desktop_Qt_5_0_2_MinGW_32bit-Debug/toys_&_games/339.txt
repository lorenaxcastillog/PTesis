 My daughter got this for her 6th birthday. She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister. One of them is using it all the time. The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her. My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD. My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can. Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD. I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat
