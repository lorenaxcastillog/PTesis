 I purchased this machine for my eight year old neice who loved to used my full size sewing machine. The intent for giving her this machine was to give her a kid-sized machine designed for children that would allow her her to practice and learn how to sew in her own. She loved the design and colors of the machine. However, it was very difficult to thread the needle as the presser foot "protectors" were in the way. She could never thread it and required an adult. The bobbin kept binding up. I tried everything to get the machine to work, but all attempts failed. Overall for being a kids machine, it is the right size but the quality is only okay. In the end, I decided to get a smaller full-sized "real" machine for her to use, as it was more reliable
