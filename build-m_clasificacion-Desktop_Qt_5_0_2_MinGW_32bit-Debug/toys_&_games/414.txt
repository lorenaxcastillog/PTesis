 MY TWO YEAR OLD SON GOT THIS POOH BEAR FOR A &quot;BIRTH&quot; GIFT. HE BRINGS HIM EVERYWHERE. IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM. HE HAS TWO NOW, BUT LET ME TELL YOU HE CAN TELL THEM APART!!! THE TAG ON HIS &quot;FIRST&quot; ONE IS SLIGHTLY MORE WORN AFTER COUNTLESS WASHINGS AND HE LIKES THAT ONE BEST. THE &quot;OTHER ONE POOH BEAR&quot; AS HE CALLS IT, WORKS ONLY IN EMERGENCIES. MY 9 MO. OLD DAUGHTER IS GETTING THE PIGLET SINCE SHE LOVES THE POOH TOO BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF MY SON GIVING ONE UP. BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
