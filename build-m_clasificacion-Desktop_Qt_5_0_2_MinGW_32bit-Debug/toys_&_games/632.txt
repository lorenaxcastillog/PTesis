 Hey, I just wanted to write in a review for this game because I loved it so much. I just ordered it less than a week ago, and it is already here, no problems, with a great price for an unbelievable game. The game consists of 100 I've Never cards (10 which you make up on your own) and each one is more hilarious than the next. I played with a bunch of my college friends and was drunk before I even rolled the dice (the way we all want it to be). Looking for a great game to play and learn all the unspoken truth of your friends, then definately test out this game, I highly reccomend this
