 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas who is 3 and my 1 year old sits in the passenger seat. They absolutely love it. And unlike some of the other power wheels we have purchased (vw bug and the corvette) it is both durable and does not get stuck easily. Also, it can actually go uphill!! If your not letting them ride in a controlled area (such as a basketball court) it is best to ride a bike along side them since you have to run to keep up with this fast paced kiddy vehicle. Overall I would recommend this to anyone with a child over 3- 3 1/2. Younger children should sit in the passenger seat and only if they have good head control (personally I would say over 1 year).
