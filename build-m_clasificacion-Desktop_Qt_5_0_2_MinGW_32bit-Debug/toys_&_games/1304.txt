 We were introduced to this game - big orange box, cards, and bell - when I was a kid. I hadn't seen it for years and then I found it at a drugstore. I heard my family talking about it, gave the pack of cards I bought to my mom, and since then it's a huge hit during the holidays and when the family gets together. I was just home for Christmas and we had loads of fun. It can get really noisey. I always recommend the version with the bell because otherwise it's not as clear cut a start and finish, although you can decide an opening and closing anouncement. Very easy to play and introduce others to, and I didn't even realize until recently that it was meant to teach kids about the stock market. Fascinating! If you love to play games, this is a must have for your game cupboard
