 My son will be two in one week and he loves this! He is always picking up toys in the store and then getting tired of them before we get to the check out or before we get to the house with them once they are out of the package. He has a blast with this, telling me the colors of the balloons and shapes. He also uses the shapes to count out when he makes a new one on the screen. It's easy for him to use and erase. Excellent travel toy too! I highly recommend this for any toddler that's not easy to occupy in a restaurant or anywhere for that matter
