 My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment. This "game" is really hard to call a game. It's more like one long reading exercise. Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again. Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to "unlock" the game. Then in order to play the "game" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the "game" and then try to explain it to my son. I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware
