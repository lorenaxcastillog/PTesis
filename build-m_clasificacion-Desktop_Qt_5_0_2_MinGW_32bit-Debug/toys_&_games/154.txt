 This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's. A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing. The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship. These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies. However, the kit is worth the price. My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith". The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long. In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long. Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale.
