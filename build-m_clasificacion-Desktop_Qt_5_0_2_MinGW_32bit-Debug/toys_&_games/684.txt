 We bought this at the Thomas visiting train event for $6.95. I like the colorforms over regular stickers, as they are much more durable in the hands of my 2yo. My 3yo is thrilled that so many trains were included in the set. However, for the 1-inch thick box, all you get for sticking these on is the picture on the cover. Once all the tracks were occupied, my son started started sending the trains to the Great Scrap Heap In The Sky. Either that, or they sprouted invisible wings. For this to be a truly good product, the background should have been 1) oriented the other way, and 2) should have had at least three other backgrounds - the docks, Tidmouth Sheds, or some other locations. Once again, I am disappointed by the Thomas merchandising machine
