 My four year old received this seat as a Christmas gift and she just loves it. She uses it for her new Cabbage Patch baby. It is the perfect size. It is lightweight and the handle makes it very easy to carry. I love it because it does not have any batteries or accessories that would break and need replacing. The little animals embroidered on the fabric are adorable. It is very well made and looks very similar to a real infant carrier. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a doll carrier. It is a much better alternative to the high priced American girl items
