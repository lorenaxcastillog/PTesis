 I loved this trike! It was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it. Daycare was in walking distance (I lived in the city) and I used the trike to take him. My son loved to hold onto the handle bars, it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated. My son is now three years old and I am buying a new one for my one year old. I understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy. The brand Radio Flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects. This is the only gift that was given to my son that I can say "I LOVE" and have had for more than just one year! Enjoy
