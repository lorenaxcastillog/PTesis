 I bought this puzzle for my son a few months ago and left it in the closet for a while, I thought that at 4 1/2 he might be a bit young for it. I brought it out a few weeks ago and was thrilled! My son absolutely loves it and begs to play with it! He does not have any problem with the fact that it is not a jigsaw puzzle. In fact, this puzzle for the most part divides pieces on state lines and is a great tool for learning geography. My son likes to find Florida where his grandma lives. We often discuss people we know who live in other states as well. We love this puzzle and recommend for the over 4 crowd, although my 2 year old daughter can't wait to get her hands on it too
