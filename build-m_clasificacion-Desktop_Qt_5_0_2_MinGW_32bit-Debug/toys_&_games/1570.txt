 When I bought this product, I didn't know if we'd use it alot. Well, I was wrong. Forget the stroller on casual walks in the neighborhood or on the boardwalk! Kids love riding this wagon and the ease of use really helps! Its very easy to assemble, the item is lightweight, and the steering is easy. I love the safety belts to keep them safe. The wheels are easy to maneuver as well. There's even a spot for me to put my soda or coffee! How nice! A definite buy! I wish they'd make a bigger one to hold 3 childen
