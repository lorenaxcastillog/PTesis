 Our 2 and 4 year old boys love this tower. It chimes when trains pass under it (there's a light sensor that points down onto the track). My 2 year old especially loves that he can rotate the picture wheel and it plays songs. This has held up remarkably well since we got it at Christmas. Many little hands have pushed the top button and turned the picture wheel. It has also been dropped and knocked over about a million times (boys!). Our windmill broke within a few minutes of rough boy play and the crane didn't hold their interest. It's the chime clock tower and the saw mill that are constantly played with
