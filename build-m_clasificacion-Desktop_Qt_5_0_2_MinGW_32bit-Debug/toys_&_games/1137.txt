 I ORDERED THIS FIGURE THINKING HE WOULD BE ABOUT AS TALL AS A BARBIE DOLL. WRONG!!!! HE IS MUCH LARGER!!!!! HE IS ALMOST HUGE! MUCH BIGGER THAN I WOULD EXPECT FOR A TEN DOLLAR TOY! THIS PRICE RIGHT HERE (OF ONLY TEN DOLLARS) REALLY IS A BARGAIN! WHAT'S MORE THIS DOLL LOOKS VERY NICELY MADE. HE LOOKS BOTH DURABLE AND ATTRACTIVE. I BOUGHT THIS FIRST ONE FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO I HAVEN'T OPENED THE PACKAGE. BUT I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THE TOY'S APPEARANCE THAT I AM ORDERING ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF! IF HE PERFORMS HALF AS WELL AS HE LOOKS HE WILL HE WILL BE WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY. AND I USUALLY DON'T BUY "BOY" TOYS. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS BATMAN ROCKS! 5 VERY, VERY BIG STARS! AND A NEW BATMAN FAN HERE
