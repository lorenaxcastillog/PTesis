 I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original. I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on
