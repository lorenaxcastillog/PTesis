 We received this game as a gift and I was not very happy about it as we try to limit focus on vanity with our young daughters. Having said that, the game gets a lot of playing time. The box says ages 5 and up, however much younger children can play, bottoming out at 3 because of choking hazared sized pieces. We change the rules so that you can choose which direction to go so that the game is a bit more than a random spinner game. (adds a tiny bit of strategy) The kids off and on refuse to wear the earrings because they are the pinch type (of course) and then just lay them in front of them. We used sharpies to color in the numbers on the spinner because they were hard to see as they are gray on gray
