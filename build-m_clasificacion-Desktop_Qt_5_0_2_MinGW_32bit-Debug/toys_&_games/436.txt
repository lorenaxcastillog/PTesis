 This doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it???? It's life, nothing's perfect, GET OVER IT! You can't expect perfection...as long as the item itself isn't damaged there's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard box it comes in! This is a nice doll (even if the box is dented) and I would recommend purchasing it. I ordered this doll and the box mine came in was in good shape (to me anyway). As far as I know, buyers on ebay aren't extremely picky on the condition of the box...they are more concerned on the condition of the doll and whether or not it is still in the box.
