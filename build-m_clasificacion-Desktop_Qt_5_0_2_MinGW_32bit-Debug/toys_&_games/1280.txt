 If you're like my friends and me and spent your teens and early 20's in the 90's, you'll LOVE this game. Great questions dealing with music, movies, tv, events, and sports. The great thing is that most of the questions really make you think a bit (it's not a super-easy no-brainer like some of the other games out there). We set up 3 teams of 2 and the game took about an hour, hour and a half (obviously, more teams = longer playing time). This game will definitely be a staple in all of our gaming nights. A sure bet
