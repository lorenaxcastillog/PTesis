 Oh My Gosh, these Thomas games are great. I don't know who thought them up but they are wonderful teaching aids. They take many of the common educational games and rework them using Thomas and his Friends. With this game you get 4 playing boards (they call these `lotto style' boards for reasons unclear to me-but their just playing boards LOL) and 36 character cards. With these preschoolers and kindergartners can play matching and memory and `what's missing' games. Five Stars. Trainloads of fun and we have found that it is an excellent way to teach our little guy to take turns and practice memory skills. (He's 3.5 at present.) [This will be the second Thomas game we purchased. The first was the Thomas 'Number Game'. Great for math. I recommend you check it out.
