 When the Toa and all the first Bionicles came out, it was very simple and straigthforward. Bad guys were different from the Toa and everyone knew they were bad. Now, with the Pirahka, we have villians claiming to be Toa! And the matoran believe them! One of the things I really love about Zaktan is his weapon. It looks really cool and can change. Also, the little ball launcher (I forget what it's called) is a lot of fun (I shot my brother with it X3) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome! Though the rubber part is sligthy annoying, it doesn't really get in the way
