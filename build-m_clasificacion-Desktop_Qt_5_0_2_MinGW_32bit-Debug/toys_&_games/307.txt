 My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school. I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"
