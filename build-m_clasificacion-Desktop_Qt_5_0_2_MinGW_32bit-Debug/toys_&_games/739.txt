 This happens to be one of my favorite toys (I collect toys). It is so cute it's outragous-whenever I see it, I can't help but smile. I keep Darth Tater up on top of my left audio speaker tower, and he's one of the first things you see when entering my living room. This is a great toy concept, and for those of us who have never forgotten our potato head days, this will bring them back with a smile. Very easy to put together, but I would NOT buy it for a small child, as there are some smallish plastic parts that they might swallow=very definitely a toy for us scifi/emorabilia lovers. Honey, I remember when the first Tater Heads came out, you had to stick the plastic parts into a REAL potato! So this all-plastic version is a VERY pleasant update. This would make a great office toy......I give this five smilies up!!! :-
