 I feel like an idiot, maybe I didn't have all the parts or something but I tried and my husband tried and my neice tried and my friend tried and my stepson tried and NONE of us could figure out how to get this thing together. Since there were no instructions, that helped alot. There was a picture but the hoops that went over secured to nothing and fell on the kid, making it utterly useless. Though there were little things that appeared to attach to something, they taunted us and we tried and tried to attach this here and that there and maybe that will work...it was ridiculous. We haven't had the issue with any other baby thing...not car seats, not the red wagon, not the baby gates, not the crib or the cradle...but this thing after several attempts we just took the hangdowns off and she played with those until the batteries died. We sold it at a garage sale for a buck and felt like glad for it to be out of our lives and out of our closet
