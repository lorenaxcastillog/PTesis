 Product is average... On ours the button whole is sewed so tight even I have problems buttoning... impossible for my 20 month old. It says clothes remove fully and easily... which I thought would be great for my daughter since she likes to try and dress things... but the pullover has to be removed by pulling over the head and it isn't easy... and again is almost impossible for a little one. Also... ours didn't come with a back pack which I'm sure would have made the toy more fun! Perhaps she'll gain interest and capability with the toy in months to come... but right now... she has about as much interest in it as she does in say... carpet
