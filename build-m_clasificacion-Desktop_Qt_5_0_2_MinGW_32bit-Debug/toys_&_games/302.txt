 I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas. It was a nice present, he enjoys it. 2 things though, it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is. It could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max, and that is two 2-3 year olds. It is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in Big Bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money, especially since i didn't pay for shipping
