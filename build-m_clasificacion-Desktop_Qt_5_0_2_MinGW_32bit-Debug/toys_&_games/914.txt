 It's hard to find games that 16 to 18 year olds will play. Pig Pile has become a household favorite. One of my daughter's boyfriends won't play any other games with us unless we start with his favorite, Pig Pile. I plan on buying one for him to take when he goes to college in the fall. Though the pigs are only used for scoring, they provide entertainment by playing with poses while waiting your turn. The description of play has already been explained by others so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say, it's great for all ages
