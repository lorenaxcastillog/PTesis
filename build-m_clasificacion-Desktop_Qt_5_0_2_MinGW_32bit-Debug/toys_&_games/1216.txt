 Sequence is a great family card game, it is easy to learn and we do not get "bored". There are no math problems to be concerned about. It something you can take when you travel. We played sequence at our local pool and quite a few people watched us and inquired what kind of game is was and where to purchase it. Of course I told them to go on Amazon.com. It is affordable as it comes in various sizes from a small board to a jumbo board. We play squence with our Grandchildren and also our mature friends also love the game. Thank you.
