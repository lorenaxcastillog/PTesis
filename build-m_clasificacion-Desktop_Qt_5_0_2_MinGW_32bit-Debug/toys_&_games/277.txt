 We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one. We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside. It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric. We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there. We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us. Highly recommend!
