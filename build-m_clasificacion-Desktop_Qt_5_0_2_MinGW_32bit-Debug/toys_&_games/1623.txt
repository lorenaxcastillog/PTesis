 This wagon is almost as big as the Original Radio Flyer, and except for the plastic wheels, just as sturdy. I am 68 years old and have had back surgery. I bought this wagon to carry groceries and other bulky items to and from my car to my apartment. I even left the cardboard packing liner inside the cargo area to protect the finish. The wagon was easy to assemble with common household tools. The wheels are secured on the axles only by hammer-on plastic 'hubcaps', which was the only thing that disappointed me. However, there were several extra 'hubcaps' included, and since I don't plan to sit in the wagon myself, and push off down a hill, I expect that this good little wagon will last as long as I do. A great buy! I recommend it
