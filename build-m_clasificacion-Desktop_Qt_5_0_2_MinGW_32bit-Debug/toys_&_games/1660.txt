 Easy to set-up. Ants arrived within 3 weeks of ordering them. I set it up almost 2 months ago and the ants are still busy tunneling and working. No need to add food, water, or anything. Just dump the ants in and watch them work. I am using this with a group of middle school students as a lab observation. Came with a magnifying glass. The kids have really enjoyed it and even named some of the ants. The gel medium really allows you to see what's going on and the container can be passed around for observation without fear that it will disturb the ants tunnels. A definite hit for curious children of all ages. I will do this again next year
