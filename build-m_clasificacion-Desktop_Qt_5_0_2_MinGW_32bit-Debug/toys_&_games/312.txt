 I can't put it any better than the others before me have. I did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more money for a TON more quality. This is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35). The other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set. The prices vary wildly. Yes, it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there. However, the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk. You simply can't do better than this set
