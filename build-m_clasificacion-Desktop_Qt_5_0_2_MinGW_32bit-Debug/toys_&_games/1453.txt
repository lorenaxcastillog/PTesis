 Just got this one for my 3 year old little girl, she kept asking for one. We let her choose her own helmet and knee pads set (just in case). She sat on it and put her foot on the pedal and off she went(unfortunately without me telling her to get her foot of the pedal to stop) it was in the foyer so no harm done, she just slam in to the wall. she was a bit scared after that but I explained to her that is stears where she wants it to go and if she wants to stop she just has to take her foot off the pedal. She really likes it now. The lesson is when you introduce a new toy make sure the child knows how to use it and what to expect before letting her sit and try it out. The price is pretty fair, we have other step 2 toys and I think they are made to last
