 I am a big fan of the Letter Factory DVDs so when I saw this game, I was very excited. It did not disappoint! It is a great game because you can play with just one person. So, you can have your child play it alone for fun learning or with you or with siblings/friends. It has two different levels so the game grows with your child. My only complaint is that the cards get messy on the board. They should have put little slots or something to hold them in place on each letter. If your child needs a fun way to learn colors, letters, sounds, and counting ...this is the game for you! (I recommend having them watch the DVD of Letter Factory Letters and/or Words before playing - same characters).
