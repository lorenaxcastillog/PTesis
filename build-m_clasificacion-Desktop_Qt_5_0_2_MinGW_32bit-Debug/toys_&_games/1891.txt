 Got this for my 11 & 13 yr old daughters that like the show. We also got the DVD version of the game. The handheld version is actually more fun then the DVD game because selecting the cases is painfully slow in the DVD game. The display is a little hard to see if it's not bright in the room, but it's simple fun. The game shuts itself off if you put it down and don't turn it off. The only delay is when it calculates the bankers offer after each round, but otherwise it moves along at a good pace. A good game for some mindless fun you can take anywhere with you
