 Me and my husband bought this for our 2 year old son for christmas. and after reading the reviews on this website, i had told him that it would more than likely be hard to put together. so he wasnt looking forward to that on christmas eve. but when he opened the box to put it together, he said the instructions were perfectly clear to him. he didnt have a problem putting it together at all. our son loved it. and it is big enough to where he will get plently of use out of it as he grows. my husband said that the seat also adjusts for the kids. i havent seen anything about this on amazon, so maybe we got an updated version. i dont know. but my son loves it!
