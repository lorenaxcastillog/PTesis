 My 2-year-old has spent at least 45-60 minutes a day playing with this, from ages 23-28 months. Got it as a Christmas gift when he was 15 months, but he was too young then, so we put it away. Once he started playing with it, we quickly bought (or suggested as a 2-year b-day gift) the Percy, Toby and James sets. OMG, he LOVES it, I would've paid three times what it cost if I could've ever predicted how much time he spends with it. Practically, we could throw out the rest of his toys and he wouldn't notice. With all the sets we have now, there is enough track...but more would be nice, too
