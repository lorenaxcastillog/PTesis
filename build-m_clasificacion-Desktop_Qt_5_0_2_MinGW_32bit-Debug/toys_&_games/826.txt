 We bought this book for our daughter because she loves all the characters associated with Winnie the Pooh. We quickly discovered what others have noted, namely, it is rather slow-paced when compared to My First LeapPad's other books. The songs are slower, as is the story, and the activities are much more laid-back. So while it doesn't hold our daughter's attention for long at normal times, we found it good for slowing down the pace on rainy days or just before bedtime. Which she has not learned as much from this book as from the others, the slower pace seems to have a calming effect on her, which as any parent of a four year-old will attest, can be a blessing
