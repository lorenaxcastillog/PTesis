 My twin boys (16 months) love this toy. I would suggest getting at least 100 extra balls. (I have 250 in our ball pit and it really looks fun)) The connections aren't the best, but they work better than other company models that don't have velcro straps. Our kids play in this on and off most of the day. On a cautionary note, this is a fairly large system of tunnels and tents so make sure that you have plenty of room. Of course, you can use the pieces separately to make several smaller play spaces instead of one large area. Overall, I am glad I purchased this and that I didn't wait until the recommended 3 year old age range.
