 My husband got this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, and while it's not perfect, we have had a lot of fun with it so far! Sure, it takes 10 minutes to heat up, but that's not a big deal. It doesn't make much at a time, but we just keep adding sugar every minute or so and it makes as much as we want! It might not be as fun for an older child, but for a toddler, she LOVES it! She can't eat it any faster than it comes out anyway...and it's a great reward for her! We used it today as her reward for taking a nap, and she was so thrilled
