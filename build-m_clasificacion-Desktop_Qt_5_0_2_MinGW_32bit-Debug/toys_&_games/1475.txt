 We bought this for our 1 year old and the first time she pushed it she got four steps when her hand slipped and the stroller rolled right out from under her. She fell on her hands, thankfully, and not her face but it scared her so much she didn't even want to look at it again! We were sold on it because we were told that it had some special design where it wouldn't do that, but it did. We are disappointed. I think if our daughter was bit older it might be better--I would suggest you wait to buy it until she is at least 2
