 I have a toddler who is VERY picky about toys, and I have been hard-pressed to find one that keeps his attention. He received this little tool set for Christmas and loves it. He is into more mechanically oriented toys, naturally, so it's up his alley. But the set is well-crafted and easy for him to use. The drill actually drills in screws and has interchangeable bits. Our little guy pretends he's Bob the Builder in the yellow hard-hat. I can't vouch for the longevity of this toy, since we've only had it a month or so, but it's a neat little tool-set and has held up to a lot of abuse so far
