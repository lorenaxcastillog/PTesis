 My son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday. It was easy to put together and I was impressed with the attention to detail on this toy. The doors and decals mainly. There are several small parts that can easily be put in a plastic bag and put away. It has been over a year and this airplane still "flies" around our house. My son loves it. The only reason that this review is not carrying 4 stars is due to a minor annoyance. The tail section and the wheels seem to always be coming off. They are easily snapped back on but it is irritating to be fixing the bloody thing every 5 minutes. As my son has gotten older I have taught him how to fix it himself. I guess the key thing here is that the toy can be fixed. I would rather snap the thing back together than deal with a truly broken toy
