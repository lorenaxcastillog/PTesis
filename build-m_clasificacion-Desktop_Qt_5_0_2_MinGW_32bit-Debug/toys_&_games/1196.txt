 Honestly, I found these plates a LOT cheaper in my local meijer's store, plus they were on sale to boot. That said, you really can't do without these baseplates if your child is going to build anything with legos. It's a bunch of fun anyway, seeing how high you can make towers, which is impossible to do without one of these. They should include these in the sets and how about different colors too? Gray and green get a little boring. You really can't use those colors when you're pretending to be out in the desert with your big army tanks, now can you? Sure wish I could find one of those big legos tables - if anyone sees one, please let me know. They would be an even better investment over these baseplates
