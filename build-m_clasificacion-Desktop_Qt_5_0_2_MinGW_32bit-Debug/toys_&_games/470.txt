 We have had this toy with both our daughters. My 3yr old still enjoys playing with it, but because it is so low to the ground my baby (almost a year) is the one that really loves it. My first daughter loved it just as much when she was about that age also. We like the shapes and the basic pots and open and closing of the doors and such. It is difficult to put things in the fridge and have them stay, but that isn't such a big deal because they play in all the other compartments. By the time my oldest was two she was ready for a bigger kitchen, but it is great entertainment for the younger!
