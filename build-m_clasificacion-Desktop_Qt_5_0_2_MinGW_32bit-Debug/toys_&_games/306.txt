 Our family loves this game. It brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play. There are 5 catigories. Movies, weird laws, initials, word meaning, dealers choice. Everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers. Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct. We played many times over Christmas with teenagers and gramdma too! Everyone was having such a great time we didn't want the game to be over. Turn off the TV, make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun, no pressure to win game
