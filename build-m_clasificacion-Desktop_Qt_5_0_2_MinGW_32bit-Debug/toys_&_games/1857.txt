 this version added quite a few dimensions to a game that we in our house have been playing non-stop for over a year now. While the original monopoly is a staple, and we all know its subtilties (sp?), this game had all the flavors of the original and added a lot to the game. I dare say we might be playing a lot more of it in upcoming months. Highly recommended, however we have adjusted the rules a bit; the game seems to unfairly make the boardwalk property (usually not a great property) the single most important property. Look at the discussion section of this listing for rule changes that we have come up with to fix this problem. I'd like other opinions. - JL
