 My 3 year old absolutely LOVES making this puzzle, with my help. I give her about 5 pieces at a time, and she sings the song, and gets the right pieces... every time we make it she gets better and better at being able to name the letters, and their sounds, and the pictures. Now she can almost make the puzzle by herself, and delights in doing so. The pieces are sturdy; the pictures are bright and engaging. I love it's size, because it makes the puzzle fun and there's no doubt as to which piece she's pointing to when she names a letter
