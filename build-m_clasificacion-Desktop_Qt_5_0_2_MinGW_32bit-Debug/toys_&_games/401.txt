 My three children are huge fans of Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly. Being an organization freak myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case. Not only did it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and look nice too. Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again! We purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore. You might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead. More for your money! In our case, we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have
