 I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months old. She is now 4. She and her younger sister still play with this often. I have a toy chest full of many toys. This is the only toy that I have purchased that has been used for so long and so often. It's great!! There are 3 types of blocks. Some that are fabric that are best for the 6-18 month age group. There are rubber like blocks that are best fro 9-24 months. Then there are the wooden blocks with lots of pictures. My kids still stack the blocks and view the pictures on the wooden blocks. My 4 year old loves to build stuff with the wooden blocks. The walker/cart was used as a walker and now is used as a stepping stool. I recently purchased this for my nephew who is 12 months old and he loves it. His parents doubted that there would be another toy he receives that will be used as much as this Block Walker. This is an A+++++ toy! If I could only buy one toy for my kids it would be this Around the Block Walker
