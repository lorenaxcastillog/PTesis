 Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old. He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure.
