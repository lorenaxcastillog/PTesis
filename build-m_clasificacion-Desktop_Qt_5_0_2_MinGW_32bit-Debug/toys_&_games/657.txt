 My husband and I bought this for our son for his second birthday and he LOVES it. We set it up as soon as he unwrapped it and he played with it for an hour straight, stopping only because it was bed time. He even passed up cake so he could continue playing. The ball is the perfect size and the height adjustment will be very useful as his skills improve. He can easily play by himself, as most shots that go through the hoop are returned to him. Warning: temper tantrum might ensue when it is time to stop playing
