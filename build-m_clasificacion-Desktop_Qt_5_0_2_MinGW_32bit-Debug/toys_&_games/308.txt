 Well the space is limated but I learned how to deal with it. The set comes with four parts rainforestchamber, bug chamber, aquarium , and ant colony. The aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. Finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since I bought this during winter I will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard. And we all know what you put in a bug chamber. Over all I rate this four stars due to small space. P.s there a bug catcher in it as well
