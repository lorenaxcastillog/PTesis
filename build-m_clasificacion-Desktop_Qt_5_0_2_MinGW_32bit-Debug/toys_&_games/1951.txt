 these seemed like such a good idea and my daughter and her best friend were actually willing to spend their own hard-earned money on them. So we bought them and I spent an hour or so assembling the two pairs. Within an hour we knew they had to go back. First and foremost, the girls were totally disappointed in what they did. Blame the box, it's deceptive, but I was willing to chalk that up to real world education and would have let my daughter deal with the lesson. More disturbing was that we had to replace a half dozen or more of the black rubber bands within that time, they snapped. Now I know why they give you so many, it's not just for the heaviest kids (who proabably are too old for the toy to begin with.) It's so every time the kids use them an adult can spend time putting new bands on...until you run out. Needless to say, they went back the same day.
