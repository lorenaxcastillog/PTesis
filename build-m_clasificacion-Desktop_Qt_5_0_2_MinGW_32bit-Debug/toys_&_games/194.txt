 I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use
