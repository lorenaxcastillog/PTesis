 I was at a family event last week and we were all trying to figure out what to do. The suggestion for a movie came up. One of my cousins fought the idea saying he didn't come all the way to visit so we could all sit together in the dark to watch a film. So we went to Walmart and bought some games. Taboo, Cranium, and Pictionary. Well, we had such a great time together. We really laughed and bonded. That weekend as we rode around one cousin pulled out a singing lesson Cd and played it in the car, Voice Lessons To Go by Vaccarino, so we all sang together in our car like crazies- again having the best time. The rest of the weekend, we played more games and never thought about turning on the TV or watching a film. My niece even played the piano for us one night and we sang songs from a song book. These games really help bring back the communication our generation has lost
