 This is another fun toy from Wild Planet's popular Spy Gear line of toys, the "Spy Voice Scrambler" works pretty good for it's size. Very small and light. It has a clip on the back to clip it to your belt or backpack. For age 6 and up, this toy helps the little spy in your house disguise his voice. Can be used on the couch or just for goofing around with each other. Changes both the speed and tone of your voice. It changes your voice to a baby sound, robot, or high-pitched chipmunk. Can be used to record, play, and twist voices and sounds. It is durable, we have had ours without problem for 1 year, and it has the original batteries. This device is also sold with a great belt and other spy gadgets in a kit called the "Micro Spy Kit", also at Amazon.
