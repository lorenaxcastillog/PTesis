 I just purchased this redesigned AT-ST from a local retail store. For the basic price of $20 for 244 pieces, this set is well worth the price. I purchased the original AT-ST years ago and this model far surpasses that one in all ways. It's larger, much more stable, and has a unique pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab. It was very difficult to get the original AT-ST to stand upright without falling over; the 7657 is extremely stable. The original AT-ST had Chewbacca at the controls which was pretty cool. However, not as cool as the AT-ST driver that has a new helmet and blaster. The only drawback is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional LEGO yellow. It took about 20 minutes to put the model together. It wasn't very challenging but interesting to see how the rotating mechanism was put together. I would highly recommend purchasing this set. For the low price of $20 for such a detailed and complete set, it's well worth the price. You won't be disappointed
