 This is a great toy. And with the new reduced price - it's a steal. This was a piece of cake to assemble - yes, I had to follow the directions, but I had it up and playing in about 45 minutes - and No, I am not very techno and handy. The lair has a lot of cool things, like a zip line, and an elevator with an escape hatch, a plunger shooter and a sofa the can tilt over to get rid of the bad guys. So much fun and very imaginative for young minds. I love it
