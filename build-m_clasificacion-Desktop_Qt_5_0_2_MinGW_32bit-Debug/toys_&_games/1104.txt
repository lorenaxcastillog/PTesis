 My daughter loves this toy! Once she was old enough to pull to a stand in her crib, we took her mobile out and put this in it's place to give her something to look at/play with. She loves to spin the wheel to play the music and she'll look at herself in the mirror and talk and giggle. It can keep her entertained in the morning for almost an hour (which means an extra hour that I can sleep in!). I usually leave it on the music setting, but sometimes I do turn it to the woman's voice as well. She's very creepy and weird, but my daughter seems to like both settings! It's a little scary when I hear, "Hellooo Baby!" at 5 am through the baby monitor!
