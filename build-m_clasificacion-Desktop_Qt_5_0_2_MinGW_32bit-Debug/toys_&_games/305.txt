 Our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday. She's a puzzle nut! This became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see. The picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean. The coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well. It is extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth. The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is the darker bottom pictures. Harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing.
