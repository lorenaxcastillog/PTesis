 I always had sea monkeys as a kid, so when I saw them in the store, I could not resist picking some up for my animal-crazy 4 year old. I had forgotten the 36 hours you have to wait, and since my son does not have a whole lot of patience- it was not an immediate hit. However these little creatures quickly grew, and now Im almost more amused by these little shrimp then my children. (and yes I know they are just Brine shrimp, Thank You) It was still a great science project for a four year old and his mom, and it added a nice dose of nostalgia to my day.
