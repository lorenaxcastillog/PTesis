 This has to be the best toy we ever bought for our 3 year old. He plays non-stop with this both outdoors and in our basement. I was worried it might go through alot of batteries but that hasnt been the case. He has learned to hit so well that I'm a little scared he won't find T-ball very stimulating. Adults have alot of fun with this too! If we had paid 4 times what it cost I would still say it was worth every penny! This one wont get left behind in the huge pile of unused toys.Definitely a great toy thats easy on the pocketbook
