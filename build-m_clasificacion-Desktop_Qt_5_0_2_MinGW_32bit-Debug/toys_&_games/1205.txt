 Much needed with our RC car. We purchased a RC car and were unable to find the battery pack at the store. As a result we had to purchase normal AA's while we searched out the battery pack. After 2 days of having to replace the batteries 3 times we told our son to wait till this came. It was great once it got in the car. Like others have said the car worked much better. It was faster, more powerful, and a lot more fun for my husband and son. It lasted about an hour and then just died when it lost power. An excellent product.
