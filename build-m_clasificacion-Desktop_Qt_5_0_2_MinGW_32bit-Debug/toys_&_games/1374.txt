 this item is great i got this about two months ago and it still works just fine i have been making movies with my friends for awhile now and we always have lightsaber fights and we hit as hard as we can and both of my friends that i make movies with have the others and they both as well work just fine and they've had them for longer but the only problem is that the waving sound is a little sensitive and even is who needs the batteries any way it shoots up by is self thats good enough for me.
