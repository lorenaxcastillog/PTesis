 ThinkFun succeeds once again, with a simple idea... lay down logs to find a path from start to finish across the river. Place your logs carefully, and you'll get where you need to go, but don't get in your own way, and you can't jump over the water. 40 challanges included (plus 40 more in River Crossing 2!), that will keep even adults busy for quite a while. Highly recommended for those visual / spatial gifted kids, and thier parents ;-) Stores in it's own nylon bag, a plus, since there are more than a few loose pieces.
