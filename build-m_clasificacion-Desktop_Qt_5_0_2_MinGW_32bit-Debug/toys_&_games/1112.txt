 This is one of the more unique Lego products you will find. And an excellent deal for a collection of hard to find Technic parts. If you are not familiar with Lego Technic, it incorporates the use of gears, axles, shafts and many other unique pieces into your typical Lego construction. The result - you can make your lego creations come to life and function like real world inventions. What a great way to teach your kids engineering, robotics, etc. This set has detailed instructions for two creations - the excavator and a bull dozer. Both actually function by turning a few knobs here and there. It took my six year old a couple of days to build, with only a little help needed from Dad. The only drawback is that the pieces are ALL Technic, so it is difficult to interface them to standard lego sets, so other than following the two instructions, my son has not figured out what else to make with the pieces. If nothing else, you acquire a lot of rare pieces that can help expand your existing set with many new possibilities. I especially like the worm gears and turret assembly
