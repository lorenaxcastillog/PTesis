 This toy is frustrating to my 1 yr old son and his friends for two reasons: the first is that when he pushes on the back of the handle, the front comes up and pops him in the mouth (since he is crawling very near or directly above the truck). The second frustration is that the handle makes it hard to actually get anything in or out of the back of the truck, since he has pudgy little hands. Blocks fit into the hole in the end, but it's harder to get them out. I would recommend the Hasbro squishy trucks instead for littler toddlers. Softer and safer
