 I love ZOOB toys for so many reasons. My sons play quietly for long periods of time, happily being creative and building the most amazing things. We give sets as gifts as often as possible and I am always surprised at how many people are not familiar with the line. The pieces (there are 5 different shapes which are different colors so that one can keep them straight) connect 20 diiferent ways and give you endless possibilities for building fun. It also allows you to make moveable creations (unlike many other building sets). The pieces are very durable. My 180 lb husband has stepped on a few and they survived without a crack. Last Year Santa brought a large ZOOB set and during the year my son remarked on how he wished there were wheels so he could design vehicles. Then we found this set- perfect! It does not disappoint:)
