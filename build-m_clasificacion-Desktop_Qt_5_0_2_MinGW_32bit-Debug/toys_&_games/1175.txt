 I purchased the Melissa and Doug folding stable for my daughter on her 8th birthday although I had reservations because the age range for it says 3-8. I was concerned she would grow out of it too fast even though she had insisted she wanted a stable for her set of horses. I needn't have worried; she absolutely adores it and plays with it a lot. Even if she loses interest in a year or two it is such high quality workmanship and such beautiful wood that I consider it a collector's item and to be kept for future generations. For anyone with a horse lover in the family this is the stable to get. Even the fencing that comes with it is exquisitely made!
