 I purchased this Car for My 4 year old son. When the car is shaken it makes real engine reving sounds, it allows enough time for little children to put the car down on the floor before it takes off. It can go very far. It works much better on a hard surface than on the carpet. We created some ramps out of cardboard for the car to jump, it actually gets up enough speed to jump the ramps. This is a fun car. I would say the only draw back is that little kids won't shake the car long enough for it to go very far. When my Husband and I shake it we can get the car to go a great distance further than our kids.
