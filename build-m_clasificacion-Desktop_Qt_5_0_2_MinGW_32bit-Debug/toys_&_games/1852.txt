 If you are looking for a good John Deere toy tractor, this is not it. If you are looking for a nice green toy tractor, this may do. The stickers on this model will peel off on their own within an hour of adhering them to the tractor. Manufacturer says to ship back to place purchased and ask for refund, but no parts are available even if you have missing parts. I have spoken with others that own the same toy and same thing happened to their stickers too. So if you buy it, don't waste your time placing the stickers on it
