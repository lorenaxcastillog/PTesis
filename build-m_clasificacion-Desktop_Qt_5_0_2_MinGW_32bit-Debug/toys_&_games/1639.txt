 Very helpful information was given from previous ratings that still sold me on this sandbox for my 4 y/o daughter. I liked the warning about the umbrella hole which I will know to watch out for. And I only bought 3 bags of sand for it which I put 2 in and am leaving 1 for back-up but it is still bigger than I even imagined which is great for the price! I took advantage of the SUPER SAVER FREE SHIPPING and I thought I wouldnt get the product for a month, 5 business days!! That was absolutely beyond anything I dreamed! My husband and I bought 2 big items from Amazon and had 2 great experiences, and I am a hooked customer! THANK YO
