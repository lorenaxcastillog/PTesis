 I first saw this game while volunteering in my daughter's second-grade class, where the teacher used it in one of the math activity centers. Being able to put numbers in sequential order is a critical skill, and this is such a fun way to teach it. After looking for the game everywhere, I finally saw this one (a reissue, I think, since it's kind of retro) and grabbed it. And although the box says 8-and-up, my 6-year-old son can play just fine. Sometimes we simplify the rules a little, and ignore the special green cards, which direct you to switch cards, trade with opponents, etc. Overall, a very fun, educational game! Highly recommended. :-
