 We love this game! My 3 year old is excited to have his very own game that we all enjoy playing. I agree with the previous reviewer: stick a few branches all the way through at the beginning for support and then don't worry if the rest go through to the other side. This way, the kids can help, too, and no one gets bored with set up. All you need to do with the branches is create a nest, of sorts, for the bees to lie on. Theoretically, the winner is the one with the fewest bees at the end. In my house, though, the winner is the one with the most! My kids love pulling a branch and having bees tumble out into their trays. This has been a great fit into family game time at our house.
