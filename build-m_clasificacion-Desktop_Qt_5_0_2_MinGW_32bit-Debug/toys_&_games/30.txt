 My son loved this tent. He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent. My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor. Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent. The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart. The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side. If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time? Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build. I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on
