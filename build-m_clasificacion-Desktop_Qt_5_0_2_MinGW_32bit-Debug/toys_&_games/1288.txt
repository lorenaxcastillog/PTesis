 I bought this for my 9 y/o nephew for Christmas he's been wanting it since his birthday. It's seems to be the hottest toy to get right now. I think your price of $399 you are charging is totally outrageous for this toy and whoever buys is it for that price is even more stupid. I bought it at Toys-R-Us for $79. They also have it at Target, Walmart and etc. You must be out of your mind to sell this for that price, It's a cute toy but it's definitely not worth over a $100. Even my nephew agrees with that
