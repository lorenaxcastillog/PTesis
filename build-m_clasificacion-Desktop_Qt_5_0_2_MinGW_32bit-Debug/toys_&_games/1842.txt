 My 6YO wanted this doll for Christmas, but I resisted. When she kept asking, I made a deal to buy it for her, in exchange for clearing out a substantial stash of old toys. She and her 3YO sister did all the work to select the toys for donation or trash. For that, I am grateful. But the Susie doll was a bust. They played with it for a day or two, then the novelty wore off, and she's been sitting in a corner ever since. She's not a particularly cute or cuddly doll. She's a little odd shaped, due to the growth ability and she has limited interaction
