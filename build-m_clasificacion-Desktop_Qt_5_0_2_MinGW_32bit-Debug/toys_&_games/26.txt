 This is a piece of garbage. The balls deflate after a couple hours. The rim is so frail it won't hold up to much. My friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point I got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking. They correctly pointed out that it says "Slam Dunk Challenge" right on the back board. Don't do it - it will break. When I turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses. So that function is worthless. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball.
