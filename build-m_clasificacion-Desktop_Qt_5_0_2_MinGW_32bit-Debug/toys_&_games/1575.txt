 I have this Barbie Nursery Playset and it compliments my barbie house quite well. The bouncy seat actually bounces (one must be gentle) and the keys are well loved by baby. The rest of the toys are ovbiously for an older sister or brother and that's cool, cause it teaches kids that they have to include the older children and teach them how to play with the baby. The crib is great-haven't had any problems with anything falling apart. The bottle warmer was a nice touch, an extra that doesn't usually come with kids toys today. The only problem I have with this toy is Midge. She lost her red hair and freckles! Other than that the arms do bend differently, it's so she can hold the tiny baby, and this barbie might be better off if saved for older children who understand the importance of being very carefull with the arms. All in all, love it! Keep up the good work Mattel!
