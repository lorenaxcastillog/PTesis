 We have had this for several years now. My two boys, now ages seven and five, play with this regularly (several times a week). It is great for imaginative play. They have made many scenes, besides just setting up plays. This is likely the most played toy item we have, and it looks to continue as a favorite for awhile. They also have the baseball and soccer sets, but football has been the favorite. The pieces are well made and everything is durable (the felt field is showing a little bit of wear after two years, but that is to be expected). The case is nice as the kids clean this up themselves by throwing everything in the box, although the felt field is a bit difficult for them to roll up and put away. If you have kids who are sports-minded, I highly recommend.
