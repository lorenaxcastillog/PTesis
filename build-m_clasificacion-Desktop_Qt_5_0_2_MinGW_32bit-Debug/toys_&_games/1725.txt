 This toy is really cool. My 3 1/2 year old daughter got it from her Pap-pap for Christmas. The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars is that for the price,$59.95+tx, it should have TOTALLY come with a dinner table, like in the picture, or a free pony. I also wish you didn't have to push in the purple platforms on the top level before closing the thing up tight. If you try to close it with the purple platforms protruding, you could break the purple platforms. The wand idea to make it open up into a castle is an excellent concept. My daughter loves her castle. It is really really cute. Just wish it came with more for the price
