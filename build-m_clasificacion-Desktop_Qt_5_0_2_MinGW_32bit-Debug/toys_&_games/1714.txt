 We bought two - one for a 1 year old (15lbs) and another for a 20 month old (35 lb). We also tried to use it with a 4 month old (13 lb). The only baby that actually could use it was the 1 year old. The 20 month old kept on throwing himself out of it (he's a monkey anyhow) and ended up not wanting anything to do with the float. The 4 month old was just a little too short and could put her face in water in the seat area. The 1 year old had an absolute blast
