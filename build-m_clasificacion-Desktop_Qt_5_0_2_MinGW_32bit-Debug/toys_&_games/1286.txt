 I brought one for my 14 year old son (at his request) for Christmas and he loves his. I decided I wanted a mp3 player, but decided to get one of these for myself just so that I could get adjusted to the technology. So far, it works great for me. I have about 25 - 30 songs on mine and it still has a little more memory left. I made sure I deleted the video clips that were installed on it before I started adding music since they take up a lot of space. I will admit that it took me about 10 - 15 minutes to figure out how to get the music on in. (thank goodness for a 14 year old to help out) But once I got the hang of it, it was a breeze. I will probably buy better headphones but I think it was a good buy overall
