 We got this bed for Christmas and our little car guy loves it!! We haven't had a problem with him falling out, but we used his crib (without the front rail) as a toddler bed first and after several nights of falling out, Eric found the boundries of the bed. Every child will probally fall out until they realize where the edge is. The bed is so adorable, but I wish that it came with more stickers. You can buy them for $30.00, but it would have been great if they were included. Overall Eric loves it and can't wait to go to bed!! It's a great bed for little racers!
