 The pool holds plenty of water and is colorful and inviting for the kids! The padding on the bottom is especially nice to cushion harder surfaces. Granted--a lot of inflation was needed, but we also bought the hand pump and that did the job (and gave us some exercise--but it did not wear us out--and we're grandparents)! I found the plug drain in the bottom no problem at all. We pulled the plug and came back later and all that was left was a little puddle in one corner. The height of the sides was great, but I would have liked it a little longer in length. Bottom line--this was a great buy!
