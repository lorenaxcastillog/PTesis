 I purchased Pablo for my son at 18 months old. This is the youngest age recommended by the manufacturer and I can see why. To activate Pablo, one must push one of his flippers. It isn't very difficult, but a child must be patient enough for you to show them where to push. Also, Pablo must be used on hard flooring. My son learned how to operate Pablo on his own in about 4 or 5 days, but he often puts him too close to the carpet or the wall & then Pablo stops and my son gets frustrated. All in all, this is a very cute toy & my son has enjoyed dancing and spinning along with Pablo. However, it is a little loud and it runs through high quality batteries rather quickly.
