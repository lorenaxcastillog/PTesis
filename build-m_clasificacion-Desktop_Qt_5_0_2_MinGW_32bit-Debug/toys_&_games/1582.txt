 I ordered two sets of these bricks for my 2 year old and 6 year old. They both will spend long periods of time playing with them. Although they don't play the same way, it is great to see them each playing with a toy that doesn't do the playing for them. No lights, sounds, or special effects!! I am VERY pleased with this purchase and would buy them again for a gift in a heartbeat. The assembly wasn't as complicated as I was expecting either. I had both sets folded and put together in under half an hour, and I wasn't trying to hurry either.
