 this pool is a great step up from a baby pool. my girls are 2 1/2 and 6 and love it. it's deep enough for really getting wet and not too huge like some inflateables. it's very comfortable for even a 6' adult to lounge around in. i bought it because of the drainage plug - a major timesaver, and the inflateable bottom. i gave it 4 stars because the seam on the inner ring split a tiny bit after a week, but my girls did jump in it like trampoline for 3 days before we filled it. i would buy another
