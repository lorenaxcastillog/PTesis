 It's amazing how Bandai can create such fun toys! Hey there! If you want to buy a Tamagotchi v4, but yet, you aren't sure? GET IT! If you are a Tama - holic like me, you know what it's like to have a tamagotchi. A tamagotchi is like a portable almost lifelike keychain pet. You feed it, train it, punish it, clean up after it and exercise it. Long story short, you keep it alive :P. And now, with the new V4, you can even turn it in to school! The higher your training points are, the better character you can get. Breed tamagotchi with your friends, and have loads of other fun things. With Tamagotchi, you never know what's gonna happen next..
