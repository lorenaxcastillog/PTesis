 My husband and I bought this for our three year old son this past December and my son has been in it everyday (we live in FL)!! The radio is great- picks up all the best stations and the simulated CD is great as well. The battery lasts and lasts before it needs recharging. I rated it a 5 for educational as well because we are learning our right and left turns in a fun way at an early age, as well as early driving skills and confidence. I would advise if giving it as a gift to charge the battery well in advance (first charge needs 24-30 hours). It is really big, our 12 yr old neighbor had a ride (up to 130lbs!) Seats two, and my 6 month old will be able to ride it as well soon enough!It is very durable and comes with an extra wheel rim! The only thing that would make it better is rubber strips on the wheels and a little horn
