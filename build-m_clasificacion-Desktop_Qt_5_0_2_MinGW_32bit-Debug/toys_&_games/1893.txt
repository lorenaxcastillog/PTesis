 Adorable item. My son loves this. It is our special teddy bear we use only at night. In the morning he tells me to "put it away" until nap time or bed time. Very soft. After my son stayed at my sister's house, her son wants one now too! After I bought this, I realized that you can purchase the wand for it to turn on the light show from another location. I wish I would have known that before. Yes, as the others have said, the battery pack is a bit hard. It is adorable. I just bought this a month or so ago, and the price has almost doubled. I don't know if I would have purchased it for this price - can it be that much better
