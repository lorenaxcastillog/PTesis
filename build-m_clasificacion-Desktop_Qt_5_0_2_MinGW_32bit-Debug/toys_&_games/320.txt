 My 4 year old son loves all things Rescue Hero! His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year ago now. I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy! They all love it! This thing has stood up to all of their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents! He had just went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist. It is very large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just HAD to get this too! I highly recommend this toy for all ages! Great imaginary play
