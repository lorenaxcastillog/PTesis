 My daughter got this set for her birthday (which is in a few days) from her Uncle. I let her open it early so we can stretch out her birthday into a week full of celebrations! She loves this set. She was able to do most of this on her own BUT there were several parts that she needed help with. The instruction book that came with it is excellent and really helped her "see" what she needed to do next. We completed all the little houses and are halfway through Spongbob's house. Had to stop for bedtime, I am such a mean Mom I know! She can't wait to get the Krusty Krab set as well. This was our first venture into the "little" Legos and it went much smoother than I anticipated when I opened the box and saw all the tiny parts! We are storing the extra pieces in zip lock bags until we need them, so keep them from getting lost.
