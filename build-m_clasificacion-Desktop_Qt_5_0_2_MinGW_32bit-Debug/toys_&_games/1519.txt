 There is nothing like waking up at 2AM few nights in a row to the voice saying " O is for Olive". Keep in mind that it takes you a few moments before you can correctly determine that it is a puzzle talking, and not an intruder or "voices" that you are now hearing. (I completely panicked the first two times). And it will keep repeating the phrase 20+ times (I counted), so you will HAVE to get out of bed, in the middle of the night to look for a screwdriver, so that you can take out the batteries, because there is no off switch
