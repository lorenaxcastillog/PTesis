 Quite a few reviews compared ZOOB to Legos which is to compare apples to oranges. I have been a major Lego fan since I could assemble two blocks, and have already purchased sets for my son, but Legos are more about building buildings, boats, man-made things in general, whereas ZOOB is much more organic allowing you to create living movable things such as dinosaurs, spiders, snakes, creatures of all shapes, including the primordial. You can also build cars and motorcycles, but the point is this toy is more for building singular objects rather than the cities and villages I used to build with Legos. The toy is sturdy if handled properly. It has been entertaining for the adults and children in our family
