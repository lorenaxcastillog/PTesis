 We bought these keys for our then 18 month old, when he was obsessed with keys and had set my car alarm off one too many times. The toy is great. The key chain is big so its easy for kids to hang onto, the buttoms are colorful and appropriately sized, and make honking noises, car starting noises, etc.. They keys are metal like, not plastic, so the toy feels more realistic. My now 3 year old still plays with them and still takes them places with us. Word of warning, because these keys are not plastic, be very careful where your child puts them. As we were leaving to the store one day I handed my son his keys, grabbed mine and while I was putting my purse in the front seat my son was keying up the lock on the back door trying to open it. YIKES! These keys can scatch, so a word of warning.
