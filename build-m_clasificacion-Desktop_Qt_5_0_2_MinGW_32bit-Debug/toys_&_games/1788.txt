 I bought the Monkey,Bear and Dog here on Amazon and it is the favorite gift for my Girls this year. These sold in Walmart and Kmart in my area(GA) for 24 each and I got all three for under $60 bucks. They are wonderful for kids that are afraid of the dark. The light shows are awesome! If you think that it only lights up a little you are wrong.....I can walk by my girls and see their whole faces, sound asleep and holding on to their "light stuffies" for dear life. To clean just use a baby wipe and make sure you buy rechargeable batteries. LOVE THIS IDEA. They also have pillows and blankets at some websites
