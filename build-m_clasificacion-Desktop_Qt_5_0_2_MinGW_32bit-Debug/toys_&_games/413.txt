 My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop. For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter.
