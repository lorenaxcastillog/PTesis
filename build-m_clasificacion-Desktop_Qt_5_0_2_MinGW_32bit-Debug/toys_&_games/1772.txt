 We had bought this for ds for the summer time and it is great. We got a lot of bubbles from one wand, when blowing slow and steady. If we blow too hard, or shake the wand too fast then we only get a couple small bubbles. These wands are the perfect grip for my 2 year old, meaning nice and thick. The only problem I have is that so much solution gets on the wand, that the solution drips all over the place and on clothing. My son has no problem sticking the wand in the slots and pulling it back out. This is a lot better than letting little ones use the jug of bubbles, or the handheld no spills ones that normally get tipped over and leak everywhere.
