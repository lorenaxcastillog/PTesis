 My 4 year old granddaughter thought this Barbie was so beautiful and wanted this one to play with, along with her many other dolls. I wanted to get it for her but could not see paying the retail price just for her to play with. I went on line after Christmas looking for the Erika Doll and found this one for [...]. I was shocked and ordered it right away. It was brand new in mint condition. I got the item within a few days and my granddaughter was delighted. I have ordered several items from Amazon.com and will continue doing so. I shop for bargains and this was the best one by far. Thanks to Amazon.com
