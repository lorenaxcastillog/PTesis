 This is the perfect set for beginners. Super easy to do------just imagine play doh and Mr. Potato Head merging together. This set allows the 2-3 year old crowd to be creative without the frustration of some of the other more complicated sets. Really all the child needs to know how to do is make a mass (ball, blob, or other) with the play doh and then stick the parts they want in wherever they want them. The plastic pieces (eyes,noses,ears,feet,tails, etc.) are made of really good quality plastic. There is also a mold included to make baby animals and texture tools that you just simply press onto the play doh. My son received this a couple of months before he turned 3, but I think he could've handled this even at the age of 2
