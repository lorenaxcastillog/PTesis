 My daughter received this for her 1st birthday last summer and she loves it! It is very durable and roomy. Sometimes my daughter stands on the lid (she is now 2 and weighs 28 lbs.) but I can just pop it back into original shape. I did read previous reviews regarding the lid but the lid on my sandbox is VERY sturdy and has not blown off (though the umbrella has numerous times). Again, this was purchase last summer so I think the lid has changed. The only problem is that the lid is slightly heavy and akward for me to put back on. My daughter can get in and out of the picnic table without my help and it is a perfect size for her. The table is roomy enough for her cousins (ages 2 and 4) to sit with her.
