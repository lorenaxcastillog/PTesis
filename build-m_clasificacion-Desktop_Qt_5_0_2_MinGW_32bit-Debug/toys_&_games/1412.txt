 This was THE item my eight year old wanted for Christmas. We searched high and low finally paying too much for the product. While it looks cool, the RV doesn't hold together very well. The balls that dissolve and turn into aliens are a one-time deal and most of the rest of the set hasn't been played with since Christmas. The action figures get more play than the RV and everything connected with. My advice is to save the money and pick up a couple of the action figures because your kids will get far more fun and use out those than this set. It really was cool in theory but rarely gets played with.
