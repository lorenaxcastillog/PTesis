 We've been playing Apples to Apples for years and it's awesome! We make sure to bring it every summer when all the families gets to together for a week in Maine because this is one of the few games we all can play, even the little ones. We have the orginal Apples to Apples and all the expansion sets that I know of, I beleive there were 3. My questions is, since the "Party Box" version includes the expansion sets, does the Party Expansion Set have new cards that have never been released before? We'd love to have new cards since we play it so much!
