 We got this item for our 1 yr old daughter. This thing is great, it was set up in minutes and will somewhat keep the toddler in one place, by that I mean even our 1 yr old is able to push the playpen around and move it across the living room. Thats the only problem that I can see. The construction is very good because with a 5yr old and a 7yr old (that have no concept of the door) insist on climbing over the sides time after time, has held up very well. Being made of plastic it can be taken outside and cleaned with a garden hose and mild soap. I would highly recommend to anyone
