 If you are in the minimize-mess, maximize thinking and motion mode, this is a great toy. The box says 3 and up, but our twins are 2 1/2 and love it. I think they could have been enjoying this 6 months ago. It is so much fun to see them discovering that they can make the music and tempo go according to their motions. I like it too. You'll find me dancing around it after bedtime! It is just 1 piece so there is no mess involved, but it really gets the kids moving and experimenting. I bought this over a year ago on a closeout sale online somewhere for about $15 and I just recently got it out. What a deal for a great toy. I have had no problems getting it to work correctly
