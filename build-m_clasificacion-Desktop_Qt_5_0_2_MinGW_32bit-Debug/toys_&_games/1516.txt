 The shape of the swing, curved like a sling, makes my 2-year old son slide down. He can't sit up straight and slides into a slouch. In colder weather, when he is wearing more than a light jacket, the bulk of the jacket makes it impossible to even get him to stay in the swing. Since there is no way for him to sit up straight and slide his rear end back (even without the jacket), he ends up right on the edge of the swing when wearing a jacket, with his body in basically a straight position which causes him to slide right off. Plus, the harness straps are not very long when adjusted to their maximum, so with a heavier jacket they don't fit. I'm not talking about a big child here either. At 29 months, my son still only weighs 25 pounds. I'm taking this off our swingset and getting a Little Tikes toddler swing
