 I bought this canopy for my daughter's room and she LOVES it. It is VERY reasonable priced compared to most canopies. If you like to do craft projects this is for you. I did decorate it for my daughter (she's only 3), so I could see it being difficut for younger children. the pens are small and do not have enough glitter. I didn't have a problem with the drying time though. I decorated the butterfly at night and glued the gems then too, and it was ready for assembly in the morning. I am going to get some of the coordinating items to finish off her room
