 This was the first real toy we bought my son (other than real baby toys), he was 6 months at the time. From the moment we brought it home, he LOVED it! It comes with three balls that you drop in a slot and they come rolling out - he never got into that part even to this day but he loved and loves hitting the different parts of the workbench with the hammer and hearing the sounds and seeing the lights flash. It also has a winding crank and some other great little features that kids love. Now he is 20 months and although it's no longer one of the main toys he plays with I do see him go over and give it a whirl here and there and I still see the same excitment in his eyes just like the first time. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get rid of this toy not because my son is so attached but because I am attached to the memories of his very first toy and would hate to see it go
