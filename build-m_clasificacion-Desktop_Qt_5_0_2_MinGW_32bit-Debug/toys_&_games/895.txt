 Overall, this is a cute little set to dress your child like Superman w/o spending lots of money. It comes with a vinyl cape, Superman plastic chest emblem, and plastic chain to pull apart and pretend like you're the man of steel. It will probably fit an average child up to about 6 or 7 years old. The chest shield has velcro straps on the top and bottom that stretch around the child's arm/shoulder area - so if your child is particulary large, it may not be comfortable to wear this. The vinyl cape attaches with velcro at the neck. One of the velcro tabs fell off and the vinyl started to rip (underneath the tab area) the very first day my son wore this. We took it back and exchanged it for another one. Even though the cape doesn't seem extremely durable, I'd still recommend it as a fun accessory for any little Superman fan. One more thing... I think the cape and Superman shield would look better in RED instead of the reddish brown color they ended up using. I'm not sure how many kids would care too much about the color though!
