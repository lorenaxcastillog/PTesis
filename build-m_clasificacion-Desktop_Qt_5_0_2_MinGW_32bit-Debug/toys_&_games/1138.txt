 We bought this puzzle for our daughter's first birthday - hoping to counter some of the noisier toys we suspected she would recieve (and she did). To our great pleasure it was well-recieved, and is something she enjoys tinkering with whilst making her rounds of the toys. The pieces are large and - unlike so many first puzzles - are made out of thick, sturdy plywood. They are painted with non-toxic paints, rather than having a layer of paper like many other puzzles which so quickly become soggy and unusable the first time they find their way into the mouth. The only downside is that the pieces do have slightly rough edges - I think I may end up taking a piece of sandpaper to them at some point just to smooth them out a bit. And, as the other reviewer noted, this can cause difficulty in getting the pieces in. Despite this minor flaw this is an excellent learning tool for young toddlers, and I highly recommend it
