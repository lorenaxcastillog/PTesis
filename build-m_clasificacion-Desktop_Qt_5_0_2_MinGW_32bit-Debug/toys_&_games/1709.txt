 my 3 yo loves it. The geomotion system will stop the train as it comes through (in the right position to load or unload stuff from a train car), and uses the train's motor (based on a gear on the bottom of the train) to slow rotate the crain head in a circle. It is great, I sit on the couch with the remote control. Train drives under the crane, stops, the crane head rotates around until it aligns with the load. I use the train remote to stop it, my 3yo cranks on the handle to lift the load, I start the train engine to rotate the load to teh train, stop the train, and he lowers the load into the train. Then he moves the lever that allows the train to leave the building, and I start the train, and drive it around the track. And he does it again, and again, and again. Meanwhile, I am saving my knees cause for this toy (and only for this toy) I don't have to be down on the floor with him. Fisher Price has a winner
