 The primary purpose of a coin sorter is to put the correct number of coins into the appropriate wrapper so you can take it to the bank. That's what I bought mine for, anyway. This thing is so imprecise that you never really know how many coins are in the wrapper. As a result, if you really want to be sure you have to count them. That's a huge drag and sort of defeats the purpose of owning this machine as far as I'm concerned. Also, the "overflow" reservoir is where 25% of the coins end up whether the tubes are full or not. I previously owned a coin sorter that was similar to this one as far as its simplicity etc. but much more reliable. Don't waste your pennies on the Ultra Sorter
