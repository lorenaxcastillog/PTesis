 You'd have to look hard to find a better party game than this. First of all, it's very easy to play--the rules are so simple that anyone can learn to play it. Second of all, it really gets everyone who is playing to talk and joke around. The set is made up of red cards and green cards. The green cards have adjectives on them and they players then try to choose the best match from the red cards, which have nouns on them, in their hand. Of course, everyone will have a different opinion, so the fun begins. I bought this recently and tried it out at several parties, and it was a great success. In fact, it was difficult to get people to stop playing. And to make it even better, some blank cards are included, so you can add some of your own ideas to personalize the game. If you don't have this, you really need to pick it up. You'll love it if you do
