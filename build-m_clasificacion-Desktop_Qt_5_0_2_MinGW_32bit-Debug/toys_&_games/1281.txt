 I first played this game at my buddy's house over the summer, and after a few questions about Pearl Jam, 90210, MJ, and "Wild" Bill Clinton, I was sold! This game is great to play before you head out or if you have a bunch of friends over and just want to have a great time reliving the glory days of the 90's. The questions are perfect -- not too easy and not too difficult -- so that the game moves at a fun, rapid pace. I'd highly recomend this game to anyone who remembers Jump Around, Melrose Place, Magic Johnson, or Monica Lewinsky. And for those who dont...it's never to late to live the 90's
