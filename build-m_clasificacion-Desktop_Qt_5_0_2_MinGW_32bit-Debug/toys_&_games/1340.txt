 Another great thinking game from "Think Fun". I belong to a homeschool "strategy labs" group, which is run by a former gifted and talented public school teacher, and she introduced me to Think Fun games. My children thoroughly enjoy them, and have more patience than I would have expected to try and solve the puzzles. A previous reviewer said that this game is good for "gifted" children, and I'm sure it is, but I think it is a great game for ANY child who likes to solve puzzles, regardless of their giftedness at them. I would even buy this game (or perhaps River Crossing Jr, or Rush Hour) for a child who DOESN'T particularly like puzzles, because with some adult encouragement, the child may really enjoy it (thus learning that he/she DOES like puzzles) and improve his ability to think visually and plan several moves ahead - quite a nice bonus.
