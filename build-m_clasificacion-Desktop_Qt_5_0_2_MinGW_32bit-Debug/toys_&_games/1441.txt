 We got this in at the store I work at, and we were all enchanted! This was the very first time any of us had seen a set of play food for young children of sushi! Three kinds of sushi come with shrimp, tuna, salmon roe, and egg pieces. The proper condiments are included: ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce, and of course, chopsticks! The round "dots" on the sushi rolls are velcro, so that you can stick the pieces together and slice through them with the play cleaver, and the velcro even gives it an almost authentic chopping sound! It is just lovely to look at. All of the pieces are solid wood, and beautifully painted. The box is in black with details of cherry blossoms, and it has a "menu" on the back for restauraunt pretend play! I plan to get one for a friend's child, but I have to admit that I'm really tempted to buy one for myself, too
