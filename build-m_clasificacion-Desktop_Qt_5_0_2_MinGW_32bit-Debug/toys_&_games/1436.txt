 The Anakin Skywalker Ep. III FX Lightsaber is essential for the Star Wars collector. The Lightsaber from the butt end of the handle to the tip of the blade is very well made. The blade is made from very durable plastic and the handle from alumium(forgive misspelling). Powered by AA batteries, the lifespan of one set of batteries has a impressive length. Sound effects are great, I love the power-up and power-down feature, which is incorprated in light and sound. Although, this patictular lightsaber was a birthday gift, I own three FX lightsabers myself. I am impressed and satisfied with all of them. Thank You
