 The game itself is actully pretty good. You can go through the entire Price is right game or you can just go to each section. Like if you just wanted to do the pricing games, there's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc... There are times that the graphics of the game lag, which is kind of odd since to me since I wasn't playing it on a computer, but on my DVD player. The pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games. You can technically play this game by yourself, but it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have
