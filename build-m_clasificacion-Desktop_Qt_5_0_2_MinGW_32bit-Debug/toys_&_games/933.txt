 My son ONLY asked for this for Christmas, so I had to get it. It doesn't do much -- he was bored with it within a few days. It shoots the harmless "bullets" pretty far, but not easily aimed. The pincher on our first one didn't work so we had to send it back for a replacement. Pincher STILL isn't very strong & basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't "lift" objects, just grabs them & drags them around--and you have to hold a button continuously to hold the object. And LOUD -- VERY LOUD -- the legs hit the floor VERY hard (though I haven't noticed any scratches on the floor). We have a small house & you can hear the bug from one end to the other. I would NOT buy this again. There are MUCH more interactive RC toys out there
