 My 21 month old daughter received Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it
