 I bought this for my 5 yr old son who will be entering kindergarten this fall. I really think he does better counting on his fingers! Some of the games are hard for him to get started on his own. I need to sit and help him along which is fine most of the time, but I thought this would be something we could take on vacation and he could do on his own during the long car ride. That's probably not going to happen. Although, for the price I would give it 4 stars. Maybe it's his disinterest I'm disappointed with
