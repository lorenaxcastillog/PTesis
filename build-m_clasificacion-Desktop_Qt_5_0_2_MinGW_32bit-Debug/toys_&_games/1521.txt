 My daughter just loves this wagon! We rented it at a local amusement park and she did not want to get out. We knew we had to have one. We loved the fact that it had an actual axle for easy turning. Our previous wagon had the wheels that were directly connected to the wagon and was super hard to turn. They would get stuck sideways and you could not get the thing to move. This is the only plastic wagon we could find with a front axle which made this a top choice for us! This is a great choice for children that are too old for a stroller but too small to walk. We loved the storage underneath and the cup holders. We also like that it holds two children with plenty of room for all of their stuff!! Lastly, we loved that the surface is flat so the children can nap if they are tired!!(Our last wagon had the seats on each end so this was not an option) *We are planning on buying the attachable umbrellas offered by Radio Flyer this summer to protect our little ones from the sun (another great plus!
