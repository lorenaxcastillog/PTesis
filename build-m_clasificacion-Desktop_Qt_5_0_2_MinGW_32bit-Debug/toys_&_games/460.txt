 I'll start off by saying that THIS is the company to buy Naruto headbands from. It is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone's head (trust me, I have a pretty big head). The insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly. A velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate doesn't touch your forehead and cause discomfort. In other words, this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself, and for the price, it is a very nice addition to any Naruto fan's wardrobe
