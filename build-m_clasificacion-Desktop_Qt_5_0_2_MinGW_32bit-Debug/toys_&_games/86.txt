 Our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age, yet the batmobile is much too small for him. For a kid who loves batman, it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination. But after just 2 or 3 days, he gave up and returned to his tricycle. As a result, except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it, the batmobile has been a waste of money. On the other hand, for a child of 3, it should be fun, I think, for at least awhile
