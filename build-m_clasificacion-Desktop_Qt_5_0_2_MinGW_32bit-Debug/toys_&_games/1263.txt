 I purchased this house about 3 years ago for my then 2 y/o twin boys and 4 y/o son. They absolutely loved it. It was very durable. It easily snapped into place and we chose not to use the screws in the roof. The roof was secure without the screws and it was easier to take apart and move. I assembled myself and it didn't take me long to do. The 3 boys all played in the house together and there was plenty of room. As they got older and started climbing on the roof we passed this toy onto someone else.
