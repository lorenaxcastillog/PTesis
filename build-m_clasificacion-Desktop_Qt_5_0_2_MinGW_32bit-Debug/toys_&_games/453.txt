 Well, I just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product. Can you even imagine her tooting? She's too cute! The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends. This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell. One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device. Please use a real loud whistle. You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid. If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way. This whistle is for good times only.
