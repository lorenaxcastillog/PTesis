 This is a very nice introductory weaving set. I did a small amount of weaving when I was younger, and this is a very nice set for children. I bought this for my 7 year old SON, who is very artistic and he is having great fun with it. My 9 year old is also very interested in it, so I am going to get another kit. But BEWARE!!! If you are buying this. The box only has girls on it!!!! I almost sent it back for fear that it would turn my boys off with the message that this is only for girls. Luckily, my sons don't pay a lot of attention to this, but ALEX should be more careful about the messages they are sending. Weaving is a great hobby for girls AND boys. Some of the greatest weavers in history have been men and in some native cultures, only men were allowed to weave. Weaving is a great and relaxing hobby that both girls and boys should be encouraged to enjoy. If not for the marketing issues, I would have given this item 5 stars
