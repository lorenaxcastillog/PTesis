 I bought this item for my 6 year old niece. Not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked (colors were not bright like other Cars toys), I was absolutely disgusted with the name calling in one of the sayings. I realized when it called the tractor a negative name, stupid I believe it was, that it was going back. I wouldn't want my child having a toy that calls others names, so I wont give it to anyone either. Not to mention, the grammar used, is not correct. I realize that is the character, but why would I want to teach children grammer that is wrong? All in all, disapointment, that Disney puts out toys like this
