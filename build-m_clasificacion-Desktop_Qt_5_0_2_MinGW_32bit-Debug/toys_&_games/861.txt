 I purchased this product from Target and found the price to be the cheapest. It took me over 3 hours to put it together. First, I had to find the screws (HIDDEN IN THE PLASTIC DRAWS). I was able to put together the bottom pieces inside frame, I had to worst time putting the side panels. They did not match with the holes and when getting them in the inside frame came out. I was able to get it, with a lot of moving the wood. The other side panel was IMPOSSIBLE to line up with the dowels. I had to have my husband move the wood, while I placed the screws. Finally, when everything was done and filled with my daughter's toys and books, it looks great in her bedroom. MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE A/C ON, WHEN PUTTING TOGETHER. YOU WILL SWEAT A WHOLE LOT WITH GETTING THE SIDES UP.
