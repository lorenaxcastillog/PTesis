 We got this over two years ago for my daughter when she was 6 months old. We were looking for a mobile that wasn't "traditional." She still loves it and so does her baby sis. Yes, there isn't a sun, but if you look at the proportions, you would need a beach ball for the sun! We hung the planets from differ lengths of fishing line. Our only problem was Jupiter was too low and we kept hitting it. That was easy to fix. Don't forget to put the star stickers on the star tacks. If a tack fall out of the ceiling, you can use a flashlight at night to locate it quickly!
