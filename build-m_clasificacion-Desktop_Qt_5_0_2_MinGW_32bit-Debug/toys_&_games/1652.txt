 We finally bought this game for our little boy as an early birthday gift. He begged for this game for a couple of months and I really did'nt think he was old enough for it but he proved us wrong and is better at playing the game than me or my husband! Its a really fun game just like the classic version but its much more fun for my little boy since he is a Shrek fan! The pieces you have to get or operate are so funny, there is a frog in Shreks throat, ear wax, toe jam, onion breath, heart burn, pixie bites and much more! It just makes the game more fun with Shrek being the person you have to operate on! I would suggest this game if you are thinking about buying it, it is still getting played after weeks of playing it my little boy is still having fun with it
