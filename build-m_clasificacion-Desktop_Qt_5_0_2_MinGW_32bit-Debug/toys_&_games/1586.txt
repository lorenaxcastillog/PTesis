 I have to say that if I had it to do over again, I never would have let my son see the Fisher Price catalog and pick his Christmas present. He saw the Shake n Go racetrack and wanted it and the Mater and Lightening McQueen cars immediately. I am not so happy about it because it takes a lot to keep the race going. The cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around the race track before they have to be shaken again and then by the time the race is over, your wrist hurts. My son is only 3 and he doesn't know to shake it enough so for him, it's just not that fun. He likes it but easily gets discouraged with it when he can't make the cars go more than one lap, if that. I would NOT recommend this for 3-5 yr. olds. Maybe the older kids, but I wouldn't buy it again. I wish I could get my money back, but the box and all it's wrappings went out with the Christmas wrap to the trash. Do Not Waste Your Money
