 These shake and go cras are lots of fun. You simply shake and depending how much or how little force is used will determine how far these guys go. Using the on off button while not in use seems to lengthen the life of the batteries as we have still not replaced them after months of use. The amusement value is even greater when these cars are used with multiple children( or adults) as they can be raced. Change the dynamics of fun when you take them outside as they tumble and bounce back on all different types of terrain as we just recently discovered. Overall this is a cute fun little toy. I might be stretching but Ihink there is some educational value in this car as the child must learn that the more force they epend when shaking the further the car will go, kinda like physics? So all in all a cool little toy reasonably priced
