 I've so far put away this toy except for the shark, as I don't feel my four year old son is ready for all the small pieces perhaps till his 5th birthday. The shark is excellent and floats beautifully in the bath, unlike the usual plastic fish and sharks that we have. The boat looks good, although I'm not sure I want to see all those small pieces going in the bath. The oars are very unsteady, so I'm thinking the little boat would go well in the bath by itself, and leave the rest of the pieces for table top play. Very cute pirate, and I'm sure the seagull has some words to say to him
