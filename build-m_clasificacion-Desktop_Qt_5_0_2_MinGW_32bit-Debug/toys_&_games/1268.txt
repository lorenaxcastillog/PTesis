 My two youngest sons (age 11 months and 24 months) love this toy. It was a bear to build. The instructions have no words and the pictures are general. It also requires a lot of screws to be placed. The holes are not pre-drilled. The swings on the extension move on the ropes and aren't very safe. I have replaced the swings with immobile seats that snug into the kids. They have endless fun and don't like to come inside. The small slide goes on either side of the lower platform and the other side is left open. I wish there were steps or another slide. Overall, the small kids like it a lot, but my seven year old (weighing 55lbs) is a little too heavy for it. The platforms sag when he is on it
