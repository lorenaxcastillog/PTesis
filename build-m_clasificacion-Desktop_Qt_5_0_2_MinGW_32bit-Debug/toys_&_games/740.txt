 My almost 5 year old son loves driving his Jeep all over the neighborhood. Because of the better handling and wheel design (not slanted), the Jeep is remarkably agile. What my kid has done so far: - Taken the Jeep off road on bike trails - Drive through iced dirt - Drive through 1/2" mud - Drive through 1/4" water puddles - Pull passengers on a tied on Wagon (We almost died laughing) I agree with the previous reviewer that the car is a bit big for a sub 3 year old, but my younger one (2.5) loves being the passenger.
