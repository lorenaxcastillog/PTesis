 If you are thinking of purchasing this car, note that the seat is small and the length to the pedals is short. Thefore, it is suited for small children. The description says children 3+, but when our 4.5 year old (who is very small for 4.5) tried it out, it was way too small. It was extremely difficult for our child to pedal comfortably. It has alot of interesting buttons for sound effects, but I would say that based on the size of the seat and the length to the pedals that this is more ideally suited for children 3 or 4 only.
