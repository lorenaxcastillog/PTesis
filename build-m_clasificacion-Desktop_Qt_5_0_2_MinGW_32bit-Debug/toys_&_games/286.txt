 I hate spiders (yes I admitt that I make my wife kill them) and so does Miss Muffet...or is she. As her outfit might suggest, looks like Miss Muffet as a bit of a fetish going on, need I say S&M, and with that said, being pinned (blindly I might add) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think. You'd expect to see Miss Muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe, blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'Twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected. I say kudos to you McFarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale (nursury rhyme, whatever) and giving us yet another piece of art
