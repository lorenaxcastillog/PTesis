 My daughter previously owned the Fisher Price Dream Dollhouse that I bought her used along with MANY accessories. She got the Twin Time Dollhouse for Christmas and wants to play with it every day. I am usually the one who gets to play too and I will say that I love it!!! It doesn't have the conformed cabinets, etc. in the kitchen like the older ones or any conformed shelving so it's totally up to the child which room is which. I will say that the rooms are a little small and do get crowded but she loves it just the same. Suggestion for Fisher Price: Next time make rooms a little larger and add some rooms for more great fun.
