 My son loves this game. When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps. My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks. Mom, dad and sis had to play before that. The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it
