 i needed a kitchen for my 3 yr old daughter that would fit into a very small space...but one that was enjoyable to play with. we received it very quickly, in time for her birthday, and although she has not played with it yet; i did a test run on it and it seems to be made very well; especially for the price. it is small but has many different little areas that she can work on that either slide out or open up. It would probably be difficult for more than two children, max, to really play with this at the same time (again b/c of the size) unless they had some other accompanying toys like table and chairs so that one child could be the chef and the others could help preapre the food at the table or be the customers, taking turns, etc... as for the tipping over part that another reviewer mentioned, hers will be against a wall; as i think most people have their toy kitchens so i dont think that would be a problem. in all; a good basic kitchen for a great price
