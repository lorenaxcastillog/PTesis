 I was trying to figure out how to get the Barbie Jamin Jeep home from the retailers, if I bought it for my youngest daughter for Christmas, as my car was too small. My older daughter suggested going to [...]. I did. It was easy to do. They had what I wanted, at the same price...minus the local tax. It was delivered...FREE of Charge, in a timely manner. The service was exceptional...no lines, no hastle, no transportation problems. It was the best choice I made over the holiday season. Needless to say my younger daughter was thrilled. She loves it.
