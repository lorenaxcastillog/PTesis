 My son received this car for his first birthday. At that time he did not have the fine motor skills needed to use the keys etc to fix the car, but he loves to push it on the floor and watch it go and crash when it bumped into things. It kept him busy in the kitchen in the evenings while I cooked. Now that it is coming closer to the two year mile marker, he is learning to use the keys to refuel the engine and fix the problems on the car when it breaks down. It is just challenging enough to him to be fun, and it also dishes out rewards when he gets it right. This toy is very durable and the planning that went into it is fantastic. It has just enough sounds to keep him entertained but not be annoying! A+ at our house
