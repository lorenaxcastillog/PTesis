 This is a wonderful wood puzzle for the toddler who finds the baby wood puzzles too easy but who doesn't quite have the dexterity (or patience) to fit together classic puzzle shaped pieces. Because it is all wood, it can stand up to the wear and tear of a toddler. My son (20 months) found this hard at first, but was thrilled to have the challenge and would not stop working on it for days until he could do it easily. The picture is underneath the pieces. The is one of my son's very favorite toys of all time! He also loves the school bus one that is similar by the same company
