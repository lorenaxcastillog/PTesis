 My son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly. Talked about it for a month so we got it for him. He was super excited when he got and and the thing didn't work. It just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears. He was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it, then say he was no where near it. Then when he was standing next to it, it said he was no where near it. He was so disappointed. He thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him. We followed the directs and helped him play with it. He's 4. ( He wasn't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it doesn't work for some kids.) I think this is a terrible toy and Hayley's now in the trash. She's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with
