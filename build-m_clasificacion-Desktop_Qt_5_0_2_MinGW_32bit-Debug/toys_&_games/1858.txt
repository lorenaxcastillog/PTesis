 This deck is better than Kaiba's. People usually only buy Kaiba's deck for the Blue Eyes.. but if you want it so bad, buy it seperate. Yugi's deck actually has a strategy set in in. It's got an assorted variety off all types of cards, and no, I'm not only saying this because it's got a stupid axe of despair and a Black Luster Soldier, but because it's a strategic deck that's been put together for us to buy. But don't try using this in tournaments because most people know this deck like the back of their head. Wait, do people know what the back of their head looks like? Hang on, wait a moment while I try andd see the back of my head.. =
