 I just recently bought this item for my younger sister who is actually studying Psychology... needles to say she loved it! From the hilarious packaging including some of his most notable quotes to his phallic cigar, this item makes the perfect gift for anyone interested in Psychology, whether they agree with Freud's theories or not. The seller did also a great job in packaging and shipping it so the box came in perfect conditions, as my sister obviously sees this as a collector piece to be placed in her office... =) And yeah, he looks like the typical movie villain, cigar included...
