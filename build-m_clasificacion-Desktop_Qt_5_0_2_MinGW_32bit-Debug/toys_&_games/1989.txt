 My five year old twins recieved the deluxe set (basically 2 Junior sets packaged together) for their birthday a few days ago and have been playing with them nonstop ever since. Its the first thing they pick up when they wake up in the morning. My children love building things so it is hard to say whether a child who doesn't enjoy that kind of activity would love them as much but the wedgits are fascinating, colorful and easy to manipulate. My kids delight in building their own structures as well as the many designs in the book and haven't needed much outside help from me. When they go to bed I play with them too. The toy in its plastic holder is attractive, almost like a piece of modern art. Overall a great toy
