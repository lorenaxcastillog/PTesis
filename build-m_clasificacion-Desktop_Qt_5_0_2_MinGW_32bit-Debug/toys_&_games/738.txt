 We got the Darth Tater for our 5 yr old daughter wen we went to the Disney Star Wars Weekend. It was a "gift from Mickey" that she got one morning (her 9 yr old cousin got the Spud Trooper). It was great, and they immediately loved them. While at Disney MGM we stopped in the one toy story themed store to get exclusive Disney parks potato parts (fill a box for $10). When we got home, there was the other potato waiting as a "GFM". Now when her friends come over they have 2 potatoes and some hillarious disney park only pieces. The little mermaid battles a spud tropper bearing a cinderella slipper. This is a great toy for the young kids because it is for the 3+ crowd but mom and dad get a hoot from playing with the potatoes too! Now we are just rying to find the R2Potat2
