 My daughter really loves her iQuest! She takes it everywhere with her. She uses almost every function every day. The iQuest is great for studying while your child feels as if he/she is playing a game. My daughter studies what she learned in school every night with her iQuest by choosing her school textbook from the list. Sometimes we play the games together. The only problem is that there is no backlight and no attachable light, so my daughter always has to be in a well-lit room to use this interesting gadget. Unless you choose to ride in the car with the light on, your child may want to pack a gameboy as well :
