 THIS IS THE WORST VACUUM EVER - WE HAVE EVERY SINGLE TOY VACUUM OUT THERE AND THEY ARE ALL PRETTY GOOD BUT THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND THE CHEAPEST BUILT - IT IS SO TINY! IT WAS BROKE THE FIRST NIGHT - IT DOESN'T SUCK AT ALL!! WELL IT DOES SUCK - BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE LITTLE STYROFOAM BEADS THAT COME WITH IT! OR EVEN THE LIGHTEST PIECE OF LINT - WITH SHIPPING AND TAX THIS ITEM WAS $40.00 AND I WILL LOOSE ALMOST $15.00 IN TOTAL SHIPING TO GET IT HERE AND TO SEND IT BACK ! I AM STILL RETURING IT AND BUYING A REAL CANISTER VACUUM FOR $20.00 AT WALMART - PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
