 I bought this for my husband who absolutely loves golf! Plus I thought it would be cute and fun. Overall the product is what I thought it would be and he thinks it's great. My only problem, if you even would call it that, is the display is hard to read. You know the triangle thing that "answers" all your questions, well it is sometimes a little hard to read. It looks great in my husbands "man-cave" and goes well with his other golf stuff. I would recommend it for anyone who has a humorous side and a love for golf.
