 I love this book, especially for working with pre-schoolers who are typically struggling with the concept of sharing - from crayons to toys to snacks. I disagree with some of the other reviews. Rainbow Fish loses friends at first because he is vain, snobbish and rude because he thinks he is the most beautiful fish in the sea (based upon external shiny scales). When he gives away most of his scales, he learns that greater happiness comes from giving and from friendship than from having beautiful possessions (scales). I especially like the large version of the book which makes it easier to share it with groups of kids.
