 I bought this set to use with Thomas the Tank character engines and cars as it is compatible with them and the Thomas the Tank sets were so horribly expensive. I have always found the Melissa & Doug toys to be of high quality and this is no exception. The items in the set, that I looked at, didn't have any markings so a young child would not realize that it was not an authentic Thomas the Tank set. Everything seems to work just fine with the Thomas the Tank engines and cars. I highly recommend this as an alternative to the exorbitantly-priced Thomas the Tank sets
