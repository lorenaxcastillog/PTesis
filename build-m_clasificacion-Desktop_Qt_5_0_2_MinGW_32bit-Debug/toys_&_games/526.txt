 Let me start by saying my son has had this toy for over three years and it is his absolute favorite. Since he's had it so long I can tell you its very durable. We haven't had any problems. This is the one and only toy he has used every single day since we bought it. He uses it for pretty much everything, but especially for cleaning up. He uses it to gather up all of his toys and take them to his bedroom to put away. He also loves to use it to play store. The only problem with this toy: when his friends come over they want to play with it too! Maybe I should get a few more of them! I would highly recommend this toy to anyone!
