 I'm a first time mom, paranoid and always on the lookout for ways my kid can injusre himself. I almost didn't buy this product because of some of the dire warnings other moms posted here on Amazon. My husband ordered it, and our son LOVES it. He began using it at 3 mos and still loves it at 11 mos. He has incredibly strong hands, and he's never pulled any of the plastic pieces onto himself. The velcro used to attach the hanging pieces is incredibly strong; adult strength is required. This is a versitile, well made toy. It's a little tricky to switch from mode to mode, but, overall, the boy likes it, and it seems quite safe after all. Kudos to Fisher Price
