 The tamagotchi is pretty cool because it is very small. It fits in anyones palm. The characters are cool because there are so many and depending on how you care for your tamagotchi is how it will appear. Like if you don't take care of it, it will look ugly. and vice versa. After a week or two after your tamagotchi dies, you become less and less into it. But I've dropped mine so many times, even when my dad stepped on it after I dropped it, it survived. The tamagotchi teaches care though. See? I can't even explain any more about it. Thats how boring it is
