 I purchased this wagon for trips to the nearby park and my kids (ages 4 and 2) and I love it! They both fit very comfortably in it. I like all the different configurations that are possible with the seats. They come in handy when I'm hauling stuff and not just kids. I'm not sure why another reviewer has trouble stearing it--mine turns on a dime. I'm thinking theirs is either defective or the wheels were assembled incorrectly. The wagon seemed a bit pricey, but I expect I'll be able to get lots of use out of this for many years to come
