 I wanted to originally purchase a Tumblin' Tigger for my 2 yr old daughter for christmas. When it was all sold out, I hesitantly looked at the Elmo and Blues Clues characters. As I'm sure the Elmo one would have been great, I believe I made an excellent choice w/Blues Clues. First, when you touch her right paw,it sings the song, "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" which I've read to her a lot. It's fun to hear her try and sing the story as well. It's a catchy tune that isn't annoying. Second, it recites the ABCs when you press her other paw. Blue will stop randomly at a letter, and says something that starts with that letter, and asks the child to help her make that sound. (ie, "C is for Cow, make a cow sound with me".) It's neat b/c she never stops at the same place twice. And last, Blue "dances" and wiggles her tail while she is singing, fun for the kids to interact with. A great toy, I am very happy with my end result as a gift.
