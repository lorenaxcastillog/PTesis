 My son earned this toy by winning a gold medal in his TKD tournament.. We hqad to have it overnighted due to his excitement! When it arrived we charged it and finaly got to take it outside to fly.....well, we took it outside. This is a joke! There is no way with our current laws of physics that this thing can fly. We added the weight stickers to balance teh man, as per the instructions..we charged it every few minutes, as per the instructions...but nothing ever happened except the spiderman would nose dive as soon as it was released....Oh...did I mention the tears from my son? Overall, I would say that this was the worst purchase that I have ever made in my life. We have hidden the spiderman in the attic so it will not bring up any bad memories with my son. Maybe one day he too can get it from the attic and disappoint his children.. Buyer .. beware
