 We bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also amazing). There are monkeys, tigers, butterflies, and numerous other jungle animals. I had to look up several of the animals as I was not sure of what they were. This was a good educational experience for both me and my son. This puzzle is durable as are all of the M&D floor puzzles. It has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child. I have had this puzzle for over a year, and it looks great. I rotate this puzzle with the other Melissa and Doug floor puzzzles that we have. I recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids. They are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children
