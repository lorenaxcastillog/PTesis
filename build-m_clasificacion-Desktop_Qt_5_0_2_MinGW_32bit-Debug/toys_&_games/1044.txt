 Puzzle Rack Great in Theory...................The concept of this is awesome, but unfortunately my 18 1/2 month old liked to dump it out with all the puzzles in it and throw it...............As you probably know, at this age most kids dump everything, so I am sure I am not alone here.............some sharp edges, also not appropriate for this age. Like I said, in theory it's great which is why I didn't return it, I just put it away in the closet for a couple of months until I think she can get the concept and no longer dump it..................Still recommend it
