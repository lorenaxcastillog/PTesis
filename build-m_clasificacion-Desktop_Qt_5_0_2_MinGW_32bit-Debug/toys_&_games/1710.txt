 I initially bought this as a toy for work. Playdough is a great fine motor activity and can be used in a variety of ways during therapy sessions for kids of all ages. Of course, it found it's way into my 2 year olds hands and she loves it! Rolling out the dough and pressing out shapes..she could do this for hours. The plunger is a little difficult to use for little hands, and it may cause frustration if there is not and adult there to help. The little scissors are also a big hit and a great way to teach scissor skills. The bucket also keeps everything together. And if the playdough only gets put in the bucket and not their little containers..it still stays fresh
