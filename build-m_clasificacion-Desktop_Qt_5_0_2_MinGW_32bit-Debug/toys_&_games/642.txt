 This is a brightly-colored, sturdy pattern block set. I would give this set to a child between 20 months and 3 years. My 22-month old just loves it. As soon as he saw it (hidden away, intended as a Christmas gift) he kept at me to open it. I finally gave in, and I am so glad that I did. He is at the perfect developmental level for this toy! He tries to match up the shapes and colors, and is even starting to name the shapes on his own. This is such an exciting age! I like how the solid wooden boards are double-sided and VERY sturdy. There are more than enough pieces to go around- even if a few are lost over the years. A few of the pictures arrived with some scratching, but I think this is more annoying for me than it is for my child. Don't forget that these patterning blocks can also be used independantly of the boards. This enables your child to come up with more challenging creations as she or he developes greater skill in this area
