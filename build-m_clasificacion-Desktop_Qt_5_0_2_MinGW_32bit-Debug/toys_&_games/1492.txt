 Me and my husband went and bought a toddler bed a weekago, and bought him the race car bed and he loves it! I Havent really had a problem with him getting out of it or fighting him to go to bed. He likes it much better then the crib. But two days after we got it he fell out of it in the middle of the night, and he did it again while he was taking a nap a few days later. i would suggest you place pillows or something soft on the other side of the bed cause it doent keep him in very well. When my son was sick he tried to sleep in our room but i got him and placed him back in his bed and i got in the bed with him and it really holds up with us both on there. But he likes it and thats the most important thing.
