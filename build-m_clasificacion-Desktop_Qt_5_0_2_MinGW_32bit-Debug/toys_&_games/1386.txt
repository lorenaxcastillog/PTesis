 Okay, so it's not really educational, however, my older kids, who are big SNL fans, have gotten a good sense of the older shows from the game. We've had a blast playing this together. The little game pieces are SNL characters, however, they are mostly recent (Land Shark and Conehead are the only older ones.) The pieces are CUTE though! Really funny. One disappointing thing is that while the DVD plays a portion of a skit, it doesn't play the whole skit. Surely, in a DVD (part of a $40 game!), they could have included entire skits. I like the questions in general, and found the game challenging, but not overwhelmingly challenging. I think it's great for the average SNL fan
