 I've used other looms with pegs at both ends to wrap the yarn around, and those frequently snapped off. So I really like how the base of this loom is one solid piece of wood with notches instead of pegs. Both my 2nd grade son and 1st grade daughter used this loom to supplement their study of ancient Greek/Roman cultures, and were quite pleased with the placemats they made. My son wanted to know why weaving was considered work since it was so much fun! While they have set this loom aside now that spring is here, I think they will still voluntarily choose to use it in the weeks to come. And if not, it still has a lot of potential for rainy/sick days and for making special gifts for doting relatives.
