 I was as pleased as punch to get all the cute little accessories with this 5 pack of Kelly dolls. There are so many included accessories... let me give the full list: 5 pillows, 5 blankies, 5 eyemasks for sleeping, 5 toothbrushes, a tube of toothpaste, bowl of popcorn, plate of cookies, bottle of soda, 2 DVD's (pretend of course), 5 sets of shoes, the pajamas as shown, bag of pretzels, 5 cups, uno game (pretend box), pretend coloring books & crayons, and even a pretend Polly Pocket puzzle! All the girls do come with slippers which will of course be hard to keep on, but hey, at least they included them! This would be an excellent toy to put away until your daughters first sleepover party and then divide the dolls & accessories into little bags to hand out as gifts. One doll has beautiful red hair and freckles.. Irish I suppose. One has very light brown hair and brown eyes, one is blonde with blue eyes, one is Asian, and the final one is African American.
