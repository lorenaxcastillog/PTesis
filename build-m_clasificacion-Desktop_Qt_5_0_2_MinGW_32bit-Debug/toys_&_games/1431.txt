 My son and I worked on this think for a few minutes a day for 9 days. After dealing with countless breakages due to a design flaw (the foundation cannot support the weight fore and aft), we finished. As I picked it up show the Falcon to my son, it fell into three pieces. I tried to repair it and more pieces fell off. The more I tried to repair it, the more it kept falling apart. I am convinced that without the use of model glue, it will never stay together long enough to snap a picture of the completed project. How a child is supposed to play with this is beyond me. It would cause far less trauma (and a lot less money) if you would go and buy your child an equivalent number of Legos and let them use their imagination. We've been loyal Lego purchasers for 12 years now. I will think long and hard before I purchase another set like this one. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this product
