 My 5 year old son has throughly enjoyed this recent addition to his Remote Control collection - it's extremely fast and easy to control. Actually b/c it is so fast and takes a moment to stop we've had to ban from certain areas of the house. I wish I had gotten one for my daughter as she too loves Mater and when we're racing w/the other RC cars, we can't catch Mater! The tow line is OK, needs to be a little sturdier and I wish you could control it by RC, it's manual and the hook, a little flimsy, but otherwise, I would purchase this for any CARS fan or children who like RC vechiles.
