 We learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school. I was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured these little kids! Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size. At first glance, they seem boring. But once you start playing with them, they are so much more. They can be made into all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one can reach, without falling!! When our 'surprise blessing' turned 2, I pulled them out for him. He enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!! In fact, we ALL do!! I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they are MORE than worth it!
