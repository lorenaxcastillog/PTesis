 You can totally see through my tiles. I bought mine a couple of years ago. Model number on box says, 04623. Looks to me like there was a bad batch of them made. When I was younger, I had one that was fine. The game is fun, reasonably priced, and educational for the kids as well. I like it because it doesn't take long to play, and several people can all get a turn within an hour. I have written to Hasbro regarding the tiles. Not sure why I waited 2 years to do so, but hopefully they will make good on this problem.
