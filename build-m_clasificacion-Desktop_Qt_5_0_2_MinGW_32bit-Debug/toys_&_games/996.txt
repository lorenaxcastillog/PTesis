 This is the perfect trike for my two year-old grandson. It is very sturdy and folds up to hang in the garage. It will tip if he gets going too fast and tries to take a sharp corner, but it is also low to the ground and stays upright most of the time. He loves to put rocks and toys in the carrier beneath the seat on the back. One thing that did disappoint me was that the picture shows the trike has a bell on the handelbars. Well, ours didn't have one. Luckily I was the only one disappointed.
