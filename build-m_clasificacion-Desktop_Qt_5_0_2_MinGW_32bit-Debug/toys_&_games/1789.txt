 I got this for my daughter for christmas, I brought it home and she seen it, and she wanted it so bad that I ended up giving it to her right then. She hasn't put him down since. he has 5/6 different lights thru out his body so the whole thing lights up not just the belly. 5 different light shows make for new entertainment often, button to activate is super easy to push. light stays on for 15 and then shuts itself off. If you want it shut off sooner just push button on hand a few times GREAT GIF
