 My son started off with My First LeapPad about 3 years ago. It held his attention as much as anything else...only if he was in the mood. We now have upgraded to the LeapPad Plus Writing and he absolutely loves it. The writing component is a plus as he is now getting the gist of sounding out letters. This is the boost he needed. Downside of this -- you'll need an endless supply of books to keep your child occupied. If your child is like my son, he won't want to rewrite on an activity he feels he's already mastered! He finds the games fun but like anything else, you play to much and know the answers - you want to move on.
