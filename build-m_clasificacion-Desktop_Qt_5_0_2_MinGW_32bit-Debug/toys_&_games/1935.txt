 I played this game when I went to a family reunion. It was simple and fun to plsy. Its compact and I carry it in my purse. My kids love to play it and I like to play it with my kids. There isn't alot of explaining to do, no game board, and not a lot of pieces eather. So the start up is easy. If you know your left from your right you are ready to play. You roll the die and do what it says, play till no one has a chip left but one person, and that person wins the game, its that simple. If you play with adults you can bet with money. When I played it was a dollar a game. And we had ten people playing so who ever won got 10 dollars. We all laughted and enjoyed the time together. If you are looking for a simple, fun, and easy game to play this is it.
