 We played this game when several grandchildren, neices and nephews were visiting my son in Virginia. We had eight players, aged 7 to 60. It was great, rollicking fun for all. We gave some extra help for the younger players who did not always know that the clue word was (for example: Yoko Ono). We played for 2 full days, and then again a few weeks later when everyone was able to be together again. My only complaint about this game is that I can not find any other cards for it. We easily exhausted the clues, and now really don't play because some of know a lot of the answers. How about refill cards?
