 I would recommend this game to any and everyone completely. I would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player. Ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much fun. Most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few. I would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products. Never got tired of the game and like I said I recommend it to everyone. Thanks, B. Wolf West Chester, P
