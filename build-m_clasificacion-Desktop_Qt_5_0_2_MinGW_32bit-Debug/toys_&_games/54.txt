 We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish. That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival. Of course it had to go in with the sharks. So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in. The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom. After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered. So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive. I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish
