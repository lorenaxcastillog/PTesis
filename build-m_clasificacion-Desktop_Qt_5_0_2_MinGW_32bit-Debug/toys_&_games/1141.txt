 I am 6 years old and Razor is my favorite toy. I love his growls! They sound like what I think a real T-Rex would sound like. I like Razor's colors of blue and red. I watch a lot of Discovery channel and have lots of dinosaur books and know that cavepeople and dinosaurs did not exist at the same time and that T-Rexes were probably green or brown or gray, but Mom says artists and writers mix fantasy and real life a lot. It's ok as long as you know the difference. Razor fights Thunder, the Brontosaurus, a lot and Razor always wins. I have the whole collection except for Whip, the Parasaurolophus. I wish every kid had these toys!
