 I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom. Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets. The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees. When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened. They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up. In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand. Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive!
