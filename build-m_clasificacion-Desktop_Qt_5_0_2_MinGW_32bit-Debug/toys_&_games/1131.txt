 I am not a big fan of board games, but my children love them. Both my husband and I along with our children ages 9,11 and 14, had a great time playing. Unlike other games, this one can be played in a short period of time and you don't even really need to use the board if you don't want to. Even though we are a very close knit family, this game gave us a great opportunity to discover some little things that we did not know about each other. The game has a good mix of questions so that younger children can easily play. We had to skip some of the questions to get to more interesting ones. Overall, I would recommend this game.
