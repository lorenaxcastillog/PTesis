 I purchased both of the Mega Bloks Pyrates Ships and have built two other Mega Bloks vessals before, namely the Man-o-War models from the Dragons line and they wer both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a challege try finding them instead. The first thing I noticed when I opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set, almost the entire ship simply snaps together, a ten-year-old could do it. There isn't a lot of rigging like in the Playmobil series that will keep coming undone either. All in all it can be assembled in 30 min to an hour. The finished products are full of detail and Mega Bloks has gotten better at it each time, anyone who follows their Dragons line will know what I mean. I'll post a review of the Phantom next and I caint wait to get the Privateer ship Blue Beard's Avenger it looked massive at Toy Fair. With the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be a hit
