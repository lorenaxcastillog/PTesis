 We absolutely LOVE this game at our house. We all play it, even the boys. We've had it for a year & it's still one of our favorites. It's simply a game where you get to see how others see you. You are given wish cards that might say "Would go snorkling with dolphins". You give it to the person you think would most likely do that. Then after all the cards are passed out into the individual "diaries". You rate each of your wishes from hightest to lowest. The person who gave you the highest wish gets more points than the lowest. Easy to keep score with a little "key" in your diary. The name on this game is American Girl 300 Wishes. It has NOTHING to do with American Girl. Just a marketing ploy I suspect. Doesn't take long to play. I'm buying several to give as gifts this year. Probably best it all players know how to read, however my son plays with our help
