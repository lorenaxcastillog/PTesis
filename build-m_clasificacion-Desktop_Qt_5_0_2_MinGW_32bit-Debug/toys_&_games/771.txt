 My 9 year old son got this for his birthday and he (Ok, we) love it. We crashed it many times (always on grass) learning to fly it and it has taken no damage at all. Being foam, I would not fly it over any hard surfaces or around trees and houses. We fly it at the local park or the school field where we have plenty of room. Once we got used to the controls, we can now fly it for the full 2-3 minute charge non-stop. I'm now looking at other Air Hogs planes for me so we can fly together
