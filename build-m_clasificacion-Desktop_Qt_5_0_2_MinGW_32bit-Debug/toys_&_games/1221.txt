 My friend gave this toy to my one year old for her birthday. It makes the cutest sounds! It's a great idea for a toy, it's three puzzles in one. Even my five year old likes to play with it. My one year old just pushes the cubes to make the sounds but my five year old can do the puzzles. I love the sounds too and don't get tired of hearing them like other toys that have sounds. The only reason I gave it four out of five starts is because we have only had this toy for a few weeks and the paper stickers that are covering the cubes are already starting to peel off. My baby wants to tear them off so I have to keep sticking them back down. I will probably have to use some glue to keep them down. Besides that this is a really cute toy
