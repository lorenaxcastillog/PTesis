 This game is truly fun! It is sort of a "I-Spy" type of game with a competitive twist. Three cards are turned and everyone must find the corresponding images on the board, fast. The game board is made up of several inter-locking pieces, which can be re-shuffled to make it hard for anyone to memorize the game board. The game can last 30 seconds, or go one forever if everyone likes it. The younger kids may take longer than the older ones to find the images, but even the young ones can have a great time. My children are 5 and 7 and both enjoy the game tremendously
