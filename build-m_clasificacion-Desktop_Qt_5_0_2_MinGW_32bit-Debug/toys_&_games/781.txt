 My son likes playing with this toy now that he can sit up on the green bench and play with the buttons. When he was younger and not able to sit, we would put him under it and have him kick the bench. When he was able to kick it hard enough to make it play music, the toy would move across the room because there is no traction on the bottom of it to prevent it from moving. This is a great toy for when the kids are able to actually play, but not a good toy to use as a kicker.
