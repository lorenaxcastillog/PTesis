 If you had told me that I would be buying one of these for my little boy (15 months), I would have had a hard time believing it...it's just a table, for water...right!?!? WRONG! Well, it is just a table for water but it is far and beyond that for my son. He loves it!! We keep it on our deck and he will play with it at least an hour at a time. And it's great for those days that are too cool to be in a pool or a sprinkler, but you can still be outside and he can still be playing in water. We love it!
