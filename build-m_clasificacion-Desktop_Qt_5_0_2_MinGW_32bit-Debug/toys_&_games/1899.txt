 I received this game as a present from my wife. However, after a few games, one of the buttons stopped responding, making the game difficult to play. It will be returned to Amazon for an exchange. One note with the game, the make-it-you-take-it style for 24 seconds is odd, but the addition of the 3-point shot is awesome! The game is as good as I remember especially on PRO2. When quiet time is necessary, the sound ON/OFF is terrific. I gave it four stars because the durability seems weak (fifteen minutes of Christmas morning action results in bad button) and the instructions are written poorly. Just a followup, Amazon shipped me a new game even before I had a chance to send the defective one back. Kudos to the Amazon customer service staff for a job well done! I'd give the game five stars, but cannot seem to figure out how to change the rating
