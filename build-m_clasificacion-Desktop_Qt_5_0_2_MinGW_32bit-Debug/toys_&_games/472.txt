 My daughter loves to open and close the microwave, refridgerator door, and oven door. She also likes the sounds this makes. My older daughter had a different model about 5 years ago which she just adored. Both seem really good, although the prior one was a bit better...the door was sturdier and it came with shapes that were "ice cubes" - they would put them in the shape sorter door, then push a button and they would come out. This one, you just place the food shapes in the slots and they fall out. Also, there was a slot for the phone...this model it just comes with the phone, with no real "place" for it. ANYWAYS, all in all, this one is good and she enjoys it (just turned 1). Definitely good buy for 9mos+
