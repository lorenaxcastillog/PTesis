 BUY THIS! We were given the card version of this game as a gift and were so addicted we purchased the board game version which is even more fun (but better for 3+ players). Anyone who visits at our house gets hooked as well. The card game is good for 2 players and makes a good gift at about $15-20, the board game is more like $30-40 but totally worth it. We have also invested in some of the expansion sets and a computer version. Don't let the rules bog you down in the begining, you will enjoy this game!
