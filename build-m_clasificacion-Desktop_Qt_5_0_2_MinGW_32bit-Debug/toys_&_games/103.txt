 Here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e., K - 3rd). Every science kit, including this one, basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and "Voila!" you made a volcano. Nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of Mt. St. Helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products. Use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? You guessed it -- food dye. All these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards. Back in the Middle Ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists. They eventually went out of business. Buy the kid a Suzukie violin or a football helmet instead
