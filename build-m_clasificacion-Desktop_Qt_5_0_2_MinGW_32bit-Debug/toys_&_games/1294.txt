 This pirate set was bought on sale and I would gladly have paid full price for it. I got it for my 8 yr old nephew after the pirate ship (he got that at 6 1/2) and boy, does this get a lot of play. His 5 yr old brother loves, my 4 yr old dauhter loves it and so does the other 8 yr old nephew. It is big enough that all 4 kids can play and interact together. It stays together pretty darn well and compared to the Playmobil stuff (which is like 2 1/2 times more expensive) I think it's better. The plastic is not as thick as the Playmobil but it doesn't need connector pieces to join 2 walls together (the Imaginext has male/female holes for snapping together). Overall, I think this is a great set to go with either the Pirate Ship or even the castles. I even think it is great as a stand alone toy, even if you have no pirates or the other Imaginext sets
