 I have a child who loves to draw, color, and paint millions of pictures and make papers with stuff stuck all over them. So many, that they're everywhere and a lof of them eventually find their way into the trash. This is a great product for this kind of situation. My kid was excited over the large size of the paper. There is enough paper to last a while. You don't have to have an easel to enjoy it. The only dissappointing thing about it was the cost of shipping it - it came in a way-oversized box by itself and made the overall cost to buy it too expensive
