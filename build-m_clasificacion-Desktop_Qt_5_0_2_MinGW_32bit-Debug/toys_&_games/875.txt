 A wonderful toy to take along with your little one since it packs itself into a suitcase by simply folding it up. The only flaw is that there is no slots to keep the crayons in, so they fall out. I am a child of the 70s and enjoyed Fashion Plates, so I was excited to see Disney put a Princess version out. I still have my original Fashion Plates, and will have to dig them out soon because I know my daughter will really enjoy them. This set features the Princess gang and you can change their outfits and color them in. The original Fashion Plates gave you the option to rub patterns into the dresses, and unfortunately this set does not have that option. We plan on using the pattern plates from the original set to decorate the Disney Princess ones. All in all, great fun, and would make a nice gift for any Disney Princess fan
