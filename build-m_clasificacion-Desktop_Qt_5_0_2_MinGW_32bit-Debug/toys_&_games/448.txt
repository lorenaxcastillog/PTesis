 My 2.5 year old Border Collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week. Since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey, I decided to try this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. It's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels, but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still very usable. My ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability
