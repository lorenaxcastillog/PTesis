 I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because I want her introduced to all sports; whether she chooses to go with a specific one years from now it all up to her, but I am doing my part. I cannot speak highly enough about this basketball set. It's GREAT! Even adults can join in with kids in playing with this! I have read more than one review saying that the rim/hoop keeps falling out... my suggestion is MAKE SURE IT'S IN ALL THE WAY! You will hear a click letting you know it's securely in, not to mention you can tell by looking at the back of it. It should be flush against the backboard. I hope that those few reviews won't hinder another parent's choice in purchasing this wonderful and family friendly toy! I give it 5 stars all the way
