 This is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year. If you can find it ANYWHERE I would highly recommend it. It plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback. The microphone is nice for aspiring American Idols (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. We did lose the dancing Cinderella with Prince Charming, but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. It also does a pretty light show. I cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls
