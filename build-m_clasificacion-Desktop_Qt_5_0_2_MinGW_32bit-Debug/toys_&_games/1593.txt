 If you have a little builder in your house, be SURE to buy these! I originally bought the little 20-piece starter set at my local kroger store and boy, were they a hit! The only problem that I can find with these things is that someone out there NEEDS TO DESIGN A CONTAINER for these things! Boy, I've been finding these things everywhere. Other than that, they are just superb. My little one spends hours and hours building things with this set and just cannot wait to get up in the morning to see what else he can make. They're great for preschoolers learning fine motor skills too and not as limiting as Legos can be. I highly recommend these things - my husband loves playing with them as much as my little one does. Boy, the things they can build with these things! Ferris wheels, garbage trucks, towers, geometric shapes, etc., etc., etc. Great, great toy - we're buying more! Oh, as far as that container thing is concerned, we put ours in a coffee can. They stick to the sides and don't fall out! Great Toy
