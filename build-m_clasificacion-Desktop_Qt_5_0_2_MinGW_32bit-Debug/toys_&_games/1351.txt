 We just recently purchased this for our 3 year old twin boys. They have tons of the rescue heroes and we just got them the police car, ambulance, dune buggy, and fire truck for Christmas. I had a hard time finding this item in stores but knew we had to purchase this after purchasing the Rescue Heroes DVD where you actually saw the heroes using the M.A.C.C. We bought this a couple days ago and they have played with it non-stop and drag it to the tv so they can play with their heroes right along with video. It is very durable the only complaint is the new fire trucks won't fit in the ramp area but the ambulance and police car still do. The mission select heroes are hard to come by but we did find some in our collection that we had purchased in a gargae sale last year. This was a great buy especially since we got it on sale in Toys R US for only $12. This would be a great addition to someones Rescue Hero Collection
