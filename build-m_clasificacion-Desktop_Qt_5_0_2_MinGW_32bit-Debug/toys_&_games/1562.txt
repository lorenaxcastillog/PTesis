 My son is 22 month old and he absolutely loves it. He literally does not want to go to bed and wants to play in the morning as soon as he wakes up. We set his computer and his desk in our office, and now mom, dad, and son play/work in the computers together. He finds it amazing that this "big TV" actually responds to him when he hits the keyboard. Right away he started repeating the words, and became more interested in expanding his vocabulary by watching our every move too. I bought Let's Imagine and Birthday Party. Some of the cds have a choice for Portuguese, which is my first language. He is speaking both English and Portuguese, and the softwares are helping in his language development. He does not stay in front of the computer for too long, as he is very active and needs to be always moving. But he is having a lot of fun for the 10-15 minutes a time he plays with it. I strongly recommend for younger toddlers.
