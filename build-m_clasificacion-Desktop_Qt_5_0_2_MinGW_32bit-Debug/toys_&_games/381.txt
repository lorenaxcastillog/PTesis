 My 11 yr old son got these Moon Shoes at Christmas and he plays with them a lot. He has ADHD and Sensory Integrative Dysfunction, and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused. I don't think he ever expected to bounce very high; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets. When he wants to play with them in the house, I send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods. The downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently. At the rate he's going, he'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy. So if anyone hears of a way to get more bands, please speak up
