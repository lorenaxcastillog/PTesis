 I got this for my son and he did have fun with it, but I spent a lot of time trying to unjam the coins from the mechanism. As an actual coin sorter it stinks. The number of coins (or even the types of coins) that end up in each roll is fairly inconsistent. Also, it comes with a top to keep little fingers out of it, but there is no way to keep the top on, so my son got his finger caught by the rotating coin sorter once and was pretty scared until I could pry his finger out of it. I wouldn't reccomend it
