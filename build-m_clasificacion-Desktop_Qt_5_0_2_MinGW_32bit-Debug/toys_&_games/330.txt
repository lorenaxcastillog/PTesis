 My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations
