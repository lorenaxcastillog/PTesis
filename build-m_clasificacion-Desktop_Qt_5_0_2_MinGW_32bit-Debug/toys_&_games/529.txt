 My daughter adores Dora and has been asking for this toy. She received it for Christmas and is thrilled. I love it because it is a very sturdy toy. The babies are heavy duty plastic and Dora is half plastic, half cloth. My daughter has been sleeping with the Dora. She is enjoying pretending to feed the babies and put them in Dora's carrier. This toy is great for play acting as well as wonderful if you are trying to get your child ready for a little brother or sister, although you might want to educate your child that they won't be able to carry their new sibling around in a carrier like Dora until they are much older
