 Santa bought this (along with one other large gift) as a joint gift for my two oldest daughters ages 6 and 3. They both LOVE it.. I got it when it was on sale for $40 and it came with 3 bonus ponies (so I scored!) They can stay up in their room and play with this for hours, and since they have so many ponies (i believe we are at nearly 40 ponies!) this is a wonderful addition to the two other little pony sets they have. Needless to say, it was happily accepted... and the wand is awsome.. we all tend to play with the wand just to hear the noise. Which is cool, I even get a great deal of enjoyment playing with it with the girls.. ^_^
