 This game has such a wide range of age appropriateness. I started playing it against my parents when I was in my early teens, and we loved it. My younger sister, probably seven or so, was jealous of how much we loved the game and taught herself the rules through observation. Soon she was able to beat the rest of us at our own game! If someone is interested in the kind of logic and systematic deductive approach required to play Mastermind, it can be enjoying by someone of any age. I would recommend this game for people who have grown out of simpler games such as Connect Four. This is a great game for grandparents to play with younger people, because the older person doesn't have to "dumb down" their technique to play a kids game. It exercises your brain without having any overt educational tone. Everyone can benefit from some good Mastermind strategy practice
