 For the price, we got what we paid for. The canopy works well on sunny days. Our 15 month old seems to like it. The cup holders come in handy for sippy cups and bottles. They also work for keys and other miscellaneous things. The canopy assembles in about a couple of minutes when we reassemble it from our minivan. It fits in the back of our minivan and still have room for a stroller and an utility box for storage. We have a late model Sienna. I only have one comment about the initial assembly of the wagon. Like most other fathers, I did not read the instruction as closely as I should. I put one of the washers in the wrong order and I had to disassemble the cap that holds the wheel together. It was a b*&^% to remove. Just read the instructions carefully, otherwise it is a great wagon.
