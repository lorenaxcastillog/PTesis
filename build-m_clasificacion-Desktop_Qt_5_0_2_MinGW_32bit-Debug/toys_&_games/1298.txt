 This is a fun toy. As the title says, AgentTracker is a must-have for under-cover agents. It makes playing secret agent more fun. I work for the CIA. No. Just kidding. You have to be 21. It's not like Cody Banks. I would'nt be telling anyone. This secret handheld tracking device is recommended by the spy club I started. I am a T.M.S.T. Level 1 agent. It works by color and sound. Blue means you are in range,but far away from the suspect. Yellow means you are getting close. Red means super hot-you are super-close. Blue has a low beep,yellow has a medium beep,red has a maximum- volume beep. Stash it in your dad's briefcase,on something you don't want "borrowed",in your little brother's trading card album,or even your dog! I have to go. I think they're onto me.

I'm not behind the controls. //PPS-I'm lost and may not return
