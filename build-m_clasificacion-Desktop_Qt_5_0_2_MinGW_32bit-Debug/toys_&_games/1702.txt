 I have a daughter that will be going into Kindergarten next year. My wife and I bought her a LeapPad and two software modules for it for Christmas last year thinking it would help her get a bit of a head start before starting school. While my daughter doesn't play with this on her own, she likes using this software with me or my wife. It seems like she is introducing us to characters she liked in Cars and all the things they can do in this software. By allowing her to "show us around", she has learned quite a bit from this software. She seems to have fun with it as a kid, and the fact that she is learning is very satisfying for me as a parent. I think LeapPad has done a good job here
