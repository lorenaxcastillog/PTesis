 Moon sand is awesome. Sure, it can be messy. Parents should always supervise their children while playing with it. It's fun for parents too! As for a previous review of a parent who let their child open it and play with it in a public place, my question is why???????? And then made their child leave it there? No wonder the other parents didn't like it. You SHOULD have opened it at home, supervised your child instead of ruining their party and birthday. Over all, Moon Sand is a great toy. I hate mess, but don't mind cleaning up the little mess that is left behind
