 This is a great toy. I gave it to my daughter at 1 year of age- too early. I put it away and tried again when she was almost two. It has lots of neat little things to do. The bears can be played with alone, or in their cars, or in the play center. Lots of switches and knobs and things. She did pound too hard with the play hammer on the shapes that get hammered thru a whole, and fell down and cut her lip, but I can't see how that is Chicco's fault. They really make great toys. Their activity table (not the electronic one - the one with the train, instead, an award winner) is wonderful. This is a great break from Fisher Price toys
