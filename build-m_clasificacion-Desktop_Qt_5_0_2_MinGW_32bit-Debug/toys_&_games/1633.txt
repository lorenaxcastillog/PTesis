 We started out with Magnetix because that brand is readily available at all the major stores. My son played with it a lot and I realized that we needed more parts. I wasn't thrilled with the quality of the Magnetix brand. The small magnets came out of the sticks and the balls became dull very quickly. I was about $40 into it and since most brands are not compatible with each other, I had to decide whether it was practical to start over with a new brand. After reading the reviews I decided on Geomag. We got a huge deal on a 660 piece set which is no longer available. As soon as I opened the set I realized that Magnetix was junk and threw them all away. If you are serious about building a large set then forget Magnetix. Geomag is only slightly more expensive, not enough to worry about. One important note is that my son plays with the balls and sticks much more than the plastic inserts. Get some sets with inserts, but build on it mainly with balls and sticks.
