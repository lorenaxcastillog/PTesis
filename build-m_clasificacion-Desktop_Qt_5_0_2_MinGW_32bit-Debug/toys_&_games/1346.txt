 This game is so much like "Trivial Pursuit", you could use the questions and categories from any of those editions to handicap the game even further. I played with two young adults (under 18) and some of the questions for younger players were completely unknown to them. The best part is that you can only answer one question a turn (right or wrong) so a "Ken Jennings" can't win the game on the first roll of the dice. There aren't enough questions supplied with the game, but as I noted above, any multi-category trivia game questions can be used to keep the game interesting. Overall, an excellent purchase for families that enjoy an evening of trivia
