 Girls love all versions of Bratz. As a mom, I think Bratz dolls look too mature for their presumed ages. The makeup is way over the top and their clothing can only compare to "ladies of the night". The Babyz underware can only be described as thongs. However, finally the Kidz version has improved upon that. The makeup is still strong, but more acceptable. The clothing is closer to what a kid would wear and the overall look is more innocent than other Bratz dolls. If you've also found Bratz dolls to be objectionable (even though I still buy them), the Kidz version is much more acceptable and my 7 y.o. daughter seems to like these better than any other version.
