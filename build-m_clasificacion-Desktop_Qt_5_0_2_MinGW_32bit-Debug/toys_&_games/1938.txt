 He's been voiced by Judd Nelson, replaced Optimus Prime as leader of the Autobots, hated by fans, and called by a variety of names: from Hot Rod, to Rodimus Prime, to Rodimus Major. Through it all though, he still makes one sweet toy that longtime Transformers collectors will have a blast with. Since Hasbro no longer owns the rights to the name Hot Rod, Rodimus is here in all his glory in this Deluxe Classic figure, and he looks sweet. Looking pretty much like the futuristic sports car that debuted in the 1986 animated movie, Rodimus is, as a previous reviewer has already pointed out, surprisingly easy to transform back and forth from vehicle to robot. In robot form, Rodimus looks pretty good as well, albeit a bit bulkier than he ever did on the cartoon, but that's nothing new with Transformer figures though is it? He comes with a missle launcher that actually shoots and is easily put in his hands. All in all, Rodimus is a great Transformers toy that collectors young and old will love, and he deserves a welcome place in any collection
