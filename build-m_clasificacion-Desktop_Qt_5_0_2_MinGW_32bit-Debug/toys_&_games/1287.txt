 Whoever is writing the comments about memory size are wrong about how nuch it holds. It WILL hold about 2 hours of music AT 128kbits and the sound isn't too bad using your own cutom eq setting. If yours isn't, you're converting improperly!. It works fine and has an fm tuner in it besides for holding pretty low quality video. I have 4 different types/brands of mp3 players and there is NO comparison between this and my 80gig ipod but that was 350. I got mine on ebay for 12 bucks new in box which can't be beat. Paying 60 at Walmart or anywhere else is way too much (as there are certainly many other units for that price that don't do video but have at least 512mb if not a gig). Look on Ebay folks! Pet
