 I bought this for my son who is 2 1/2. He loves it. He had to show "peepaw", his grandfather who has a real one. Anytime he's outside he gets it out to ride on. He has several other "ride-on" toys and prefers this one over most of them. He has the Little Tikes Police Car Coupe, and Step 2 Tricycle, the Zip N' zoom car, a radio flyer tricycle and a fisher price quad. The only thing I found is if he leans too much to one side it will tip over. It's pretty sturdy otherwise. Put a little helmet on for safety (just like the adults do on our motorcycycles) and you little one will be just fine
