 I bought this item because I have 2 kids, 3 and 18 mo. My 3 yr old was fine with a kiddie pool, but I was worried about my little one. I figured this table would be good for him to play with water without worrying about him falling in :) My 3 yr old ended up LOVING it as well. I have even used it in my unfinished basement when the weather got too cold for outside use. It's great because you don't have the sand making a mess out of the water portion like on some tables. No complaints on this product - very stable
