 well my 5 year old wanted this doll sooooo bad for christmas. this was the only thing she asked santa for. the commercials for this doll were great. i dont know if it is because she is missing her front teeth that the doll does not recognise her or if it just dont work period. but my daughter has cried and cried because this doll does not recognise her. i have reset the doll 6 times but it still does not work the way it is supposed to. every time she talks to the doll it says your not my mommy and she goes into tears or it has her to say its name over and over until she does not want to play with it. i am a single mom and i could barely afford to pay 100 dollars for a doll for her.espesially when her expectations for this doll were so high. i wish someone had written on here the truth about this doll before i bought it, then my daughter would not be so dissapointed
