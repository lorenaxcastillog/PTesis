 My son has a few of the DVDs that go with this system but he absolutely LOVES this one. And so do I!. It's a wonderful story with a great lesson for kids to learn. Great animation and the voice of the character fits the character so well. My son is memorizing the story and loves to read along. He also loves the DVD about the little blue train, but this is still his favorite. This DVD is meant to be played with the READ with ME DVD system and the previous reviewer gave this DVD a negative rating but it appears that they don't even own this system to be able to play it back.
