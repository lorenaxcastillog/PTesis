 Brought it for my nephew, he's 2, for Christmas this year. According to my sister, he was thrilled when he set it on the floor and it took off, with him running after it. Good exercise for him. However, my sister was startled when she received the package and heard a vibrating, zooming sound. She didn't know what was in it so she opened it before Christmas and my nephew was so happy he started playing with it. Why don't they package them without the battery inside the toy or have it turned off? It was suppose to be a surprise
