 Looove this toy!!! We would highly recommend it...Our three year old loves playing with it, in addition to it being a fire truck, my son has used his imagination and has made it into a Mail Truck, an Ice Cream Truck, a Bus, and it makes a great tent when we put a sheet over it. It is very flexible and sturdy. I also love the fact when we are finished playing with it, it easily folds up into a compact package and can be put away. It will easily fit into our suitcase and plan to take it when we go visit grandma over vacation!!
