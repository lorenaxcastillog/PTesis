 My 3yr old has watched Cars innumerable times. His favorite part of the movie is Frank chasing McQueen and Mater. This game is it! The pieces are small but more detailed than I expected. Frank in particular is ok. The game itself is again better than I expected (I had very low expectations). You move around the board, tipping (collecting) tractors along the way. You roll a dice to see how far to go, one side of the dice causes Frank to wake up, move to another spot. And he'll chase you back to the start if you're in the way. My 3yr old loves it. The there are numbers on the bottom of the tractors that you're supposed to add up. But thats too much work, we just count how many tractors there are, or just roll the dice and try to wake up Frank... or just play with the pieces
