 My son got this for Christmas this year and he won't stop asking us to play! He's two and very into matching and it only adds to the fun of one of his favorite books (i'm even noticing details from the book that I've read evernight for the past 24 months! Did you know the cover of both Goodnight Moon & Runaway Bunny appear in the room!?) Anyway, it's definitely been a hit. The only negative thing I have to say is that the box has already started to tear- he wants to take it with us EVERYWHERE! Several of the classic games from when we were little are now in tin boxes- I think that's a great idea for toddlers & preschoolers & wish more manufacturers would do that. However, no reason to give any less than five stars
