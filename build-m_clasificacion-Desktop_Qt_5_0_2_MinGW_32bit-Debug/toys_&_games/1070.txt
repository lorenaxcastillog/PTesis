 Like others have mentioned this is not the sturdiest of toys. You MUST place it on a solid level surface, otherwise it wobbles and pieces disconnect/fall apart. From a parents perspective, I am greatly disappointed with the overall quality. This was obviously not well thought out. It was designed to be easily broken down for storage. Unfortunately... too easily, and playing with it is sometimes troublesome, especially when little hands are trying to deal with the small space that the scale of Polly Pocket toys demand. That being said, my daughter loves it and has not stopped playing with it for two days now. For a child that gets bored with a single toy quite easily, that is a ringing endorsement that can not be put fully into words. Best recommendation... if you are going to buy this, wait for a sale
