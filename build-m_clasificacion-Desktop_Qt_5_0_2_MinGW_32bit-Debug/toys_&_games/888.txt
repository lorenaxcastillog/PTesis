 My family enjoyed the Pirates movies so much that we couldnt wait to get this game. Once we started playing it we were very disappointed. It has no excitement in it. We thought it would have clips of the movies but but it doesnt. It is just moving ships around a map and collecting cards as your treasure. It takes a long time to do each turn since you have to put in your coordinates that your ship is on to see if you found any treasure. We played it for 2 hours and still were no where near ending the game. Be prepared for a long game if you buy this product
