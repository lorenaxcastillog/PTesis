 This item is ok . . . maybe it's just me, but we have had some issues with it. It was ok at first (age 1), because my son couldn't reach the pedals, and his feet just kind of dangled. But as he got a little older, he always seemed at a loss with what to do with his feet. (There's nowhere to rest them.) He would try to rest them on the pedals, and inevitably jam them with his foot. Now he can reach the pedals (age 2), but hasn't mastered them yet. But his feet are dragging the ground. I guess I can raise the seat up, but this still won't solve his dangling problem. Secondly, the canopy and cup holder are useless, and our bike doesn't steer particularly straight, even though we have tried to correct this. My sister's son is same age as mine, and she has the same problems. It is very cute, and we always get compliments on it, but is not nearly as functional. Wish I had gotten something else
