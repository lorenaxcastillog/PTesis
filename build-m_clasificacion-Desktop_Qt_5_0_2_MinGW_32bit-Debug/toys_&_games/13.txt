 My daughter received this as a gift & we all found it extremely difficult to use. I was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out & doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out. It was not at all easy for a child to enjoy. There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand & play. It is too advanced & difficult to use for the ages listed. The screen on the monitor was low graphics & poor lighting quality as well. This is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter
