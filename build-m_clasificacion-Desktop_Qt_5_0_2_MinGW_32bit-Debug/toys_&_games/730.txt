 In concept, this is a great toy. In design, however, it has many flaws. The backdrop piece just does not stay attached! (I actually fun-tacked it to the wall behind where Cloud Kingdom sits in my daughter's playroom.) The Clouds pieces, while very pretty, are just not solid enough to hold up. And be sure to make plenty of space for this toy because it takes up 3 feet of room and does not fold away for storage. My 4-year-old does not seem to mind any of this, though. It really does inspire her imaginative play as she flies her pegasi through the sky
