 I bought this for my office. We are a group of sales reps so we get many little desk toys from our vendors but nothing to really use as an outlet for stress. This works perfectly. It's bright and cheery and adds a fun element to the office space. We had a few issues in the beginning with air leaks but after we found them and patched them up, we haven't had any problems. One co-worker, who was out of the office the week Bozo came in, has now "adopted" him and pulled him closer to her cubicle because she thinks it's so funny. It's pretty durable as long as you aren't too rough with it. It probably won't stand up to kicking or jumping on it but hitting it or throwing softer objects at it will not do much to harm it
