 I say that because the paint on these cars chips VERY easily. The Hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package. My son's Matchbox cars, which get tossed into their basket quite regularly, don't seem to chip near as easy as the Cars ones do. Never-the-less, kids don't care. Though, my son (who is only 3-1/2) is wondering why they didn't make a red Ramone or the announcer Cars (Bob and Darryl)?? Also, FOR COLLECTORS, the Sarge and Fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items, but on the back of the Hamm card, they are not shown. I have as of yet see them sold individually on the Supercharged card
