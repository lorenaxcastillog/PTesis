 I'm tired of kids crafts which don't encourage experiment, require you to buy replacement supplies from the company which makes the kit or just make plastic junk. This is one craft which is fun for both kids and parents, has lots of room for experimentation, uses any old paper and the paper you make has so many uses. I also like exposing my kids to traditional crafts and paper making is one of those (also try Alex's weaving looms to expose kids to weaving). And, of course, it allows you to recycle old paper too. Pretty messy but lots of fun
