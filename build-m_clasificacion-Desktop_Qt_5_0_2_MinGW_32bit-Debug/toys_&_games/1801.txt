 I purchased this LeapPad Plus Writing for my son about 18 months ago. It was GREAT for the first year we had it. Then, all of a sudden, the Pen stopped responding. Changed the batteries and it would work for a bit, then stop again. I finally started hunting around for a replacement pen and could not find one for this pad. They have them for the "regular" Leap Pads. Finally, I had to break down and purchase a whole new pad and lo and behold, we've had it for ~1 month and the pen has stopped responding. The concept of the writing is absolutely wonderful, but find a different way to get your child excited about learning to write. We have a Quantum Pad that is about 19 months old and it still works beatifully! Avoid this Leap Pad Plus if you can
