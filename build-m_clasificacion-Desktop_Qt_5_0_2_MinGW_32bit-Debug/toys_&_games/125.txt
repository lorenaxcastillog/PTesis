 I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination. He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play. He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off. Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature). It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game. all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play
