 My 14 mo old son just got his go kart today. He loves it. He loves pushing the button and making it go. He hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet. My 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40 in tall and 35 lbs). She received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only. They have had the best time today playing with the PW go kart. I agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it. (The razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control) We got the Lil Quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she didn't have the big 4-wheeler. Now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts. Thanks Santa for 2 great gifts
