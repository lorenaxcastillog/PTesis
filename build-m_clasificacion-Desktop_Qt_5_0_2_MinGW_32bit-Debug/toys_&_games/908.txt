 We love this game. My girls ages 8 and 6 and I play this game in the evening. They have both been struggling in math, which is not uncommon in girls their ages. We have tried to reduce the gender bias in math skills by providing materials that enhance math understanding in young children, unit blocks, sand and water play and cooking activities. We just couldn't break through the wall. Last Christmas I bought Dino Math Tracks along with other math related games. This was the breakthrough we have needed. Both girls math skills and understanding of math concepts have improved by leaps and bounds
