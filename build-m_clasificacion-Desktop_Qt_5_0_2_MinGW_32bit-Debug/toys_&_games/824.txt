 I can recommend all of the Little Tikes "Rugged Rigz" vehicles. They are large, sturdy and work well. The Little Tikes bulldozer is one of the best, though, and is my son's favorite. It is a tracked bulldozer/loader, with a blade that raises and lowers (the blade locks at three different levels and "flips up" to unload sand/toys that it has scooped up). The tractor makes a series of diesel engine/backing sounds when your child pushes a large red button on the top. These sounds will continue intermittently as long as the child pushes the toy around, but unlike some toys, the sound does not start until they press the button. Your little construction engineer will love this toy
