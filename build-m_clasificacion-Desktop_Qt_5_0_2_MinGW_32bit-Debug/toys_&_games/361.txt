 This is the greatest thing, I was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn. Not only has it lived up to my 3 year old, but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play, it has not torn. It sparks great imagination. All her friends go to school now, this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also. And best of all, we can store it anywhere when we are done, she has even learned to close it up and put it away. I highly recommend this bus to all!!
