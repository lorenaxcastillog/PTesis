 This DVD contains six rounds. The questions are the same everytime you play that round. So once you've played one of the rounds, you know all the answers. For the price, that sux. I expected different random questions every game, not so. I bought this game because it's packaged like it's a rock based game. (Guy with the Les Paul guitar on the front of the box, Lollapalooza sample question on back, and it comes with a Hard Rock Cafe poster which the box for the game has their logo all over it) so I bite. Then the game has questions about country artist Clay Aiken and the rapper 50 Cents. What's up with that? Plus the game's main theme music is C+C Music Factory's "Gonna Make You Sweat". It was still rather enjoyable, except the DVD kept freezing up. So overall, avoid it unless you can find it for five bucks or less!!
