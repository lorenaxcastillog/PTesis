 My daughter loved this doll. We gave it to her for her 2nd birthday and she was so ecstatic when Dora said her name. I agree with a previous review that you do have to update the information quite frequently or Dora will keep repeating the same things over and over. The information did take up a lot of space on my computer, but you will be blown away at the options that come with this doll. She knows your childs name, friends name, favorite: food, color, animal, song. She is also on a timer. She'll say things like "time to get up," "time for a nap," "time to go to bed," etc. It really is cute! Excellent quality too. Comes with everything you need, definetly worth the Money! To me the only downfall was having to update information so often. Which you don't have to, but children change their minds so often, that you will probably have to
