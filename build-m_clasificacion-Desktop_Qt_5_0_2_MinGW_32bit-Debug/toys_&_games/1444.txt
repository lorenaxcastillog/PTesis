 This version of an old fashioned doodle board exceeded my expectations. I purchased it impulsively because our two year old grandson loves both the movie "Cars" and drawing. However,the doodle pad was larger in size than I expected and made an impressive gift presentation. The larger size also makes it easier for him to draw on than he can on smaller doodle pads. The "Cars" movie graphics surrounding it are really cute, and the stylus is also a "Cars" character. It arrived on my doorstep the second day after ordering - regular shipping - in perfect shape. All in all, I think this was my two year old grandson's favorite Christmas gift - certainly it was "a hit" with him
