 I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies. When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together. I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work. So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not. I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well! I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one). Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off! It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great! I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller. I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck
