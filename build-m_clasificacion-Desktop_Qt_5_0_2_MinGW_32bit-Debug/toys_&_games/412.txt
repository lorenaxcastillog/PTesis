 We bought my son a couple of starfighters, the tri-fighter, the AT-RT, and the wheel bike. He loves the starfighters and likes the AT-RT a little. He rarely plays with the wheel bike. I think the starfighters are just simpler, sturdier, and easier to play with. The wheel bike (and to a smaller extent the AT-RT) are more complicated, and thus less fun for a 5-year old. We run around having mock dog-fights with the starfighters, but poor old General Grievous sits in the toy box. Overall, probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff, but not all that fun for the younger guys
