 I bought "Leap and the Lost Dinosaur" for my kindergartner and he absolutely LOVES it. His favorite part is the page at the end which includes several clear plastic pockets in which he inserts the included dinosaur cards to hear how certain dinosaurs might have interacted if they came in contact. I gave my son a snack-size resealable bag to store his cards in so they're less likely to become "extinct"! The folks at LeapPad thoughtfully included a "wild card" that can function as any of the dinosaurs in the collection in case one (or more) of the cards should happen to go missing. I am completely satisfied with this addition to our growing LeapPad library
