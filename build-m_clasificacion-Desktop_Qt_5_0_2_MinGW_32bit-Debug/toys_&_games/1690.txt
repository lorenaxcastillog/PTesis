 I recently gave this doll to my daughter on her 3rd birthday. She fell in love with it. It is light-weight and easier to carry than the Talking Baby Chou Chou. When a button, is pressed on her back she begins to cry and her cheeks begin to glow, at that time your child gets to take the baby's temperature and give it medicine. The cry sounds very realistic, yet is quiet enough not to be annoying. Once the baby has been taken care of she will giggle. Every time the baby giggles my daughter gets a big smile on her face. She also likes the "boo-boo" on her arm. The doll comes with 3 band-aids; however, she usually needs help with them. Overall a good investment for the price
