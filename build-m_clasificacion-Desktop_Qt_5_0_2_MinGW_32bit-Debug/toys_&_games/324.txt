 There are always problems with an any type of bed, even an inflatable one. I am actually 21, but I don't have a credit card so I had to use the kid review instead. This bed is great. Of course there are problems, but they don't outweigh the good that the bed has. It is great to sleep on, you can carry it on trips, you can have it on another bed that is in one place, or on the floor. I do admit, it is somewhat hard to set up, but it is worth the effort, for the sleep is unparralleled. I sleep on it every night and I have had no problems with it at all. I recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress. What is the most important thing of all is this: Is the person you bought it for happy with it
