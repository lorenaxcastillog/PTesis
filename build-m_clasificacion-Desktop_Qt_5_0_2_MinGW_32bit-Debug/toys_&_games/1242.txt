 My son received this set for his eighth birthday. It was frustrating for him, as well as myself, at first as the rods have to really be pushed hard into the balls in order for your creations to not fall apart easily. Afer hours of working with the set we have found it to be truly contagious. He has made some really amazing &quot;buildings&quot; and never wants to dismantel them so the 900+ piece set is very handy to have. I have a hard time seeing the price value in this product. It appears to be a very inexpensive product to manufacture and it sells for a fairly steep price
