 I ASKED MY PARENTS IF I COULD GET A PET HAMSTER, BUT THEY SAID NO. I GOT THESE SO I COULD HAVE HAMSTERS AND POSSIBLY SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE A HAMSTER. I NAMED ALL OF THEM. BEFORE I DID ONE OF MY FRIENDS NAMED THEM. I BROUGHT THEM TO MIDDLE SCHOOL IN MY PURSE. THEY HAVE MAGNETS IN THEM SO THEY STUCK TO MY DESK. EVERYONE WAS ASKING ME FOR THEM. MY FRIENDS SAID THEY WANTED TO COLLECT THEM. THEIR HEADS DONT BOBBLE THAT MUCH, BUT THEY ARE SUPER CUTE. THEIR PLAYSET IS COOL AND IT ONLY COST $8 AT THE STORE. PLEASE GET THESE HAMSTERS. THEY ARE A MAJOR MUST HAVE!!!
