 There is simply no way anyone could like this safe. 1) The drawer cannot take *ANY* weight. Forget about even putting a few coins it it because once you do, it won't open! 2) It eats batteries like a 500lb man eats hamburgers. Literally a full pack of AA batteries every few weeks! The reason is, this thing flashes lights even when nobody is near it or it is not in use. 3) Cheap construction, this thing is engineered to FAIL. Half the time the drawer fails to open, the keypad fails to work, and it flakes out the other half of the time. Avoid this junk at all costs
