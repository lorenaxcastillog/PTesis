 What a HUGE disppointment this item is! Absoultly NOTHING like the original classic I had as a child some 25 years ago. Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves for turning out this junky, cut-rate, knockoff. I am sorry I did not read any reviews before my mother spent $10 on this for her grandsons. My 4-year old nephew first went to use it on Christmas Day and the ball in the pen was faulty so the pen did not work. The meger handful of only round gears are too thin and cheaply made to track correctly. The paper slides all around under the frame. I have nothing good to say about this product
