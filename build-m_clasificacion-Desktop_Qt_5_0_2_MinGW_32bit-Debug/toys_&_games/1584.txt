 We bought this toy for Christmas. We have tried everything suggested to try to get it to work. The handheld can be played, but we havn't been able to get it to display on the tv. I called the tv manufacturer to make sure I,m on the right channel and that the tv is set up properly. Vmigo comes with a small pamphlet on how to use the handheld (this is good). The other four section paper is full of suggestions on how to get it to work with the tv which includes the numbers for 30 different tv manufacturers. Still can't get it to connect to the tv. We connect three different gaming systems to the same tv with out any problems,one at a time that is. It is very frustrating. I have already make sure that the handheld is in full play mode before inserted into docking system
