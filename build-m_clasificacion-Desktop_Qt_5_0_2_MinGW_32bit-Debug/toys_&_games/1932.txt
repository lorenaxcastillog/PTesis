 For my first grandson who's 19 months old, I wanted a wagon that would serve him forever. I made the perfect selection. The extra depth is brilliant. It's all just fun now and goes everywhere. As he grows it will provide many useful purposes. He'll probably use it for hauling wood for the fireplace when he's a grown man. I wish they had had ATV wheels when my son was little. It's so much easier on the adult pulling the cargo! One word to new parents -- "helmet." Don't forget to buy one and use it every time. Our only problem now is getting him to take off the helmet that his parents said he would 'never' wear.
