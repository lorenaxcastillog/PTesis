 I started playing Boulder Dash back in 1996 and since then it has become one of my favourite games. There is no limit to the number of players that can participate in the game. Actually the more that are playing the more fun it is. You DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW the meaning of the words to have fun. What you need is a wild imagination and good skills in bluffing. The game now includes more categories such as dates, initials and movie titles but still the word category I think is the best. If the cards that are provided in the box are finished no problem you can use scrap paper and honestly I have never used the board of the game while playing. Be ready for rounds of loud laughs and why not be ready to enrich your vocabulary with words you will never use anyway!
