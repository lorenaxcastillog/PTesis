 This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways. I liked to idea, but just doesn't work. This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round. The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck". We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store. (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.
