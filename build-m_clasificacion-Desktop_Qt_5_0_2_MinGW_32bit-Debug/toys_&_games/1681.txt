 I've played this game several times with my friends and family... It's a hit every time. The scoring is kept on the TV and while it takes a turn to get used it, but after that it's pretty easy to do. Basically, when someone gets a question right, you hit the up arrow. It's very cool. While the show set doesn't look like the original orange shag carpet 70s set, the one in this game is kinda cool and modern. There's no host, which is nice because my family usually makes fun of hosts in game shows anyway. This version seems to be "cool enough" for everyone. Basically, if you're looking for an exact copy of the original show, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a fun, family-friendly game with modern music and graphics, this will do the trick. We even played it in the back of a car during a road trip. At $20, it's a good value
