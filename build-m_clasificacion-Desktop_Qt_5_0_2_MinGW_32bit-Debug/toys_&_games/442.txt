 When my 3-month old nephew received this for Christmas, my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately started fighting over it. They played with it so much that we decided to buy our own, even though I thought they might be too old for it. Two months later, it is still the hottest toy in our house. The shapes are vibrant colors, rattle, and have rounded edges, making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children. The top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes, and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself. My kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle. They also like to play "catch" by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other. I would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18 month old
