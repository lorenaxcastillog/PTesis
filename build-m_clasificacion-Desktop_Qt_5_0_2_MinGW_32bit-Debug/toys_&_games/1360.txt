 This is a great game. The new box is nice because it's smaller, so it takes up less space. There's a nice money-holder, and little places for pieces and hotels, and even enough room for all of your old pieces and hotels (2 other boards worth). Places to store property cards and everything. The comm. chest kind of cards are a little flimsier, but that's why you use the old ones you have until they wear out. Games aren't supposed to last forever. If you want something that will, don't expect to pay 18 bucks. A haircut costs more than that, and it only lasts a week. Enjoy what it is
