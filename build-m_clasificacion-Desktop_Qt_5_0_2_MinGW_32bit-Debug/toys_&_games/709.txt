 We bought this for our son when he was about 18 months. It only frustrated him that he could not put the blocks together correctly in order to make the animal sounds. So we shelved it. Then at 2 years old, he rediscovered it and loves it! He is so proud that he is able to manipulate the blocks in order to create sound. This is a toy that rewards fine motor skills. And at 2, he is very interested in the various animals & their sounds. This is a very high quality toy and I am surprised at some of the negative reviews here. My son has beaten the heck out of these blocks and they are still working just fine. We love this one so much that we just purchased the similar "Transportation" sound blocks - also by Melissa and Doug. Hope this helps, Jod
