 Bought this for son when he turned 1 year. He was able able to push the button by 1.5 but the steering does not work. We have taken it apart and put it back together thinking that may be the problem and even put oil on the moving parts. It just doesn't seem to turn well. The mechanism for the steering is flimsy at best -a rod with a hook on the end and its quite frustrating for our little boy. It also gets stuck easy in grass which is frustrating for all. I would just wait till they can drive a bigger version. We are looking at purchasing a 12V vehicle now at age 2
