 This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this). I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games. check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play
