 Works well enough once your kid can pedal themselves, although both my kids tipped it plenty of times. The steering bar isn't effective. It has too much give prob from the fact it's designed to collapse. Plus it doesn't actually steer the bike (some fancier models have this option). The pin to lock the handle bars doesn't always stick. There are no brakes on this thing. Good for pushing your kid around when they haven't figured out the concept of pedals. Dangerous if your kid is old enough to ride themself and goes careening down a hill because they can't stop and don't want to use the Fred Flinstone braking method. Not worth the money, imo
