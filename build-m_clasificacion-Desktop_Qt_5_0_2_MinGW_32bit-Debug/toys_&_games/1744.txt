 UPDATE June 2006..still working great! --------------------- OK, updating this for kicks and giggles as of October 2005. We still have the battery and it workds great. You really must follow the instructions. Just wanted to let people know I stand by what I wrote. ------------------------------------------------ We have this battery and it works great. We were very skeptical because of all the bad reviews. However, if you follow the instructions to the T it works great. The initial charge MUST be 18 hours. We did ours 24. You CANNOT run this battery completely dead. Once you see the toy start to lose it's speed where first is really doggy, then you must take the battery out and charge it. Again, it must be charged the entire cycle of 18 hours. We have been following these instructions (which are the manufacturers) and it works great. My son can get about 3 hours if running it nonstop. Which he has done a few times. Don't try to quick charge this because it is not made to do that. Also, you must charge it once every month when it is not being used (i.e, winter months). Again, the instructions per the manufacturer
