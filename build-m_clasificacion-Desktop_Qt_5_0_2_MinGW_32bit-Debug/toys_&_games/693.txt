 Feeling nostalgic and romanticizing the educational value of *classic* toys, I decided to buy this one for my 4 yr old son for Christmas. At the same time, my SIL bought him a "Kid K'Nex Roll and Go Pal." I was dissapointed that she purchased a competing toy so I defiantly broke out the Tinker Toy first. Both of my children were quickly bored. The wood pieces were very stiff and hard to fit together and, well . . . I'm not sure how to describe this but, the various pieces don't make any sense. It's as if someone took a bunch of different shaped objects and threw them into a can. They don't relate together in any meaningful way. I couldn't think of ANYTHING interesting to build and neither could my kids So, we moved onto the K'Nex and the kids have been playing with it ever since. They have made some of the funniest things I've ever seen. As much as I hate to admit it, there are just better toys out there than this one these days
