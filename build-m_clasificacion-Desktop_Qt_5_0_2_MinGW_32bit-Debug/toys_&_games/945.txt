 I agree with the complaints already written about the toy falling apart easily. Also, the sounds are really annoying and they get set off very easily. I was just about to make the batteries "die" when three of the screws became loose and we had to take the toy away until we could fix it. We looked everywhere for a screwdriver w/ a triangle shape to tighten them back into place, but haven't been able to find one. Although my son has been asking frequently if the toolbox is fixed, he really has been having as much fun just using the diecast vehicles by themselves
