 I recently bought this Read With Me DVD System after much hesitation from other reviews. It was on sale at Toy r' Us for $18 so I decided that I would go ahead and try it. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it. To be honest, it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it. The system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and I have a Pioneer DVD player that is over 5 years old. The only thing I would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the DVD control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the Read with Me DVD system. My daughter absolutely loved it! The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more DVD available in stores.
