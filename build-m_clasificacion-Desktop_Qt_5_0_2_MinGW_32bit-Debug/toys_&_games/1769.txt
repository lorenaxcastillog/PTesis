 My two granddaughters have every piece or set of the Loving Family doll house furniture that you have sold. They love them very much, and they are soo cute. I play with them and we all have a ball. The age is not important. One is 8, one 14, and I am 59. If you have an imagination, you can play. One reviewer said not to buy some of the things because the house cannot hold it all and some comes as built ins in the house. But, having all of them gives more variety and you can change rooms more often so you never get tired of one set. We are thrilled with them and I will get every new one that comes out. Amazon has the best variety and it is so easy to get them delivered right to your door. They never make a mistake in the orders, and they are delivered very quickly. I have always wondered why other stores take so long, and Amazon is so expedient. Love Amazon. Thank you very much
