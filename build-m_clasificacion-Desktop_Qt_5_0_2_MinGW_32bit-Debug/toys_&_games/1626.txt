 I bought this Strawberry Shortcake doll for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. When I was a little girl Strawberry Shortcake was very popular. The marketing for the re-unveiling of Strawberry Shortcake has great timing---just when I am having my own children (they get us on the nastalgia). Anyways, the technology on this doll reminds me of the technology that was available when I was growing up in the 1980's, and the interaction doesn't work correctly. The interactive pen doesn't recognize what page I am on half of the time. The page that I think is the most educational, when Strawberry Shortcake is supposed to read a story, is not even programmed. I have tried and retried to make this part work, but it has just been a complete failure. I am pretty disapointed in this doll, however, we opted to keep it because I got an excellent deal on it. I would have rather spent ten dollars more for up-to-date technology that actually works. My recommendation is to wait until next year. Maybe the company will come out with a higher quality doll
