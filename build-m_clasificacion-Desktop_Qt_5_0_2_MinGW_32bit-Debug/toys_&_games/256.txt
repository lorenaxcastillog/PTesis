 My kids love this game. They sit down together and play this game all of the time. The neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and SORRY is the one they choose the most. We do not have video games at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games. Now they come over all of the time just to play board games. I say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games. Sorry is top game in our house
