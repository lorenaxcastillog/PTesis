 My son received this for his birthday today. I had already read enough reviews that influenced my decision NOT to get it for Christmas... and boy were those reviews right on target! This is cheaply made... the gears don't stay on, the paper slips, and it's almost impossible to make a nice drawing, even for a mom, nevermind my 5 & 7 year old. Hasbro MUST go back to the old construction on these! They were a fantastic toy back before Hasbro bought it out. Boo, I'm sad, and I will be sending Hasbro a letter telling them what I think too
