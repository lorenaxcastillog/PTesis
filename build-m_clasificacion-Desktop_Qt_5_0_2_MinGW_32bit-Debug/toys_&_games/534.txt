 This is the best kitchen out there. My kids have had it for about a year now. (4 and 2, a girl and a boy) And they LOVE it. They play with it everyday. We have TONS of kitchen accesories and they all fit. The freezer is one open space, the fridge has one shelf, the stove has one shelf and the pantry has one shelf. So this doubles as your storage too. My husband put it together, no problems. And i must add...the box came very damaged (it's very heavy and i guess the ups guy wasn't happy about that). It ended up that 4 major pieces were badly damaged. I called kidkraft and they sent brand new pieces (the big sides) no questions asked!!! so to top off a great product is a great company.
