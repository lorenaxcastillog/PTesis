 We purchased all of the figures for my daughter for Christmas. Within 2 weeks of her receiving this one, the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off. We replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month. The head does not stay on invisible violet, Syndrome broke in half, Violet's pin fell out of her arm, and Mr. Incredible lost the pin in his leg. My daughter does not play rough with her toys. Just normal play and they fell apart. Also, Helen is supposed to be Elasta girl. Why didn't they make her stretch? Didn't make sense to me
