 I gave the game "Herd Your Horses" to my 9 year old niece. We have played it 3 times since opening it on Christmas Day. All family members who have played it have had a great time. We have played only the first, but found it easy and fun to play. I am glad that I found a board game for the family to enjoy. It was intriguing to know that this game has "three" versions of play, AND we are being educated on "horsey" facts as we read the cards too. Thanks for offering a great game for many ages to enjoy
