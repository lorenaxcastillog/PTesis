 I first saw this item on amazon.com but I didn't know what it was then I bought it for halloween. When I was online looking at stuff I read the discription more carfuly and iI figured out that this was my coustume now I'm going to scare the the pants off my little sitters friend. She HATES Darth Vader and I also have the voice changer and she HATES that also. Tonight is halloween and I will scare little kids. My friend is also Darth Vader, and my other friend is the grim reaper. But back to the subject. I really do like this toy it's alot of fun and it's so cool
