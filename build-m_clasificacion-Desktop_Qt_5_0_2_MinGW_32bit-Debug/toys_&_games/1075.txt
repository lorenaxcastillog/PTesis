 The Doodle gross out monster is a neat little toy that kids, especially young boys are sure to love. It's a kind or crazy looking, horned monster that functions not only as an effective stuffed companion, but also as an interactive toy. There are several hidden surprises on the monster for kids to "dissect". Peel back the hair and you can take out the monsters brain. He also has a "bat in his belfry" up top as well. The brain is attacked to a thick string that is also attached to his pair of eyes. unwind the string from the brain and the eyes dangled out of his head. next open up the monster's belly to reveal his heart and stomach. He also has a hidden skeletal hand. The toy comes with three washable markers that allow kids to draw on their monster and create accents and designs. Throw it in with the wash to clean the marker and start over again. Lots of fun for kids. Not too gross...gross in a humorous way
