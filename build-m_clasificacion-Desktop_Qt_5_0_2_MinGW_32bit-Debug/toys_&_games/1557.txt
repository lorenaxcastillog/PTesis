 I requested this cart for my 2 yr. old last Christmas - it's cute and "goes with" her dolly, but I really wish I'd asked for a more sturdy cart. She likes that the basket separates, but the handle is so flush with the basket, she can only put smaller things in it. I thought it'd be fun that the basket and seat detach, but they are difficult for a child to put back on and she has to ask me to do it. Plus, both of her dollies' legs get caught in the seat so she can't get them out either. Most of the food things are cardboard, which I yes, laminated with packaging tape, and they still did not hold up. The banana, milk and dish are cute, but I don't think they warrent choosing this cart
