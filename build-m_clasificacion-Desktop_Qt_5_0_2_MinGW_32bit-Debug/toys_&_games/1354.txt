 My daughter received this doll for Christmas, and her sister received the blonde version that is not bilingual. They have really enjoyed playing with and interacting with the dolls. We have not found the cloth legs to be a drawback at all, instead find that the dolls are a little more cuddly that way. My girls are 3 and 4 and I also do in home daycare and all of the girls here (as well as my 3 older sons) have periodically picked up these babies to play with them. I would go with 5 stars but the voice quality is sometimes less than perfect
