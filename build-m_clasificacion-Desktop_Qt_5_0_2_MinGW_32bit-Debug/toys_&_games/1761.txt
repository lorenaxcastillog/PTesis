 I have purchased several FurReal toys 3 large, 2 small. They are so realistic they are always the hit of Christmas -or birthday. However, in all three of the larger toys, one arm doesn't work 'quite' right due to children picking them up as kids will pick them up (by the arm). I noticed another reviewer mentioned this as well. The kids were fans of these particular animals (bear, koala and chimp)and they still love them which is why I still buy them! I was able to take advantage of sales but I don't think the reg. $30 price tag is necessary.
