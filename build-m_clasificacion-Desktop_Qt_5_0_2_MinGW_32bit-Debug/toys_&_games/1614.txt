 I purchased this toy for my 3 year old Nephew that lives across the US from me. My brother told me my Nephew loved the toy, it was his favorite birthday gift. My nephew is tall for his age & this toy fit him perfectly. He figured out the locking mechanism very quickly & has not had any problems with it. The toy is very durable, as a matter of fact my Nephew rode down a very large hill on it (on accident). It did not break or even tip over, it kept him completely safe. I highly recommed this toy, His sisters ages 10 months & 5 years old also love it & play on it when allowed. He has become the hit on his bloc
