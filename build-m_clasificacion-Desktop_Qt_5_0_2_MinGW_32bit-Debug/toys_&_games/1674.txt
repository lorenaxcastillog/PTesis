 My daughter recv'd this Ant farm on her 5th B-day. We ordered the ants, unfortunately they came when we were away on vacation. Basically all were dead. I called the company and they resent more ants free of charge. We got our new ants within 2 weeks. I absolutely just love watching them (Maybe more than my kids). I also have a 3 year old. It is so interesting and such a learning experience. They are so maitenance free. I definately recommend this ant farm.. It is interesting and fun. The ants are very social creatures. I also purchased the whole kit. It has many interesting things to learn in it. A
