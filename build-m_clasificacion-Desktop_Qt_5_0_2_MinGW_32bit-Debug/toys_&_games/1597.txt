 This is the third out of four cartridges that my son has. Aside from the freebie that comes with the system, we also have Winnie the Pooh and Finding Nemo. My son reallys seems to enjoy Bob the Builder, although he get easily confused by it sometimes. It usually has to do with the letters parts. I don't normally supervise him while playing (how much trouble can he get into with a video game?) but he invariably ends up calling me to ask for help with the letters sequences, usually on things he should know himself. This is his favorite, but also the hardest one. Finding Nemo is newer, so he hasn't tried all of it yet.
