 My daughter started playing with these toys around 3 months old. They are designed to latch onto anything-car seat, swing, bouncy chair, crib. In the early months she would focus on the contrasting colors. At 4 months she would concentrate on grasping the toys. And, now at 5 months, she's learned to shake the toys and put them in her mouth. She uses them as teething aids and they seem to keep her attention. We take them where ever we go. And since they attatch to everything-I just connect them to the diaper bag strap so they dont take up any extra space in my bag!
