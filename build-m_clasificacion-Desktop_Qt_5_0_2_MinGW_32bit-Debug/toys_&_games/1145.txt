 I bought these cars for my daughter when she was three months old. She is now nine months old and she loves this toy. She loves the wheels, and she especially loves that they can be stacked and that they are a nesting toy. She likes to take them apart and put them back inside eachother. My friends children have had so much fun with this toy that I keep extra on hand for gifts. It is also an inexpensive gift if you like to keep gifts in the house for that unexpected guest or Birthday party. Well worth the price
