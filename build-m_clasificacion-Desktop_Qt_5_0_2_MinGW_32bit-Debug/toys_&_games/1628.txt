 We bought this for our son, and were excited about his first remote control car! However, after a month of playing with it, the gears became stripped and it wouldn't work anymore. We were very disappointed. The intention of this car is wonderful, but when you actually get the car, you realize how poorly crafted it is. I would not recommend this toy to anyone. When you spend money on toys, especially toys from decent toy manufacturers, you expect the quality to be there. I am sure this was tested over a period of time, so I am sure that they knew this car did not provide very high quality.
