 When i saw that Batman legos were out i flipped out. i LOVE lego, and i LOVE batman, it was like the perfect pairing for me. so i had to get the cheapest set since i only had like 5 bucks, and got this one. i normally hate the smaller sets but i was really satisfied with this set for one reason: catwoman. there arent that many female legos, and having catwoman who is one of my personal fav. batman characters available with this cheap set i was really happy. overall i love her bike becuz it never breaks apart. i have wood flooring, so you can imagine how many times i drop my legos while im playing and they break apart. but not her bike which is what i love. i didnt like the dragster however...but still catwoman alone makes the purchase worth it
