 My daughter is 7 and very active. We're constantly looking for new, fun items to put all that energy to good use. Although a little wobbly at first, and requiring thinking minds to figure out how many rubber bands to use per the weight of the child, these are a hilarious romp if your child doesn't mind falling a bit. Our daughter laughed the whole time, got some great bounces and some great wipe outs. Wouldn't recommend for asphalt or other hard surfaces. Best in wide, open spaces with grass and soft landings! Best for 50 lbs and up. Requires a fair amount of coordination and will certainly build on that!
