 Our 3 year old son just loves Hot Wheels cars. This transporter, however, is not one of his favorites. It's easy to see why. The back is difficult to lower, with it being controlled by a very small button on the bottom of the trailer. Who ever thought of this design for a child? It's also very easy for the child to accidentally get his fingers caught in the trailer when lowering it. The cones and barrels are easily lost and the storage of them in the trailer is badly designed. They have a small piece of plastic that "locks" in the barrels or cones which is impossible for a child to figure out. I'd recommend passing on this toy if you have a child in the 3-5 year old range.
