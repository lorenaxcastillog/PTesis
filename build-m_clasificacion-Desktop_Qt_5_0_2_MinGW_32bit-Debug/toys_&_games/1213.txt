 Santa brought these to our little guy this x-mas, and as usual Santa picked good ones! Our son is currently 19 months so we took away the little pieces the firefighters are holding, but kept the hats. Our boy likes to take their hats on and off and put them in and out of his huge (& equally fabulous) electronic Tonka hook & ladder truck. These figures bend, their shoes are permanently on, their clothes are sewn on, and the paint they used for their faces and bodies holds up extremely well to a still teething toddler. We like them so much, we are hoping Santa brings more next year
