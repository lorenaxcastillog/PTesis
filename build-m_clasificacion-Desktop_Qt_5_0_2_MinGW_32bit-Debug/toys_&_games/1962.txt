 I first saw Cookin' Cookies at a homeschool game day attended by ages 1-6. The kids could not get enough of this game! It's a hoot. And now I'm buying one for our family. Fast-paced, fun, no reading required, practices matching skills and following directions, easy for little ones to play but older ones like it too (even adults!). The way it was played was that each child was given a recipe card and a plastic spoon with a suction cup on the end. Cookie cards were put face down in the center of the table and they used the spoons to smack each card (which then stuck to the suction cup) and they looked underneath to see if it was an ingredient from their recipe card. If it's a rotten egg, they had to put back all of the ingredients they'd collected. The first to finish his or her recipe was the winner. But the kids really didn't care who won. They just loved the suction spoons and picking up the cookie cards.
