 My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing. After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine. She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book. Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible. I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it
