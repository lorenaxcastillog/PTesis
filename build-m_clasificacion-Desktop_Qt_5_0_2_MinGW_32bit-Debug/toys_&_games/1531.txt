 The 2006 remake of Zapf's Baby Chou Chou is no Baby Annabell. The hard plastic battery casing on the dolls back is not padded and all four sharp sides stick out, taking up most of the backside of the doll. This makes it very uncomfortable for a child to hold and you can forget the idea of them falling asleep with it. There is a large gap between what little padding there is in the body and leg; making the sewn leg attachment visible through the clothing. The dolls voice is not clear. What was Zapf thinking when they did away with Baby Annabell? I'm sure Corolle stock will go up this Christmas, their Lila is a great doll
