 This is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush. She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself. You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow, with a bean-bag tushie. The headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well. The eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks. We'll see how "Maria" holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she seems pretty durable. What a great purchase!
