 My 8 1/2 year old daughter got this four years ago for Christmas and I can honestly say it has been one of our most used toys! It has been set up all over the house and outside too. Up until last year she would still have sleepovers in it (It's getting a little small for her for that now). But it is still taken out and set up quite often. I usually set it up myself (I am 5'tall, and less than 100 lbs. and it is extremely easy and simple for me to do.) Unlike the previous reviewer, we have never had problems with tearing, it has been amazingly durable. I have an 18 month old now, and he is also loving it. I use just the tunnel with him sometimes, too! We love it so much I am getting one for my two nieces this Christmas. This is one toy you will get a lot of miles out of!
