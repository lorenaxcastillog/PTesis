 I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please. She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one. I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it. As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise. I was very disappointed in its performance too! We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck. Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not
