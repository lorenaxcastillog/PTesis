 Interesting reading the other reviews. I guess if you have a very strict interpretation of what a game is, you may be disappointed that there is no music, beeper, timer, or lights. I think there clearly is a winner in this game, it is my 3 yr old learning word recognition. He knows his alphabet, but this game shows him that all those letters make words. My son gets very excited when he see that he has completed the word. I think this game is an excellent learning tool. I also breathe a sigh of relief when I can find a game or toy these days that does NOT have lights, sounds, and batteries. I do however, have to add one sidenote, and agree with another reviewer.

This definetly is an error and can make things tricky for a little one. However, it is only a couple words
