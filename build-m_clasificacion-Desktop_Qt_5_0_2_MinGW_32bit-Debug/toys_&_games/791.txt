 This is a great game system to pick up and take with you on a trip. I use this on call with an old tv with mono input av jacks. This gaming system has MS. Pac Man, Pole Position, Galaga, Mappy, and Xevious, all classic arcade games. Ms Pac Man is true to the arcade, and has the feel of it as well with this controler. Pole position is the closest I've seen to the arcade version, with the joystick turing as a steering wheel (very neat). Mappy is an interesting game of an mouse trying to nap a cat on the loose in a museum. Galaga is a lot like space invaders, with more difficult ships to blow up, and xevious places you behind the helm of a spaceship flying over land, blowing up enemies (a lot like tiger heli for nintendo). very cool system, great value from around 6-12 dollars. Worth picking up. Much better than some games available today. Four AA batteries, then plug and play, Family friendly!!
