 My son (5 yrs) recieved this for Christmas. The neighborhood girls love to play it with him. We also have sleepovers of 4 extra boys ranging from the age of 3 yrs to 7 years and they ALL loved it. We put a heavy book on each side of the end of the track, like the directions say, and it works great. We also put a pillow in front/behind the door to keep it from moving. These kids have gone so far as to make a cardboard target and place it so they can 'get points' each time it comes Zooooming down and hits it. We get big screams when the cardboard'ring of fire' is used and the car goes thru without hitting it(this comes with the set). This elevator is a great invention. The only thing I would change is the grey piece under the track that holds the end of the track up. It often comes loose and the car will jump off the end straight instead of jumping up. I guess we will tape it until we get more track to add to this baby. Great FUN!
