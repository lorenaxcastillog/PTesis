 This game is a new classic, celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. It came out just as the board game market was being flooded with Trivial Pursuit imitators, and because it was so different, it stood out in the crowd and became a huge hit. It's become something of a cultural icon, being featured in movies (remember that great scene in When Harry Met Sally, where Sally's trying to draw "Baby Talk" and Jess shouts out "Baby Fish Mouth"?) and has become a staple in many game closets. This game is deservedly popular, and will remain popular for many years to come. It's a great housewarming gift to help a newlywed couple or recent college graduate build up their collection of games. Grab one for yourself, while you're at it, if you don't already have one
