 I really enjoyed seeing my 3 children enjoying this toy. All three are under 5 years so this was a perfect fit. As I said, fun for the kids. Putting this together was easier done by common sense than the confusing instructions. This product is made of plastic and semi durable springs. The front end loader is good for my son carrying my daughters toys away from them, but not feasible doing much good when outside. (I mean, thats what tractors are for, playing in the dirt.) The tires are not good for grass, they slip and will not get a grip. It becomes the family pushing toy instead of one driven by chain. I can say it is fun for the children, I give it 5 stars for fun. Will it be around, Durability wise, we will see..
