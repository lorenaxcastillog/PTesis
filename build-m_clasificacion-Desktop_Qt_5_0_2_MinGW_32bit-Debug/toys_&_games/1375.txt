 What a great way to teach little one how to count. Not only does it help with reading comprehension, it helps little one with number recongnition, social skills (Pooh is so polite) and helps with memory. My little one started with the leap frog products we're up to the quantum now and he still likes to get one of the younger books out just cause the stories are so cute and lots of fun. It's a book filled with Pooh, Tigger and all the friends from the 100 acre woods. Learning last a lifetime, so get them started with fun friends from Leap Frog
