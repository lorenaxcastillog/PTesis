 My oldest daughter received this as a gift when she was three. She spent hours playing with all the dolls and all of their outfits. Five years later, my second daughter (who is now 4) pulled them. She loves them too! She spends so much time picking out costumes and dresses. And my 3 year old niece pulls them out every time she comes over. These are much nicer than the ones I had as a kid! No tabs! They stick with sticky tape that is easily replaced if needed. And the book has many different scenes to place the dolls in. Also there is a nice place in the back of the book to store all the pieces. They go in these little drawers and dressers and closets that fold back into the book and then close with velcro. They can get messy when the girls have every single piece spread out on the table, but they sure have fun!
