 We just gave this tricycle to our daughter for her 2nd birthday and she loves it. It is well-made and lots of fun. It is very easy to control the steering with the parent steering bar. She loves to be pushed on her tricycle while her feet freewheel on the pedals. The bell is a hit along with the cargo area where she puts some of her stuffed animals. I do wonder if the tires have enough air in them. They seem a tiny bit soft and there were no instructions about filling them. Also, I question whether the canopy would survive if a strong toddler pulled on it a lot. Our daughter is not very rough with her toys, so I don't see this as a problem. Overall, this is a GREAT first tricycle and I would recommend it to anyone. It is a reasonable price compared to other trikes with adult push bars and a lot of fun for a toddler
