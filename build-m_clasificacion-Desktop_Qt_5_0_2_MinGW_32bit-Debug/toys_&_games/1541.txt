 I HAVE 4 KIDS. THEIR AGES ARE 5, 4, 2 AND 1. ALL OF THEM LOVE TO DRAW AND COLOR BUT THEY JUST CANT SEEM TO KEEP REGULAR MARKERS OFF THE WALLS, THEIR CLOTHES AND THE CARPETS. I SEEN THIS AT THE STORE AND DECIDED I WOULD TRY IT. IT IS THE BEST! ALL OF MY KIDS INCLUDING MY 1 YR OLD CAN USE THESE WITHOUT MAKING A MESS. THESE MARKERS WILL NOT DRAW ON ANYTHING EXCEPT THE SPECIAL CRAYOLA PAPER THAT COMES WITH THE KIT. WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF PAPER YOU CAN EASILY GET A REFILL FROM THE STORE. THIS IS A VERY INEXPENSIVE GIFT THAT KIDS WILL LOVE AND SO WILL YOU
