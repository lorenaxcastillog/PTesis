 If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price, this is not it!! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99!! These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic. Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2. To top it off, this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags. I am sure my daughter doesn't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do. I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality
