 My 10 year old son is the person that received the Star Wars Episode III General Grievous Chase lego toy. He had saved up his allowance to purchase it and we were very pleased with the toy! He was able to follow the directions by himself, it did take quite awhile to put together, but he did it all in one day. He is very pleased with the toy. I was nervous with how expensive it was, but it is a larger toy and it does a few things. It was worth the money and we were very pleased all the way around, including the fact that it arrived before we anticipated it to.
