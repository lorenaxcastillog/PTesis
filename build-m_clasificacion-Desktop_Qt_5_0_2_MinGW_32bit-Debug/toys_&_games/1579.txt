 I got this pesent for Christmas last year. A few days later I started to make it. It took aprox.4 hours to build. It was fun at first then after 2 hours my hands were hurting and I figured out that alot of peices were wrong and I tried to undo them but my hands hurt like heck. So I left it like it was for a few days. Then a few weeks later my brothers friend came over and fixed it for me. He built it all correct. The music wored fine but the motor would not spin the BIG wheel. It also was quite loud. I dont rate this toy for kids under the age of 11. It was reallt hard. The friend of my brothers was 18. LOL
