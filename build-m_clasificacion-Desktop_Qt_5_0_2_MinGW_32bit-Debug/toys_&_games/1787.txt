 My four year old is absolutely enthralled with this toy, as is his 4 month old sister. I bought the wand for the monkey, which I think is the cutest of the GLO E toys, and my kid spends a huge amount of time changing the colors of the monkey from across the room. If you can get this toy for around $15.00, I'd highly recommend it. The monkey is really soft, but beware of getting the monkey's hair caught in the velcro (where the toy opens to house the electrical innards.) Once the hair gets caught, the velcro doesn't want to work very well
