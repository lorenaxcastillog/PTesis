 My parents bought this for my 2.5 year old daughter this year for Christmas, and she LOVES it! My husband put it together in about 45 minutes with a drill.It is not huge so it doesn't take up tons of room. Our Living Room is a good size and it fits nicely in a corner. It has lots of sounds and the little pretend stove and phone are really cute. My daughter loves running in and out of it, shutting her door and the shutters. Two childrens would easily fit in this. I can fit in it as well. I think this will provide hours of imaginitive play. Overall I would rate this an excellent buy
