 I loved it when I purchased it online and it met every expections I had with this slide. Great slide and just as great design BUT when slide is in upright postion and locked it is VERY UNSTABLE and UNSAFE. It can be easily be knoked over even by an infant or it can just easily tip over when child tries to climb it or slide it. You have to physically hold both carrots by your hands to keep it stable while child is trying to play. Just one oversight incidence by the parents, child will get hurt. Since, I do like the product otherwise, I am trying to figure out a way to mount the legs on ground before I can allow this to be used. Please do not buy this unless you have a way to mount the base on the ground somehow.
