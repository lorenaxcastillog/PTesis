 Santa brought the Yorkie to my 6-year-old daughter for Christmas. While it was as cute as could be, it didn't work well. It would rarely kiss, and, as other reviewers have noted, the velcro on the belly wouldn't close. "Santa" returned it to Toys R Us and got a new Yorkie. This one appears to have some modifications, compared to the first one, to facilitate the velcro staying closed. The "new" puppy is a kissing fool!! She works just beautifully and is so much fun. My husband and I enjoy it as much as my daughter does. This is a cute, fun, enjoyable toy for children of all ages. If you get one that doesn't work to your satisfaction, keep trying for another one. It's too much fun to miss
