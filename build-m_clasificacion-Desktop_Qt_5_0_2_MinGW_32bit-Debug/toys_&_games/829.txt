 I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it.
