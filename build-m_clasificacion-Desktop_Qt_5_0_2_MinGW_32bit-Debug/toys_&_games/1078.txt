 The shark reef is very cool looking, has very good instructions and is beautifully constructed. However the three sharks that they give you to put in with the live fish, really crowd the other fish- they didn't look happy. So we took the sharks out and they were happier, but 2 days later the larger fish died. 2 smaller fish remain, but based on what I read about aquariums, smaller aquariums are difficult to maintain because the PH levels can get off easily due to excess food or excess waste produced by the fish. I worry that my son will get disappointed if we keep losing fish..
