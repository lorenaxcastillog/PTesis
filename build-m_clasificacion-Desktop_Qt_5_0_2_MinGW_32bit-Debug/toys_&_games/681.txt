 My son had been asking for some gears for his construction things, legos, k'nex, etc. I had checked with lego education to find their smallest set to be over $100. Theses K'nex ones are great, especially for the price. The case is a little difficult to open, but then again it keeps his sister from opening the box and losing a peice or two. I gave it a four because I wish the set had a few more gears in it, my son's only complaint. I will probably buy some individual gears to add to his set from K'nex Education site. It is well worth the price to teach a kinetic child the concept of gears!!
