 My son was swept away by the description of this game he found in a mail-order catalog. Playing it is less enchanting. The game goes on and on, and those who are not winning are not having a particularly good time. Although Dread Pirate is extremely beautifully made, it is not a favorite. We've had an amazing amount of fun with better games, such as Zendo and Chrononauts, playing game after game. There are certainly much worse games out there than Dread Pirate, but there are also a few that are tremendously better. Buy this game if you are more interested in the quality and feel of the game pieces than in how much fun the rules are
