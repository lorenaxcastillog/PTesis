 We bought this kitchen for our three year old daughter for Christmas. It took a few hours to assemble by myself, but it was worth the time. My daughter LOVES it, and it is much better than the cheap plastic kitchens. The accessories are great. Metal pan, and metal/wooden cooking utensils. You can also buy more accessories for it, which is great for birthdays etc. I love that the food is made of wood, and that they stick together by velcro or magnetic, (not to worry the magnetic parts are too big to be swallowed.) so my daughter can pretend to the food. Its been nearly two months since we bought it and my daughter plays with it almost daily. As far as the 'wobbly' comments, we haven't had that problem, however my daughter is past the age of pulling things over. It might be a problem if my daughter was younger. So far it hasn't been tipped over and has been pretty sturdy. Considering most wood play kitchens cost over 100 dollars, this kitchen is a DEAL! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a child 3 and up.
