 I recently bought this book for my younger sister. She has been struggling in school and these books have been a great help. She loves them so much that our family uses them as an incentive to do better in school. The Smart Guide to Fourth Grade is probably the best book I have seen so far. She had so much fun playing the games like Spelling Stingers that she didn't even realize she was learning. What really amazed me is that after just half an hour with the book my sister was doing fractions! Her teacher hasn't even touched on fractions yet. I know fractions are usually one of the hardest things for children to grasp but she understood it in just a few minutes! The only reason I didn't give the book a five in durability is that the little cartridges that come with the book get lost so easily! I wish leap pad would come out with a storage system for the books and cartridges
