 This pump is so terribly loud that it truly hurts your ears. First, I thought I'd tough it out to get my daughter's kiddie pool inflated. I thought it would take a couple of minutes. But the pump is neither powerful nor quick. I had to give up because me ears really hurt. I could feel the pain in my ears for hours afterwards. Who designs such a thing? This is a real danger to your hearing. Worse than a rock concert! Don't buy this item. I got the High-Output Air Pump - Double Quick III instead. It is a manual pump and gives you a bit of a work-out but in a way that's not a bad thing! It is a fast and quiet pump. A must better alternative.
