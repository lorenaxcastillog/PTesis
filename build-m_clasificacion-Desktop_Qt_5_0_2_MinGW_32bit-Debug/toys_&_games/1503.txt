 I got this for my 4 and 5 1/2 year olds. It's a simple chase game, but after each move you act something out. The acting has nothing to do with the goal of the game. The acting would be fun, but my 4 year old wasn't interested in acting out the card. Instead, he always acted out a plane. My 5 1/2 year old didn't have the refinement in her movement for anyone to guess what she was doing. There are only 6 game pieces, and really no reason they had to be choking hazards. Since they truly are, I have to keep my 1 year old far away. The quality is poor. The cards are flimsy. Maybe 6 or 7 year olds would have the motor skills...but would they have the interest
