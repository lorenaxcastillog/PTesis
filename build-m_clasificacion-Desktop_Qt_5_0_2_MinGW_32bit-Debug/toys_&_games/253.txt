 Don't buy this price increased version. I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model. Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries. The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it. This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue. If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating. While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own. It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control. It's extremely frustrating. For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick
