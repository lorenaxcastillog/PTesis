 Quarto has given our family of 5 (kids ages 13, 11, 7) hours of great play time. It is challenging enough for a Mensa adult and easy enough for our 7-year old to play. Besides warranting all the awards it has received, it looks lovely enough to keep out as an &quot;art&quot; piece in the livingroom... thus luring erstwhile TV viewers. The company that makes this also makes other games that are just as fun and attractive. I considered giving it a 4 for educational value because it doesn't go much farther than develop conceptual thinking/outside-the-box skills (a feat in itself). Scrabble might be more &quot;educational.&quot; But in its category, it's a definite 5
