 As Christmas approaches, I thought I would give the counter argument to all of these wonderful reviews about the Gator. I received the gift for my two boys (aged 3 and 5 at the time)2 years ago. Initially the Gator was great. Apart from major traction issues (it is terrible with any type of moistrue on the grass), the guys loved it, and it worked well. After 3-4 months, it began to fail. The gear box started to slip. The windshield cracked clean off. The seat adjusters lost their screws. And a bunch of other stuff. It is a very fragile toy, and that needs to be taken into account for anyone purchasing this for good, hearty kids that like to have a good time, but can be extremely rough on toys. In general, I am a fan of Peg Perego, so that makes this even a greater dissapointment. At the price, I would look elsewhere
