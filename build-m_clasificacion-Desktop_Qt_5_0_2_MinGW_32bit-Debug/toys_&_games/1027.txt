 I tried to talk my son out of spending his birthday money on this toy but he HAD to have it. I tried on convice him it was made of cheap plastic and would be broken within a day. Well I was wrong and he reminds me I was wrong everytime he plays with it(Daily). This toy is a hit and I like that it has a volume control. I got my finger stuck in the skull trying to remove an ovesized car that got stuck. It didn't hurt because all the pieces are blunt and the kids have never gotten thier finger pinched. The noises it makes did scare my 2 year old at first but now he also loves this toy and helping his big brother play.
