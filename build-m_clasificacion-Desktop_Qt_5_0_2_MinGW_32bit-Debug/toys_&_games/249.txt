 Like many my age, I grew up with Legos. My wife bought this kit for me for Christmas. I was excited. After a couple of days of work, my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger. This kit is poorly designed, and the instructions are not well thought out. First, the "Death Star" is built on a base that you construct of Legos. This base is not very sturdy. The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side. Left alone, the structure would tip over because of the imbalance. Much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections. I don't mean the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break. I mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put together. In the end my wife and I probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together. I love Legos but this kit gets nothing but ill will for me. For lack of a better phrase, this kit sucks
