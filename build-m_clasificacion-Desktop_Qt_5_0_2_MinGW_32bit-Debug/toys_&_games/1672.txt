 First, only one ant arrived alive. We sent off for more and had a total of five living ants. These five were great for about a week then slowly starved to death because they wouldn't come out of the sand tunnels. My seven year old was so disappointed and heart broken when he realized they had all died. It was really hard to even see their tunnels because the instructions say not to move the farm for fear of collapsing the tunnels. Now, we're waiting for spring to gather our own ants. And guess what? The "sand" is starting to mold!!! A total waste of money, thanks Uncle Milton
