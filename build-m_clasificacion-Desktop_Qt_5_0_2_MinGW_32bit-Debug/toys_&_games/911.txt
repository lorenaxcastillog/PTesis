 If you want to expand your train set 5 cars at a time, this pack features Henrietta, who has been discontinued for a long time, and is now only available in this pack. If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas & Friends episodes, Henrietta is Toby's coach. Like Toby, she is old-fashioned and has seen better days. Not many passengers ride in her, but she doesn't mind. She's mainly only used for giving passengers tours of the Sodor farm. If you missed Henrietta a long time ago, then this pack is a MUST HAVE! Don't forget, since Toby is included in this pack, he and Henrietta will make a great team
