 This was given to my daughter in the third grade, and at first she was intimidated by the questions. It starts out challenging you to easy questions, but as they get harder, I can see her try harder too. It gives you several answers to choose from, and praises you when you pick the right one. It gets harder and harder, but kids seem to love it. It's great for long car rides, and isn't very loud and annoying. Has a shut off switch to save battery life. Very fun toy, and extremely educational! I even bought the one that teaches addition for my first grader
