 Each year I buy my daughter a Barbie holiday edition and it sits in her room, boxed until the next one replaces it. This one she so badly wanted to play with and I should have bought one for that purpose at the 14.99 price tag, but...hindsight, etc. The thought of that beautiful gown in her playroom along with all the other naked Barbies, well... This doll is so beautiful and elegant, although I liked the 2005 doll better because it looked more like a Holiday doll dressed in the reds.
