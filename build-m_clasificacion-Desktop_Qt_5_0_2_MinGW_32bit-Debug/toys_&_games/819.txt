 We were so blessed to find this set at Target this past weekend (7/29/06) on clearance for $14.99! So if anyone reads this soon, go check out your local Target toy department end caps. So easy to put together, colorful and lots of room. My son is 22 months and already loves this table. It's only been 3 days, but as of now, we do not find the table wobbly at all. Hubby used a drill to get the screws in nice and tight. My 7 yr. old sat in the chairs and she is 60 pounds. Of course she did this when we weren't looking and immediatly got out of them when we saw her. My point is, even with her in the chair, we didn't see a problem. So all in all, we are extremely pleased with this set so far. For $14.99 I can't complain!
