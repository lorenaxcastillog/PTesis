 Apples to Apples is great fun! We have made multiple purchases of this game. Playing it in groups of widely varying backgrounds can cause fits of laughter or incredulous, aghast looks. We have played this game on 3 continents - N. America, Europe, and Asia. Playing cross culturally and with people whose first language is not English, brings a new perspective. For example, playing with a Japanese Diplomat and his wife we were taken aback by his playing the card "Bombing Pearl Harbor" for a match to "Fabulous". Definitely different strokes for different folks! A family in China had so much fun playing the game that we bought a game set and sent it to them. Like I said - it is great fun
