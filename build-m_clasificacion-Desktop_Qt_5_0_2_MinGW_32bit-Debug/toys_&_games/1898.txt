 My daughter received this as a gift when she turned five. Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend an hour putting it together and figuring out how to play it. And while you're doing that, your child(ren) will be whining about it taking so long. I was doing okay until it came time to put the two stickers on the spinning wheel. The directions for this part were incredibly confusing, and the directions for how to play the game were about the same. I also couldn't believe that I had to put stickers on the die (first time for everything!). That said, once we FINALLY figured it all out, my daughter loves it. I think it's the "secret" aspect of the game she enjoys -- pick three things out of the box without peeking and look for your match to your princess w/o showing anyone else the card to win the game. Still, I had to rate this 2 stars for the poor construction of the game
