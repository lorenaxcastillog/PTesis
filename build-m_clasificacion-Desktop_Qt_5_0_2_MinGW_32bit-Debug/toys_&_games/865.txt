 We got a slightly different version of this flashlight maybe a year ago. The smoke on ours is smoother/less bumpy than the smoke on the one in the picture. My son LOVES this Thomas and pushes him around quite frequently. Unfortunately, he accidentally dropped Thomas a few months after getting him, and now the light doesn't work (the accompanying sound doesn't work either). The wheels still set off a sound effect, but we couldn't figure out how to fix the short even when we took Thomas apart. Still lots of fun, and maybe they've fixed that problem, but I did see that another reviewer mentioned the same thing happening
