 This is a very fun toy. There are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much. After you close the phone, it rings a couple seconds later, and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people. Unfortunately the two I bought quit working within a short time of buying them. I bought the first one last year for my son, and it lasted for about a week. First the recording feature stopped working. Then none of the sounds worked. New batteries didn't help, I even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts. Didn't find any problems...it just refused to work. We bought a second one for Christmas 06, and it's already quit too. We'll try to stay away from this brand
