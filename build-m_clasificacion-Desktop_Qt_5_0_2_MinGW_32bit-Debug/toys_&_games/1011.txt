 This cute little set is not only sturdy and realistic, it was also a wonderful introduction to preparing food for our 3 year old daughter. Ever since her Grandpa bought this for her, she's made everything from a cheese sandwhich to a triple decker salami club! She had so much fun playing with this toy, that she started to become interested in how I prepared meals. She now is very eager to spread peanut butter and jam, layer turkey and cheese and help mix cake batter. Set comes with cute red basket and 13 pieces of sandwich. A very cute gift to give a girl or boy
