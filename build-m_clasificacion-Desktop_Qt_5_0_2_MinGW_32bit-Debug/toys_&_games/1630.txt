 My 18 month old daughter over the past two months really started to love animals. Seeing this item, I just couldn't past up the chance. She loves pulling the animals out of the pages, walking around with them and making the sounds they would make. Hasn't quiet grasped the concept of putting them back where they belong but that's were I come in to try to teach her. I lay out all the pieces and ask her, "Where is the zebra?" If she doesn't know, I'll pick it up and tell her then I put it back into it's rightful slot. Eventually, she'll know all the animals so we'll make a different game out of it. I'm guessing that in several months, she'll know where each animal goes and to put them back so they will fit. I highly recommend this product. I do agree with the previous review about including forest animals instead of the dinos. But it still rates 5 stars for us
