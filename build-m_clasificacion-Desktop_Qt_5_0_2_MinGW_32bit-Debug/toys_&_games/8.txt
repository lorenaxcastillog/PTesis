 This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! ~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN!
