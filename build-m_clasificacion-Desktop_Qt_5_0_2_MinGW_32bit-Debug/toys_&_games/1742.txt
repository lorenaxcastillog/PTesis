 My 2-year-old son got this for his birthday. He loves playing in it and loading it full of his stuffed animals. I think he will enjoy this for a long time. It is easy to fold up and stick behind the couch or some out-of-the-way place. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the material seems like it would be likely to rip if more than 2 or 3 kids were playing with it at the same time. When we have alot of kids come to our house I usually hide the bus! (especially if the children are older than 7 or so). So far the inflatable steering wheel has held up well. I noticed that other reviews complain of the steering wheel deflating or getting holes in it; thus far that hasn't been a problem for us. This is a great toy, especially for the price
