 We bought this Jeep for our daughter's third birthday, after reading all of the reviews here, i was very excited. It was so easy to put together and took me about an hour to assemble due to the many small pieces. My daughter was a little intimidated at first, but after a few minutes, she was zipping around the yard and patio. (still needs some work on the steering part)!! The only two things i would work on, 1. the flower decals for the lights are a little difficult to peel off and the shift is in an inconvient place. Other than that, It's great!!! I would definetly get a second battery so kids can play for longer periods of time. But well worth the small investment!!
