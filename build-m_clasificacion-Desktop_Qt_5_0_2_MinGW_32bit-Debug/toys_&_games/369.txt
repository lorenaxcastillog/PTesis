 I love this playpen!! Durable plastic, can be extended to larger size (or shortened if going someplace that is not as large). Only problem is that my baby loves to "wander." She is not thrilled when Mommy "cages" her up in order to protect her while I make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary. Crib toys can be safely attached on the sides (did that with her Aquarium toy, which she loves and it soothes her). Occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her. I just put her other toys in for her to play with
