 My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships. This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy. The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate. The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures. My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours. The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails. I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles. I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects
