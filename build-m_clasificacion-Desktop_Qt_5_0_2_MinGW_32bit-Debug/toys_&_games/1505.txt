 My daughter has loved this game since she was six years old. The craftsmanship of the game itself is beautiful. The game-pieces and the little trees are wooden, and the illustrations are of the old-fashioned fairytale variety, very intricate and colourful. The cards are good,thick cardboard and will stand up to years of use. It looks like a very old game that one would find in an attic trunk. Winning depends on such a variety of strategy, memory, and just plain luck that a combination of ages can play concurrently and feel equally challenged. I recommend The Enchanged Forest highly. It is a feast of colours, a delight to behold and touch, and it provides good mental exercise.What more could you ask
