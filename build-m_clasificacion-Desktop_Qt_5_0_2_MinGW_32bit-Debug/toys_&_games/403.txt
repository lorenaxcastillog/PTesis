 I purchased this Train Case for my son last Christmas, (age 6). It is very sturdy, with handle. I like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply/easily. Those moms like myself, when your child has finished playing, there is now a place for them to put their trains in. The 'metal' case is a great added bonus, the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case. Next play time, the trains are all in one spot. Thomas, come up with a place like this for the track - I need it
