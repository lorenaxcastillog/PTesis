 I WROTE A REVIEW FOR THIS GAME ON TARGET.COM, BUT I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE MORE NOTE TO MY REVIEW, OR MORESO, THE IMAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THIS AD. LOOK AT THE SCREEN ON THE TV, THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT!!!! WHAT THE GAME LOOKS LIKE. I CONTACTED TARGET.COM TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS FALSE ADVERTISING AND THEY RETURNED MY SHIPPING COST IMMEDIATELY. BUT NONETHELESS, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SCREENSHOT, IT IS FROM THE REAL ARCADE GAME, NOT THE PLUG-N-PLAY YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY. LIKE THE OTHER REVIEW, I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING! GO TO THE BAR AND PLAY THE REAL GAME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, FRUSTRATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, AND THE GAS MONEY TO GO RETURN THE GAME THE NEXT DAY. TRUST ME, YOU WILL
