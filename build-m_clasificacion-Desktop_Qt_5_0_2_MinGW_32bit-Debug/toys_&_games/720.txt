 I purchased the Undercover Detective Activity Kit for my eight year old granddaughter. We combined it with a wig, false teeth, and a few other items in a backpack labeled "Lauren's Field Kit." It was such a huge hit with her and all the kids and adults. The uncles made up a crime scene by stealing something of hers and the aunts all helped her follow the clues. It was amazing and she still thinks it's her favorite gift of all times! We did put the fingerprint powder up for special usage as her little brother and sister aren't ready for that and I think neither was mom!
