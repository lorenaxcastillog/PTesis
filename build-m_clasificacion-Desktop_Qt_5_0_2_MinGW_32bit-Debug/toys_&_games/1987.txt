 I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it. However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake). As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it). Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off. I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back
