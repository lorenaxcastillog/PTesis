 This is one of the most fun games I've every played. There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question. I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions. A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff). We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs. Try it, it is loads of fun. I recommend a group of at least 4 though
