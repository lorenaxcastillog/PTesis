 I love anything that has multifunctions! I saw this aquarium and thought it would be a fun toy that my son would get a ton of use out of. At two weeks I started using it to try and get some work done around the house...it worked!!!! He was perfectly happy looking up at the fish, and to my surprise it wasn't but a few minutes before he was reaching out for them and kicking his feet to make the ball rattle. I am looking forward to him getting bigger and using it as a tunnel. This aqaurim has been a big help in getting my housework done and it keeps him busy and quiet too.
