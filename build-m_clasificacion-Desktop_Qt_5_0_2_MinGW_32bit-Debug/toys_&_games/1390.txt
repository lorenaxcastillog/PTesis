 I bought this toy thinking, "well, it plays music...maybe it will keep my son occupied." He loves it! He spins the tummy wheel over and over again! You may find yourself humming the music at times like I do! There is an on/off switch in the back so you don't wear the battery down, and also 2 volume levels so you can set it to loud or soft. Luke's face lights up every time I bring it out. It doesn't bounce or do tricks, but the tummy lights up and plays music when you spin it, and my 8-month old can play for ever with it! Any child who loves to spin things or play with balls will have a blast with this little elephant...it even sings 2 bedtime songs. The singing voice is very soft and gentle, making it even more appealing. For the price, it is definitely worth purchasing
