 We found the prices on the internet way too high, but our daughter loves the movie, and this is one item she felt she could wait to get (she is 3). Well, we wandered into Walmart, and got it for a LOT less than on here, and she has played with it (the three cars with it she had avoided buying other ways) ever since. Mack can pop off his trailer just like in the movie. For us, one other advantage is that my in-laws have a car hauling business, and Mack looks nearly like thier trucks. They have a part to thier trucks that goes over the cab and right behind that allows 3 more cars to fit on. But, the way the truck works is accurate enough for loading and offloading cars. Anyhow, for our daughter, that is an added bonus that it looks like the trucks she has seen all her life. I definitely recommend the set for those interested. But, I think anything over $25 is too high for the way it is made is all
