 I bought this toy for my 3-year-old daughter who is obsessed with cutting hair. I am happy with the purchase. The inside chamber is easy for my daughter to fill, and she can easily switch the scalp attachments by herself. She occasionally needs my help to attach the person to the base. Right now she is too young to use the press molds for hairbows, mustaches, etc., but as she gets older I think she will enjoy them. My only complaint is that the pink lever/stand does not click firmly into the larger yellow base that holds the accessories. They frequently come apart. A minor problem but annoying nonetheless
