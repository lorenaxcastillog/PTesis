 This is a family favorite. My family and now their families have been playing for about 20 years. The only problem I have had is that we play the game so often, the cards become bent and sticky from all the shuffling and handling required. I wish it were possible to get just replacement cards instead of the whole set as I now have about 16 racks and only enough cards for 4 players. This game teaches young children 6 and older how to arrange their numbers in order. You don't have to be a genius to play and the whole family can get involved. Young children love it because they can be included in the games. Very inexpensive also
