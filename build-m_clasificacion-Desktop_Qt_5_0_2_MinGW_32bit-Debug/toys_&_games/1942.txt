 Ok got this on clearance for 5 dollars at target last christmas, gave it to my daughter for christmas. We had a real aquarium for years that we could not keep clean and our fish always die despite good care, well we get this just as a cheap gift. My daughter goes to walmart and buys a goldfish and sucker fish both way to big for this tank. sure death right? WRONG! Almost a year later... Both fish doing well despite her lack of attention and the little tank stays spottless! Who would of known! We did add a little air pump that blows in tiny bubbles, other than that she feeds them and adds a little water now and then. Little care and the fish are doing great! Well worth it!
