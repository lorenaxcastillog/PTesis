 I bought this for my 4 yr old. He wanted it so bad, but for $[...] I didn't think he would play with it long enough to be worth it. When I found it on amazon for $[...], I decided to get it. He loves it and I have to say it is well made and the pieces are big enough for my 22 mth old to play with too. The only reason I said 4 stars, is that the "porch" part does fall off with a little preassure, but it isn't really an important part of the center. If your little one loves Diego, I would say they would love this toy
