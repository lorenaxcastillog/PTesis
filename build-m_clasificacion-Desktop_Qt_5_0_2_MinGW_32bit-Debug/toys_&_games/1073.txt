 We love the Brio train set, and are in the process of collecting a Brio set for each of our sons birthdays and Christmas'. The wood is soft enough so that a child that is rough with it can toss it around and it may get dented, but doesnt break. The only negative with this particular set is that the plastic scenery pieces dont seem to stand well in the wooden stands. Other than that, we are loyal Brio buyers because you can collect to your hearts content and always know that they will mix and match with the other sets
