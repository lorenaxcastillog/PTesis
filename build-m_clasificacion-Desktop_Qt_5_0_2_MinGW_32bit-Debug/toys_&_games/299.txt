 I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present. I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it. We've had it 4 weeks. What a great pool toy! Kids love it! We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine. I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong. It seems to be well built and sturdy. I wouldn't hesitate to get on it. Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case. It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids. Overall great gift idea
