 We haven't had this mobile for long but I think it's great. I love the fact that we can use longer than regular mobiles. The projection is great not too bright or too soft. The lullabies and the classical music is nice. You can the mobile going without any music. After the baby outgrows the mobile you can use as music box and still have the soft toys and projection attached to it. I've had this mobile less than a week; I am keeping the box just in case anything happens, but so far everything is great and my little guy loves to look at it and my 2 year old loves the projection light and music. It takes 4 C batteries.
