 I don't think the original edition of the Game of Life was meant for grade-school age children. Re-vamping the board with familiar Sponge Bob, Squidward, Mr. Crabs and Patrick makes it an inviting game! Visually, the game board looks great. There are slots on the board to insert the Crusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Sponge Bob's house, etc. The game is a lot of fun and my kids enjoyed it so much. I even enjoyed playing it with them. My only complaint is with the spinner. It is a great looking two-part spinner but when you spin it you have to hold it down. Otherwise it will come apart and/ or come off the board.
