 This is a cute toy with many small accessories not mentioned in the product description. Each doll has a blanket, toothbrush and pillow as well as a mask that coordinates with her pajamas. There are little DVDs and popcorn, cookies, soda, cups (only three cups for five dolls, though). If you have a three year old like I do, the cute accessories will get lost within an hour. These dolls do not have brushes and their hair gets very frizzy quickly. The shoes are mule style and fall right off. It might not be easy to tell the racial variety of the dolls from the picture, but all but one are white, and the other is of ambiguous race. Living in an ethnically diverse community, I found this disappointing. All in all, it is a very cute set with many accessories and it is a very good buy. Be forewarned that is is very heavily packaged and you will spend at least half an hour freeing the dolls and accessories from the box. I would say this would be more accurately for 5+ instead of 3
