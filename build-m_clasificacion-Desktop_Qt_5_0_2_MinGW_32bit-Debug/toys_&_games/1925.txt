 Friends from out of town introduced us to this game, and the time passes so quickly with this game. The instuctions are a little laborious, but once you start playing everyone catches on. It's a strategy game at several levels. The cards have 1) pictures of merchant ships with differing levels of loot (gold pieces) 2) pirate ships at various 'power' levels and 3) pirate admirals (trump card, effectively.) As the game progresses players attempt to capture other players' merchies and maximize gold pieces while trying to prevent their own merchies from being captured. Trust me, it's fun for the family. And of course, everyone can talk like a pirate.
