 Very nice CD Player... My daughter, 14 months old, got this when she was 9 months old. We have been using this player for 5 months, and it works fine. I work it for her though, since she's too young, so maybe that's why it's working fine. Don't know yet! But, it plays music with no problem, and starts with a low volume which is nice for young ears. The jewelry box feature is sooo cute!! Nice little area to put little "girlie" things into. It also has a nice storage area for CD's, and holds a lot of CD's. Overall... this has been a good player, and I hope that it will last many years
