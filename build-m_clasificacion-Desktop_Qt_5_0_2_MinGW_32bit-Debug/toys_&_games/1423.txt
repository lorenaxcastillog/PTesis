 My 2.5 year old son and our 4 year old neighbor played this game for almost thirty minutes tonight. I think that is a long time for young children. Yes it is a teaching tool and needs parent involvement, and no, there are no snazzy sound effects or anything fancy about this game. It is brain work, plain and simple, and good for children. If you are excited the children will follow your example and have a blast! Our children jumped up and down and hugged each other every time they got a word correct and they worked together helping each other find the letters. Competition is fun, but not needed to have a good time and learn. If you want to help your child improve their reading skills or get a jump start on reading, this is a wonderful tool and it is a way to teach children that learning is fun.
