 **If you have NO R/C flight knowledge dont NOT get this get an AirHogs Areo Ace! You will love it and you cant hurt them. Ok this item is a 2ch diffrental thrust r/c plane er.. superman. It will fly, and pretty fast too! Its basicly a delta with two pusher motors, and a Sanyo 120mah Nimh pack, it gets about 5 mins of flight time, the control range is great for a product like this 27mhz not sure of the CH #. It flys fast and range cut out at about 200' Alot of potential for upgrades to real hobby gear.
