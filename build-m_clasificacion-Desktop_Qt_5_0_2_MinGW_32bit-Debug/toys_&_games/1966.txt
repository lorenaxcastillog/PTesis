 This case is definitely GREAT for storing the leappad plus many books and cartridges. It's nice that there are separate pockets for each item. My daughter is only three, so I have to help her put the items in their places in the organizer, but I don't mind...I just love that everything has a "home." For us, the only down side to this organizer is that it is rather large and bulky. It's not a problem at home, but my daughter loves to bring her leappad in the car with her for when we're on the go. We end up taking the leappad and a couple of books+cartridges and throwing them in a bookbag for "in-the-car" use. Especially with her being young, it makes it easier for her to get them out and takes up less space in the back seat that way. I am, however, still very satisfied with the organizer for at-home use
