 The instructions were a little difficult to follow. I put together our son's crib, so it's not like I'm instructionally challenged. ;-) Once it was put together, it seemed very sturdy, but was still pretty easy to move around. I liked that you had to tilt it because this way, my 2 year old can't push the whole thing around his room. I also liked that the bottoms came out of the storage bins so that when you move, etc., you can fold the boxes completely flat. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it isn't bigger. We've got two young children and it seems like no toy box is big enough
