 Well I bought this for my mother-in-law who is hooked on Su Doku. I bought it just as a small token. The price was cheap and I thought why not? Well it is hard to see the screen. It is also a bit impractical in that if you realise that you got a number wrong 20 turns ago, you have to go and delete all the 20 turns you just spent time doing to get to it and amend it. The price was cheap, so I was not expecting anything fancy but to be honest I was disappointed with it. When I realise that I have gotten a number wrong I do not bother trying to find it, I just start a new game. But the fact that is is so hard to see the screen and find the curser is very annoying and in fact no one even bothers using it now. We just print out the sheets from the web and do it the old fashoned way with pen and paper on a clipboard. As I said, no harm done, it was a cheap thing anyhow
