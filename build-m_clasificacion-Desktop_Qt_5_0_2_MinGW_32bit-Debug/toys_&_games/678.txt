 I purchased this coffee maker three years ago. It has been played with by my now 4 year granddaughter and now my 1 1/2 year old grandson is enjoying it also. It has been a very fun set for both the children. It has taken being banged around and taken many falls to the floor but just keeps on working. I have been served many cups of coffee from this set. Recently, I showed the four year old how you could put water in it and it would brew up a pot of coffee, ( something we won't mention to the 1 1/2 old for a while )now it's a whole new toy to her and I now have to really drink all this coffee she makes for me. This is an awesome toy !!! Attractive, realistic and very well made indeed !! Beverly Coutur
