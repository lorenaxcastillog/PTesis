 I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday. After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back. She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game. My daughter has always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin). I suspect this is why she found this game limiting. Other games that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree. My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this. If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine. However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking.
