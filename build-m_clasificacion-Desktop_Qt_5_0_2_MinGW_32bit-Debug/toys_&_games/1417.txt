 We bought this for our son when he was 6 months old, and had just learned to pull up. He LOVES it and a 1.5 months later still climbs all over it. The product has a recall for the ball drop, and they give you a part to stick down there. The probelem was children getting their arm stuck. But when you put the part down their to prevent the arm going in, the balls don't go down! THat is why I gave it 4 stars. We didn't realize it until we put the part in, and it doesn't come. Hubby took it apart, and got it out, our son is to young to get his hand down their anyway. Their are many things to it, and its fun. He loves to play the keyboard. It has rhyming, numbers, letters, opposites, feelings, songs, colors shapes, ect. Have fun
