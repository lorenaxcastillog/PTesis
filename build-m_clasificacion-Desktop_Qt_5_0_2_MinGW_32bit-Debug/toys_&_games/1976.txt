 I would have to say that I agree with most of the reviews that I've read. This is amazingly annoying and lame for parents to listen to and watch... but the kids love it. I have two girls 4 1/2 and 3 and they love it. They come home from ballet class and they have to watch it... over and over again. Well I can get dinner ready without any trouble... but the songs can get to ya. When I got it last year it was only 19.99 not sure how the price doubled this year. Maybe wait till after christmas for a better price or go for the dancing barbie one that seems to be better made
