 We put the Uppercase letters on the fridge when my kid was just over 2. He loved playing with all of the letters--especially M for Mommy, D for Daddy, etc. When we started watching Leap and the Letter Factory (a DVD), he would run to the fridge to get a letter and put it into the unit. At 2 1/2, he could identify all of his capital letters! Lowercase are next. We added the lower case (I think I had to get them from BN). They have a chart in the package which we posted on the fridge . . . he knew the lower case within 2 days. People can't believe that a 3 year old knows his letters and numbers. thank you, Leap Frog!
