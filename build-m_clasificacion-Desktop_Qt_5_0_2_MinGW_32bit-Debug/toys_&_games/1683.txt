 I was excited to get this for my 3-year-old son for Xmas 2005, as he was just starting to get excited about writing and drawing. However, the problems were numerous: --the light was way too dim-we couldn't see the image well enough to trace the pictures --the markers were dry & useless from day 1 --It didn't stay shut. Whenever I tried to pick it up and move it, the latch came undone, and everything exploded out into a big mess in the middle of his floor. This review is written in the past tense, as we no longer store this useless thing in our house
