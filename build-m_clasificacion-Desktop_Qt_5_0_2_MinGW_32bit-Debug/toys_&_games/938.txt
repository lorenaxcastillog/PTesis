 Terrence is probably not made for the track - since he is a tractor and is meant to be used in fields, or for plowing snow. That said, this little guy goes about everywhere in our house and we haven't had any trouble with the tire treads. If your child is prone to pick at such things like mine is, just to see if he can get them off, then I suggest maybe advising otherwise. My little one figured out how to get them off very quickly, but became aggravated that they were not on when he was "plowing the field." So, I put them back on and well, they haven't come off since. Some neat role playing occurs with Terrence. He just opens new doors for working outside of the track and especially with all the new construction guys that have been introduced lately like Alfie and Jack. Terrence has a lot of fun in our house and he comes highly recommended
