 Whether you're 2 or 92 -- you'll have fun playing this game! This is a wonderful family game to play with young children. I first purchased this game when my son was 2 (he's now 7). He still plays with it with his younger brothers. You can have up to four players play with his or her own playing board (which is designed to look like a child's bedroom). Players take turns reaching into a "monster bag" and feeling for pieces of furniture needed for their rooms. If you pull out a monster instead, you can hide it under your board shouting "Go away, monster!" If you get a duplicate piece of furniture, then you may pass it along to someone who doesn't have theirs yet. The first to complete their room with all their furniture wins
