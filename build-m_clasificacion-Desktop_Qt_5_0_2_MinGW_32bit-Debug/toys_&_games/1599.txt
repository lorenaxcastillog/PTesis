 First off, I will address the issue of the choo-choo sound constantly going off. The same thing happened to our puzzle, constantly! I realized that the sound is light-activated... when all of the pieces are put together, the "sensor" goes off because of the darkness. If there are any pieces missing and the lights go off, the same thing happens, because the sound is triggered by light/darkness. Great product - fun and brightly colored. However, the little pegs that serve as the handles to each individual piece may come loose and disattach, posing a choking hazard for the child. Use with parental supervision
