 If you're not sure if your little one will really be "into" these train sets, this one is a great one to try out. It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings, but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set. We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains. However, after he received it, he found out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either! I just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train. However, you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes Brio trains now, and the train separately as well. This train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use Duracell. Energizer only makes it two days in this train but Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks. Other than that, highly recommend this toy
