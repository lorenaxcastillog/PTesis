 While we have several of these wooden puzzles, this appears to be the one they didn't think through. It's a wonderfully constructed book but easily dismantled. My 2 year old can remove all the magnetic pieces but rarely puts them back. And like another reviewer it must be used under complete supervision. Unlike the "noisy" puzzles that my son will not leave alone. They are wonderful toys but this one really should have some improvement to it since the age range is really wrong for it. I love it, don't get me wrong but it does need some re-thinking since it is a product that young children can take apart and with small pieces there is a choking hazard. Or at least a chance that they will get stuffed into little mouths unless properly supervised
