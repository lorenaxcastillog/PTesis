 My 2 year old loves this Doodle Pro. He and his 5 year old brother play with it quite a bit. I like it because I'm not sure if he is left or right handed at this age. The drawing pen is in the middle and can move from side to side making it easy for both left and right handed children to use. Unlike the Basic Doodle Pro, or even the Original Magna Doodle where the pen is on the right(although Magna Doodle does have a long string). The shapes are fun and can create different pictures, like a house, or making a face. We enjoy it and it's a good size for lots of drawing.
