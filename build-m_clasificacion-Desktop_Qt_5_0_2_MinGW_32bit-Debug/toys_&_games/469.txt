 I bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends were busy until X'mas. There were 5 of us and once we started playing, we were all addicted! I have heard from some other friends commented Clue was a boring game, but we all found it fun and challenging! Apart from strict logic thinking, the keys to win were to ask the right question and make a good, well organised notes! Last time we played we had 5 players, so some of us got 4 cards in hand and some got only 3 in hands. That was a bit unfair because the players with 4 cards had more clues in the beginning and so their chances of winning were higher. So we tried in one game to open 3 cards on the table, the game was finished a lot more quickly. But we all found that it was less challenging. Overall, great game!! Train you brain in logic thinking as much as Sudoku and Mastermind
