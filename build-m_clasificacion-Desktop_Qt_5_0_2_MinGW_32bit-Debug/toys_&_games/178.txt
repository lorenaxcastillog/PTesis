 i bought this thinking it was going to be really cool, but it was very boring and stupid. it contains 3 puzzles all of which a 5 yr old can do and the games are the most stupid games ever. the one with the spinner only shows the objects on the puzzle move smaller as you look at it. thats the whole thing. your pupil is just going back to its smaller, regular size and it makes the picture look like it's getting smaller. and the one with the magic cards is rediculous. anyone can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can see the character you chose through. very disapointing. i wish i could have seen the box before i bought it. then i would have seen just how lame this was
