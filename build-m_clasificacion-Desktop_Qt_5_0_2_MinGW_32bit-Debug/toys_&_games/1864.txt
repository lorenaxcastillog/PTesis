 We bought this castle for our 4-year old who liked to play "war" with his sister's dollhouse - something she didn't particularly appreciate. He loves the toy and spent an entire afternoon creating battles the first day he got it. HOWEVER...this requires a long assembly process, although the box doesn't even say "some assembly required". The assembly is very simple, but it just takes awhile. Pre-assembly is highly recommended unless your child is incredibly patient. Beware of the huge number of tiny pieces, too. Don't let your child open the plastic bags before you're ready to use the parts. Based on our son's enjoyment, however, the assembly time is worth it. The toy is sturdy and fun
