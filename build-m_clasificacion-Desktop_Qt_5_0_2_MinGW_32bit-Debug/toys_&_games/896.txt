 I got this doll for my 4 year old for Christmas. she wanted the Hispanic doll because she says it is "the cute one". I think it looks more babylike than the other two. She loves to play with her, especially feeding her food and her bottle. We haven't had an problems with her eating her food and you just need to slightly squeeze the bottle. We bought Pampers preemie diapers and they fit great and are much cheaper. Baby alive also fits into preemie clothes perfectly. I do have a few complaints though...the first time I wiped off her face the paint on her lips came off, her hair looks terrible unless you are far away b/c it is so thin, and she needs some more phrases to say (no she's not in trial mode). Overall, I think that this is definitely the most life like baby doll on the market right now and my daughter thinks she is the best toy ever.
