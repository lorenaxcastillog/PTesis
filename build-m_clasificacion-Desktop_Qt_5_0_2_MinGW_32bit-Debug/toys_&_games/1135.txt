 I had thought of getting wooden food for my sons, and wondered if the cuttable food was overkill. We tend to go with fewer bells and whistles in favor of toys that stimulate the imagination. Before I made up my mind a friend gave us this set. Her own children had outgrown it. Both my 2yo and 5 1/2 yo LOVE it. The cuttable aspect is the greatest feature. They rarely take the food to the toy kitchen or stove, but they can sit and cut it, put it back together, make mutant veggies (Hmmm, GMO perhaps?), cut them again, make sandwiches, pretend to eat them... for amazing lengths of time. I will be buying this for my niece as a holiday gift as well
