 I am the reigning Queen of Yahtzee in our home! We often play this game as a family and think it is alot of fun. Our young son has developed better counting skills because of this game. He is getting advance at planning his game strategy and is now capable at beating his parents on occasion- even at age 6! We enjoy the deluxe edition- the tray keeps the dice contained nicely. We do all sorts of silly "good luck" moves such as blowing on the die, shaking the container a certain way or just plain yelling out the numbers we hope to roll! Each of us has our own style...some more animated than others. My son has come to learn that if he wants Mom to play a game with him, he can always count on me to play Yahtzee. I guess I love the game because it was a game that I had when I was young and played with my siblings. What a classic game
