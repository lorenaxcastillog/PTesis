 This is also my first review ever - but I felt compelled given our enthusiasm over this toy. We gave this set to our son this Christmas - he will be five next month - and he and the whole family LOVE it! The quality is excellent and well worth the higher cost (compared to the more inexpensive plastic runs). So far, my son has wanted me to build the runs, but I know that as his confidence grows with the toy he will take off into building on his own. And getting as many marbles as we can, as quickly as we can, going down the run is just flat out addictive fun! We felt that this was a great set to start with since (as another reviewer said) it comes with both curved and straight rails along with a spiral and a teeter-totter. I'm already looking forward to buying some of the accessory and add-on sets for my son's birthday and other holidays! I'm sure we are going to get years of enjoyment out of this toy. I highly recommend it
