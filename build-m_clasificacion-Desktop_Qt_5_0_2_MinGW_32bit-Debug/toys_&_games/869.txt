 We have only had this for a few days. My six year old who has needed occupational therapy for fine motor skills and has been diaognosed as hyperactive loves it. I feel that it is good for building up the strength in his hands. I installed it in just a few minutes -- most of that time was spent looking for a limb of the right thickness and height in my yard. The first limb I selected was way too thick and put the Twizzler too high. Purchasers may want to take into account the thickness of the limbs they want to use as well as the height. Overall, this is a really a fun activity for my son
