 I bought these for my music lover when he was 4 years old. He loved them so much that he wanted to take them to preschool to share with his friends. His teacher loved them so much she wanted to order some for the class. The kids had a blast playing with them all morning. My boys are now nearly 6 and 3 and these are always guaranteed fun when we play with them. I really like how each person can hold a tube and you can whack them on the floor to play songs together. Yeah, they are a plastic tube, but they are a fun plastic tube that teaches them about music and entertains them
