 Over the years, I have managed to amass a collection of pretty much every version of "Password" ever produced. With the exception of "Super Password," I enjoyed every televised version of the show. The "Password" episode of "The Odd Couple" is one of my all time TV favorites. You may have guessed, I like the game. This DVD version is, for all intent and purpose, just an over-produced variation on the standard home version. Instead of the cards and holders, you get a pair of 3-D looking glasses. Unfortunately, you can easily read the secret password on the screen without the glasses. And, the computer generated host (Charmin' Chuck Harmin) is just about as annoying a host as they could come up with. Endless Games has produced many good home games. DVD games, at least going by this one, do not fit into their business model quite as well. Save yourself some money and get their standard edition "Password" game. It's not as high-tech. But it's a lot more fun
