 I got the FP3 player for my 5 year old granddaughter because I didn't want her to be left out of being able to listen to music (her sister got an Ipod Shuffle). She loves it! The headset is perfect for her, the controls are easy for her to manage and understand. She can listen to the same music as her big sister (age 10). Technology isn't only for preteens or teenagers. Kids are smarter these days and are exposed to more technology than ever. They see their parents, siblings, and grandparents using computers, mobile phones, Ipods, and video games. They like the cool stuff too! They shouldn't be left out. I only have one suggestion. Place a clip on the back of the FP3 player for kids to clip on to their clothing instead of hanging around their neck. It gets in the way when they are dancing because it flops around!
