 I have always liked Little Tykes stuff anyway, and this slide is definitely no exception in quality, durability and enjoyability!!! I have 22 month old twin boys and they love it. They love the slide, the tunnel, the little footholds on either side to climb up and down, and they also love to jump up and down together holding onto the rails on the top! The steering wheel is also fun. They roll all their cars down both slides, even their huge cars (another plus about this slide is that it's wide!!!!) and the long slide is super fast. It's great. Well worth the money. We've only had this thing for a month now, but I think they'll play with this for years
