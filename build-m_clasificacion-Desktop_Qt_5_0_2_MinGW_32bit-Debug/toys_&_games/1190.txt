 This is such a wonderful toy for teaching put and take. The birdhouse and birds are so colorful and there are lots of different textures. There are also several holes in the birdhouse - so there are different ways to move the birds. My daughter LOVES put and take - so I knew this would be a big hit when she got it for her 1st birthday. And it was - she still likes to play with this toy at 19 months. It has a carrying handle, which is good for kids who like to carry things around (as my daughter does). This birdhouse is also great for practicing fine motor skills - pulling the birds out and putting them back in. Opening the door and roof is excellent practice as well! Awesome beginning learning toy
