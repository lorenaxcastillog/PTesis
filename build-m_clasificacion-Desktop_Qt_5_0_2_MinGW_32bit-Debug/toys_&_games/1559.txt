 Obi-Wan comes with a lizard that looks like its wearing a headress. Very cool. It comes with some kind of reins, and a saddle that is built. The lizard, named Boga, is about a foot long. Obi-Wan himself comes with a brown cape and a top similar to Ep.1 Anakin's. Also, this kit comes with 5 lightsabers, 3 blue and 2 green, plus an extra hilt. The lightsabers have to be assembled. Now for Grievous. His cape is red on the inside and gray on the outside, with some kind of black pattern. His body is white and best described as similar to an Ep.1 droid with four arms that only move from side to side. He rides an interesting spidery-looking contraption with four guns.
