 We purchased the Pony Place for our three year old granddaughter for Easter. She spotted it in the Fisher-Price catalogue in March and put it on her birthday list. It wasn't readily available however in the stores at that time. When we saw it just before Easter, we couldn't resist since she had been hoping and hoping for it. When she got it along with the pony playsets, she was so excited. It wasn't long before adults and children realized that this could be a very frustrating toy. None of us, from three to seventy, could keep the riders on their saddles. This was quickly solved by putting clear velcro on the saddles and the riders, I'm hoping fisher-price will make this cheap addition or make the figures so they snap into the saddles firmly. Otherwise, it is a lot of fun to have in addition to the other fisher-price Dora and Diego toys. It can lead to very imaginative play and the grooming aspect is great for toddlers who hate to have their own hair combed
