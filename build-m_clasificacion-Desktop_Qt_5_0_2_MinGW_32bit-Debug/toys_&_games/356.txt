 I am quite fond of this character. Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from. As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity. Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation. Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry. This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book. He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less
