 My daughter is 2 yrs. old, and got this doll for Christmas. It was her favorite of all her toys. She loves that she talks to you, and recognizes her as her mommy, and tells her when she's hungry, etc... I would have given the doll a complete 5 stars except, they could have made her hair stay up a little better, knowing that small children will be wooling her around. Her hair was only put up with clothe bows. When it started to fall down I just put it back up with some hair bands, and now it's fine. Other than that, shes a great little doll that my daughter just loves, and I think any little girl would. If you get it, you may also want to check out the Little Mommy Diaper back w/ accessories by Mattel. I got this to go with my daughters doll, and they go perfect together. My daughter loves them both
