 The toy is fun for about ages 5 and up. My little sisters got it for Christmas and one of them just turned four. She also had a little trouble with the V meaning purple. The pegs do fall out easily for her but the 5 year old understood that you really have to push them in. It is educational in the sense that they can see how the letters represent the colors because that is what starts the word. My 5 year old sister is almost reading and it was good practice for her, especially because she wanted to get out easy by just asking me and I wouldn't answer her. I wanted to buy them refills for the older one's birthday. I work at Toys R Us and I actually found a couple refill packets, just so you know some places do have them
