 I agree with the previous posters, this has to be one of the worst designed toys from Hot Wheels yet! My son just received this for his 4th birthday and every button or feature on it has frustrated him (he's screaming at it as I'm writing this!). He was so excited when he got it, as he lives for anything Hot Wheels. He is determined to get everything to work on the truck but I can tell that he is going to get so frustrated with it that he'll end up breaking it. Save yourself the money and your child the heartbreak, don't buy this toy
