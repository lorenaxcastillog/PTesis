 Yes it's more expensive than the rest. But the quality and overall ease of use is worth every cent. My 4 year old daughter is tall for her age, so the multi positional handle is great. The pram is easy for her to set up and use, also the reclining back rest and foot rest when used as a stroller is easy to manipulate. We have had many people stop us and ask where it came from. It is also easy to fold down and put in the car trunk (my daughter takes it with her when we go shopping). I also purchased a "cheaper" pram, It is headed for the return desk. The basket underneath is worth its price in gold. If your child is into babies, this pram will last many years
