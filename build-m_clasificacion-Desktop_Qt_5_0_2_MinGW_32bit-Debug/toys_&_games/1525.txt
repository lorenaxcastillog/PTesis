 We just got this in the mail, and it went together very well. Took a while to get one as we ordered it right before Christmas. I used their screws and my own screwdriver - the screwdriver that comes with it is small, so I can see where others may have had a problem. Didn't have any screws break, had one strip out, but that was my fault as I tightened it too far. Remember folks, you are dealing with soft wood here, so don't go crazy with your screwdriver. And DO NOT use a screw gun (power drill), you will defintely have problems. My 3 year old is using it right now and loves it. So far has drawn a cat and a dog, and is going to have some trouble separating from it to go to bed. For the money, this is a winner.
