 This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated. Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items & reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart. During assembly notice they do not "click" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom "base" pieces. We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart. PLEASE do not waste your money as we have. Unfortunately we spent approximately $150 on various Imaginext last Christmas. Do not make the same mistake we did. When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong
