 My two year old has been in love with this toy since day one (it's now 4 months later). However, she was holding it today when HER HAIR GOT CAUGHT IN THE GEAR ON HIS FOOT. To my surprise, the toy didn't even shut off as her hair was being wound around the wheels! The toy also wound around a friend's Halloween costume as she was holding it back in October. I thought (foolishly) that I would give it another chance since the costume was organza. Pablo's now in the garbage and my daughter lost about three inches of hair in one spot. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT
