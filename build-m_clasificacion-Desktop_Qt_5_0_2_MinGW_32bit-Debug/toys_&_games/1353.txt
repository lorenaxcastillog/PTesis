 My son has had this toy for about a year and still plays with it. He has the other three R.H. command centers (the older blue tower and the Aquatic Command Center). He loves to use them all in his missions. It took some time to put together but that is to be expected. Luckily, my son had already had most of the Mission Select action figures, truck and police car before getting this center. They are hard to find in stores, but most can still be found on Ebay. Keep that in mind, that this does not include any figures. It keeps him busy and still keeps his attention after all this time. We bought it on sale and it is back on sale so it is worth the price for any Rescue Hero fan. A great addition to this center is the DVD "Rescue Heroes:The Movie" It has all the Mission Select guys in it and this command center is seen so after watching he will play with the M.A.C.C. and act out the missions. This is great for all Rescue Hero fans
