 The Little People Animal Sounds Farm toy is overrated and overpriced. I believe the best toy is the simplest toy that doesn't require too much assembling time. The animal sounds are muffled, e.g., the pig and the cow. These animals don't do much except staying in the same area. In addition, it requires screw driver and batteries. I would rather spend my money in purchasing coloring activity books. I would prefer purchasing a toy that actually enhances my child's developmental skill which I don't believe this toy has. It couldn't keep my two-year-old daughter attention longer than five minutes. For the number of pieces and quality of the product, it should be priced no more than $20. How much does a chip cost anyway?
