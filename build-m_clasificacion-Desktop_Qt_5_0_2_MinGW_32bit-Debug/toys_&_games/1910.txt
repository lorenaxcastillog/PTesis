 This game is for two to four players, and the more the better. There are not too many games you can play with six players. This keeps all ages interested, even my seven year old. We thought he was too young, but HE WON! He seemed to think having the most money was the way to go, and not buying as much with it. It was total pokerface, he was bluffing the whole time making us think he really didn't get the game and he felt the most money would win, but he ended up tricking us and winning. We were all stunned. We had so much fun we actually continued the game with whoever was left in the game. Even as a parent it was challenging to play against the kids. Some games you do for the sake of interaction with your kids, but this one can hold your interest
