 I am a big fan of tike as well and thought that this set would be perfect first train for my daughter who is 22 months and later my baby who is now 5 months... Also before I made the decision of buying this, not only I looked around, but also read the reviews and bought it based on the ratings of this product. Tikes has the reputation of making toys targeted to toddlers, but this thing is boring, DOES come off the rails when making the turn, we have to keep putting it back; you try to put the driver and the train just goes off; and to make it worst it stops after one round, so that when the kids are getting the hang of it and are ready to watch, it has to be started again... The only good thing is that it is portable by just folding it, and that is what I am doing: I am folding it and taking this thing back to where it came from..
