 The LEGO Racers Ferrari 430 Spider was probably THE most popular item among LEGO fans this past Christmas! It was the #1 request from my grandson, and I tried in vain to find it on the shelves at the BIG toy stores and big box stores. Leave it to LEGO to make a quality product that appeals to kids of all ages, but this one especially geared to the 8 YO group (and up). All pieces accounted for, assembly instructions concise and easy to follow, finished product true to the box picture, with a minimum of frustration on the part of my grandson! And, leave it to Amazon.com to actually stock the product they sell, which has not always been my experience on other websites.
