 When the Toys R Us was having a 2-for-1 sale I got 4 LPS yadda yadda yadda. Go to "all my reviews" and see the story. This is about Emily (the dog). She is SOOOOOOOO cute! She has a teeny body and an enormous head with huge, flappy tufty ears. She is great! Her carrying case is very nicely made and decorated, with a fake quilt pattern on it. She has an ID tag labelled "Littlest Pet Shop" on the purse strap. It is not deep enough--she could very easily fall out if you weren't careful. That's okay. This is a great little dog to add to your collection! She is soooooooo cute with her purse! Must-have dog and 4 stars for durability too!!!!!
