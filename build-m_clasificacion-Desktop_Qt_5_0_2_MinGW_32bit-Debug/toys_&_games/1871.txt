 I agree with the person who said it needs a cardboard backing or border. Since the puzzle is so large and it doesn't interlock, the pieces move when my son adds a state which makes him angry--he is not yet 3. I have to hold down the pieces when he adds the states and if I'm not available to help he gets frustrated. In addition, because some of the pieces are so large (oceans and texas) they tend to warp more than Doug and Melissa's other floor puzzles. The puzzle's saving grace is my son has learned all states in a week
