 I purchased this product for my six year old. The first one I received did not work at all (the main fan was borken). Amazon promptly replaced it, and after the initial charging, we were up and running. The run time is very short (about 10 minutes). The hovercraft does not get much lift, nor does it move particularly fast. It has difficulty moving over all but the very smoothest of surfaces. On the second day, my son accidently touched one of the rear fan blades while under power, and it snapped right off. On a separate occasion, we put the hovercraft (dry) on our kitchen counter, and the rubber skirt left a chemical stain that would not come off no matter how hard we tried. Finally, it was removed by a great product called "goof off", but still a slight hint of the stain remains. I would reccomend you save your money and your counter top
