 I agree that the prices are a bit ridiculous for the cars toys, however, you may have to pay a bit more for some of the characters if you want to complete the collection while the toys are still hot items. My son LOVES his Chick car----Chick provides lots of action to the story. I'm just glad I was able to find this car on [...], because I haven't seen it recently in any of the stores in my area. And, sure I could've waited to find it cheaper---but by the time it shows up in our stores, My two year old may not be as interested in playing with it. He now has all the main characters and he can play with his Cars collection for HOURS
