 My 2-year-od daughter is a huge Elmo fan, so this toy has been a big hit with her. Much to my delight it has been very helpful during bath time as well. If my daughter is ever resistant to something in the tub Elmo is a great example. Elmo has often gotten his ears, hair, neck, face, etc. washed first. Once his turn is finished my daughter is anxiously waiting her turn so she can be just like Elmo. Many times she will imitate what I'm doing and give him a bath too. The crayons are great as well, we have so much fun drawing on the sides of our tub. They wash off very easily and won't stain washcloths
