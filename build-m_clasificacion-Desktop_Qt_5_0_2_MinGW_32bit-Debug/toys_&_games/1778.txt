 My 2 year old son LOVES this toy. He has Down Syndrome and the Backyardigans is the only show on TV he will watch (I guess that's a good thing!). Pablo is his favorite character and he owns all the Pablo toys that have been produced thus far, but this one is clearly his favorite. He is now on his third Sing and Spin because he plays with him so much that he wears out the gears. (He also carries it everywhere!) He has no problems operating it and he hugs it and cuddles it all the time, despite the hard body. If you have a Pablo lover out there, definitely give this toy a try
