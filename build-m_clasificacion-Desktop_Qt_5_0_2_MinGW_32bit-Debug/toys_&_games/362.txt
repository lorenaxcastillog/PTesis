 Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt. One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry. She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble. It is also very sturdy. She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break. I would recommend this doll carrier. It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy
