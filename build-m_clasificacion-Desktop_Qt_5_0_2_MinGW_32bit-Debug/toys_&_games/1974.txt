 My kids love this gun, it blows the biggest bubbles Ive ever seen, and lots of them. We took this to the park and every kid there loved catching bubbles, even the older ones..I mean like 12/13 years old. Its easy for me to use, sometimes the wind wasnt strong enough so I just blew them out myself, no problem. The only negatives I have is that the gun is too big for a small child like a 3 year old. My daughter cant push the trigger hard enough to blow on her own and she cant blow hard enough to get bubbles. My five year old can blow and push the trigger by himself but he always spills all of the bubble solution onto the ground because he forgets not to tip the gun. I found it easier to just blow the bubbles and let them catch them. If you want them to play with this independently you may be disappointed, but if youre willing to join in or have an older child to help, it really is a cool toy and very fun. I wish they had this when I was little
