 I got this for my almost 5 year old. She loves it and plays it constantly, even after having it for 2 months. The toy is extremely durable. It's been dropped, left out in a very cold car, sat on, etc. I only have two issues with this toy and they are that 1) it is very loud when not on a cushioned surface and 2) the sticks pictured to the left of Ariel do not stay in the holder at all. We have lost one of them. Other than that, I really like the feature offered and although the sound quality of when you play it yourself is limited, it's great overall
