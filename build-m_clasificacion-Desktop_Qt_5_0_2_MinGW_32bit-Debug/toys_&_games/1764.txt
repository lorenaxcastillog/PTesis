 This game is hard to beat for a busy family. It can be played on multiple levels. My 4-year old and 7-year old can play together with the game modified slightly. The game cards are sturdy enough that they can take a couple in the car and play "I Spy" the classic way passing the card back and forth. As a busy Mom, it is hard to carve out 45 minutes on a given day for say a game of Monopoly. This game can be enjoyed for any length of time. It is great to pull out if you have 15 minutes. So, no excuses! This will be my go-to kid gift next year
