 our 4 year old daughter had to have this for christmas. so we bought it. it was very easy to put together. the instructions were very clear. it only took me about 30 minutes or less to put together. most of the time was spent looking for a piece that i dropped and it had rolled away. we also bought the accessory set. which adds even more fun to the vanity. my daughter loves to style her hair and everybody else's who walks into our house. she loves to make ariel appear in the mirrow. the only downside that i see, they should have used ariels voice from "the little mermaid". i do think my daughter was looking forward to that, but instead we got a different voice all together.
