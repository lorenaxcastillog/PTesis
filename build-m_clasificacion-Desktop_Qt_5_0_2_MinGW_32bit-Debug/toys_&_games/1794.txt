 My son loves this toy. It's bright, durable, it plays lots of songs and it's easy on the batteries (our first set that the toy came with lasted for almost a whole year with frequent use). One key moves Elmo's head back and forth, one key spins Dorothy (the fish) around in her bowl, and the other keys move the whistle-shaped figures up and down. The song book flips for three different levels of fun. The only complaint I have is that the key that spins Dorothy and also the key that moves Elmo's head are too stiff for a baby or even a younger toddler to push by himself. ~for sta
