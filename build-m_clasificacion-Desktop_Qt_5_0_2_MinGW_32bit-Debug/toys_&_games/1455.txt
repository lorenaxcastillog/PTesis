 My son LOVES the Backyardigans and we've now begin to collect all five stuffed animals from Ty (he began with Tasha since he loves hippos!). Tasha is a girlish yellow hippo with a flair for the dramatic. She often plays Lady Tasha of the Manor or a Volcano Princess! Well-stitched and adorable, the Ty version of Tasha has her wearing a non-removable dark orange dress with a flower motif--as well as fabric shoes (also non-removable.) From a distance, the Ty Backyardigans may look like they're made of rough, itchy fabric--but they are not. The fabric is soft and smooth--somewhat like chenille. If your child loves the Backyardigans, enjoys fantasy play (like tea parties or role playing), or perhaps needs a friend to keep him/her company at bedtime--Tasha would make a wonderful present
