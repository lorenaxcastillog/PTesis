 It it not the "coffee" that we are trying to sell to our kids, it is the whole "role playing" idea that our children love so much that we cater to. While I certainly do not want my child to birth children at the tender age of 3 (more like 30!) I do buy her baby dolls and nursery sets because it is her imagination that I love to watch shine through. I think this is an excellant toy for toddlers! Sit back and let your child giggle and have fun while he/she watches the water go through! There is already too much negative in the world and too many critics want to slam long time favorites of children (barbies), but do your job as a parent and watch your children flourish!!!!!!
