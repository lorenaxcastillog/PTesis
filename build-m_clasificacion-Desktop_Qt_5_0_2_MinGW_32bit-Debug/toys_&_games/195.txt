 Santa gave this to our daughter this year. I am thoroughly disappointed with it. We put the batteries in and started it up. After reading the how to part, the graphics are terrible. I had to prompt her to which flower to step on, not that that was necessary. The princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower, it just made a funny sound. The dancers go fast and fuzzy. You can't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps. I even went on the mat and "tried." My daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done. I hope Santa will take this back
