 I ordered the standard "Ungame" and got 3 of the Christian version. It simply has an extra set of cards in the box containing the original "Ungame" version so its actually a bonus and you don't have to use the Christian card set unless you want to do so. It will come in handy at church for the set I'm keeping for my immediate family, but the other 2 recipients of the game as a gift were a little put off I'm sad to have to say. OTHERWISE, this is a great game for getting to know one another and getting people to share things about themselves they wouldn't normally blurt out. It's fun and nobody wins or loses so everybody goes home a winner!! I reccomend it highly
