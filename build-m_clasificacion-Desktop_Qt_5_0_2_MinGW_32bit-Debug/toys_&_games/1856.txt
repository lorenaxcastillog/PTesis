 My daughter was so excited to use this toy with her friend on the first warm day of spring, but was sorely disappointed. It took nearly three hours to fill each individual chamber with air, and by the time I was done, her friend had to go home. If you leave it outside, it gets very grungy and it is a pain to clean all of the grass and dirt and bug carcasses out of the crevices. And since you can't fit in through a regular door without deflating it a bit, ours wound up mostly outdoors. Some chambers leaked and went flat. It was somewhat fun, although I was worried that the kids would roll over too hard and break an arm. It's hard for the younger kids to push around. My older daughter did have fun in it during a raging hurricane, sitting inside with a hose running. Too labor intensive. Looked like a good idea, but in reality was a pain in the neck
