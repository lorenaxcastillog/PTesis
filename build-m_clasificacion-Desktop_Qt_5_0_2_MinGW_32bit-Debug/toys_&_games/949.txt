 This is a wonderful toy. We bought it for our 8 month old who was starting to pull herself up on everything. She loves it and plays with it everyday. It's very well made and is good and sturdy. The only thing I would say negatively is that on hardwood floors it moves quickly so you need to make sure that you're always right by your little one when they decide to take it for a spin. I'm sure once she's fully able to walk that this won't be an issue but for now it's a slight concern. Other than that I would highly recommend this product
