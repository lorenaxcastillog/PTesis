 My husband bought the reef fish for our hot tub and it was fun. So, I purchased it for a friend who loves to fish and just got a hot tub. Instead, he put the fish in his koi pond as an experiment to see if the live fish would follow it. We thought the reef fish would just swim across the pond and run into the wall, but it is well balanced and swim in a nice circles around the pond. At first, the reef fish swam a little too fast for the koi, but they were interested...especially after an hour or so had passed and the batteries started to run low, causing the reef fish pace to slow
