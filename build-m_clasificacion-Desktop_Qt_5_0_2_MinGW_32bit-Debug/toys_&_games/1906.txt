 I've been playing Kismet at my friend's house since childhood, what a great game! They recently taught me an an easy way to spice up the game... and add to the strategy required to WIN! Here it is: Each game sheet has columns for six games. Instead of playing one game at a time, you can play 3X or 6X. Obviously, each is a longer time commitment that the other. Say you're playing Kismet 3X - you play three games all at once. When you're finished, the Game 1 column score remains as is (x 1); multiply the game 2 column score by 2 (x2); and multiply the game 3 column score by 3 (x3). THEN, add those three totals together - this is your Final Score (could be in the range from 1500 - 3000 points or so). The key here is choosing which column to input your different rolls. Obviously, good rolls w/ high scores should fill up your Game 3 column, b/c it's going to end up multiplied by 3. You want to put your poor rolls in the Game 1 column. Try it, it's fun!
