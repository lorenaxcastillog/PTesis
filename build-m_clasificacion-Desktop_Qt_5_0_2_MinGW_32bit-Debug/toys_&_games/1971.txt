 As a teacher and a parent of an eight year old who would like this item (and whose daughter happens to fall within the company's recommended age level) I am appalled at the lack of thought and responsibility that went into the production of the music that accompanies this product. As sickly sweet and boring (to adults) that some children's music can seem, suggestive lyrics are not appropriate or appreciated by this parent. On top of that, carcinogenic substances don't belong on items intended to be touched by human beings, especially ones that are still developing. This is one item that will not end up under our tree
