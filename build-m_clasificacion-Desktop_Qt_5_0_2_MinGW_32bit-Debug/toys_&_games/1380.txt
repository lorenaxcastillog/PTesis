 I wish they were still making the Fusion Crew creatures because they made wonderful behavior incentives for my 5 year old son. This game works something like one of those trading card games. My husband used to play "Magic" when he was in college so enjoys the Fusion Dome with my son. You stick critter halves together to create your own creature and then compete with the other player. The dome talks you through the process and anounces the name of the creatures by reading a bar code. There are lights and sounds and the loser gets "flushed" down the shoot. My son can be pretty hard on his toys and this one seems to be holding up well.
