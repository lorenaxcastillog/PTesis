 I purchased this plug-n-play game at a local Wal-Mart for my 7 year-old. I brought it home and tried playing it but it did not work properly. (Got sound but no video). I returned it back to the store for a second one and it worked fine . . .for about 6 months. Then I noticed that the sound would start going out intermittently -because the cord/wire guage used was so thin w/poor strain relief that wire inside was actually bending/breaking after many times of being plugged in & put away. (My son would unplug & wrap it up (loosely) to put away each time.) I would recommend this game is JAKKS would re-do their cable/wires to be more durable
