 I am a 7-year-old. I love legos and I love Star Wars and I was really excited about this. But then when I was done, it was very very weak. So I put it on my mom's shelf and every time I picked it up it got weak again. So we took it all apart and built it again, but that time I ended up screaming and crying because part of the bottom wasn't strong enough and the front things began to break apart, so it cracked in half and I gave up. But I'm going to try to build it again because I want to glue it
