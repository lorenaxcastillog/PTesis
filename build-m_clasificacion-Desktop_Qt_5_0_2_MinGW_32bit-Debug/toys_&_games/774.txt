 My son loved this toy at christmas, however in less than an hour it was broken. The gears had stripped on one side, and it never made it out of the house. Now, amazon.com was very good in saying they would send another...I sent the broken back...but the toy was on back order until April, 06. I waited, at the request of my 8 year old son who wanted it so badly...the time came and went...the only way I knew what was going on was by my contacting them...they never bothered to let me know of any problems with the order...but always apologetic. I finally asked for a refund in April because they told me it was still not available....now I'm stuck with the battery pack that doesn't go with anything else....and after reading all the other reviews, I wouldn't chance getting another one, even though my son did love it.
