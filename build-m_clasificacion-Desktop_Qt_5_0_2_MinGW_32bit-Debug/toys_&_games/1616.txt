 I was really happy when I finally found them. We bought the Chicco flip'n'play earlier, which comes with 14 great Chicco blocks, all in different shapes and my 9 months old loved to play with them - and we built all kind of things together. I wanted to enlarge our options and ordered (waited forever, which is not part of my product review! but anyway) these blocks, assuming that they have at least some different sizes, allowing more creativity, but these 36 pieces only come in 3 shapes - 2x2 blocks, 3 pieces 2x6 bridge shape and about 4 pieces 2x2 with an angle on top (for roofs). So I am a little disappointed. On the bag are printed some different shapes. But unfortunately, they are not in there and I couldn't find some extension sets with other sizes
