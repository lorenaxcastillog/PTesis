 The game of Bunco has been around since the late 1800's, when it was a popular parlor game among Victorian families. At some point, it spread through the mining and gambling communities in the still-wild West and became a popular way to lose lots of money quickly. The game of Bunco has remained popular among many people for all this time, and Fundex Games has now released a Bunco Party kit. The game comes with all the things you need to play Bunco, as well as cute invitations to invite people to your very own Bunco Party! Bunco is a great game for an afternoon with the girls, a family game night or an alternative to poker (or your other gambling game of choice).
