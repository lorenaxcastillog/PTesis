 I recently bought this toy for my daughter, who is, by the way, in the age range listed on the toy (8-12) and she loves it. I didn't find anything offensive about the songs she is already hearing on the radio on almost a daily basis. I have explained to my children that it is not appropriate to speak that way to people, and I've never had a problem. My 5 year old even knows the difference between songs and conversation. When the two of them play together, they listen to music that is appropriate for both. I think its a very cute toy and fun for everyone when proper parenting is used
