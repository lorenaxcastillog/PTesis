 This is the first leap book that my son would read. Although he likes the idea of Tad and the other creatures and will gladly sit and be read to for an hour, the 3 other books we have get maybe 5 minutes of his attention. This is the first one he will sit down and read/play by himself for 30 minutes or more (He is super hero obsessed). I wanted the Superman one but after reading the reviews of it decided on this because it will read individual words and is more on his level (just 6 and starting 1st grade in the fall). There are some great games that encourage visual distiction and have some really interesting facts about spiders and some good letter sound stuff too. I love it, he loves it, and I wish they would do more comic based stuff as it goes over great here.
