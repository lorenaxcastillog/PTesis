 We like to go camping. Card games are a hit when sitting at the picnic table with a lantern burning bright. No TV to distract us from family time. It's great. Then it's time to turn in for the night. Everyone sleepily goes off to their sleeping bag and in the morning we find that the cards were left on the table. Damp, stuck together, wrinkled, etc. You get the picture right? Well, that problem has been solved. At least with the UNO H2O cards. You can play them in the lake if you want!! They will not become wrinkly, or torn from trying to pry them apart. This game was worth spending a few dollars more on. We'll have them for a long time. Why aren't all cards made in plastic
