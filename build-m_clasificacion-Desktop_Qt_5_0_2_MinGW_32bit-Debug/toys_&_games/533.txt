 I am now in college- studding to be a teacher. I however got the orriginal "Baby Born" doll when I was one. It was my first doll ever and I still have her. I named her Molly when I was three and would carry her every where. I of course had the orriginal that didnt do as much as todays baby born- mine did not cry, make noises, go potty but I had an imagination and in my eyes she was real. (I watched "A little princess" and believed that all dolls were alive) But Baby born to me was more than a doll. I recamend baby born for all little girls- and the women who said baby born is ugly- well I dont know about other adults but the adults that my parents knew thought my doll was a real baby- until they would see me spin with her and they would have a heart attact and then realize its a doll...that they all thought was life like and adorable. I love baby born and I am now going to buy one for my cousin Jordan as her first real baby doll.
