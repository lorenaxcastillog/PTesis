 We bought this while on vacation in June so my 2YO son would have soemthing to play with in the hotel room. Actually, he didn't take to it right away but now he plays with it at least a couple of times a day -- usually when I get on the phone and people ask: What is all of that noise!!??. It is extremey durable, the batteries are long lasting and it is very easy to operate. We also bought my son the matchbox size of this car and he loves to play with them together like they are mommy or daddy and baby cars...cute! All in all a great purchase that has held up very well
