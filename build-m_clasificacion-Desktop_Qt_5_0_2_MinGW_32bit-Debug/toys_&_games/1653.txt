 i bought this for my 7 year old for christmas. It has held up wonderfully and we have had a great time playing it. I especially love the rhymes on the body part cards. The pieces to remove can be easy to lose, but that is how all operation games are. I find a ziplock sandwich bag to hold the pieces does the trick. This is a great buy and well worth the money. I gave this a 3 star for educational because it doesn't really teach much more than the general shape of the body. It does have some great words for learning reading, though
