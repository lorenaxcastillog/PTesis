 No children... bought this mobile for my office, I'm setting my sights on the final frontier. A better mobile might exist, but I never found it. The mobile consists of cardstock photos from NASA; I would not say it is durable, but it hangs from the ceiling so that should not be a deterent... as children should probably not be hanging from the ceiling anyway. It's easy to put together if you have two sets of hands and hangs beautifully once in place. Unlike a lot of the other mobiles I saw, this one has a sun... nice touch. I would highly recommend this product. The world needs more mobiles
