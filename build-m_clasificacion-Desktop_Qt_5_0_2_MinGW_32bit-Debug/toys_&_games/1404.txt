 This is a well made product. It reminds you of a beach ball but when it arrives you find it is much thicker and more durable than most beach balls. Also, if you are the least bit worried about the print being unclear and hard to read because it's stamped on an inflatable globe, don't be. It's clear as a bell and a wonderful learning tool for little ones. My 4 year old was asking me questions that would be SO much easier to answer if I had a globe yet, I didn't want to sink a ton of money into a fancy globe. Also, he's not old enough to have interest in it EVERY day so this was the PERFECT solution
