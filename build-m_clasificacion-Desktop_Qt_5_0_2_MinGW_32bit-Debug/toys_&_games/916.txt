 Fun for a family of four or more, and for a couples get together. I only read about this game in Amazon, and I kinda liked what I read, but believe me it is Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun. We started playing it, and it doesn't take much to learn. I love to win some of the rounds in this game, but I have to admit the fights with the judges are fun too. This never failed to amaze me. We played it over a dozen of time now, and we only had it since Christmas. Every game has it's moments. If you like party games this one is for you. If you like arguments this one is also for you. If you like to make jokes this one is for you too. Man you should see what some of these cards say!!! :
