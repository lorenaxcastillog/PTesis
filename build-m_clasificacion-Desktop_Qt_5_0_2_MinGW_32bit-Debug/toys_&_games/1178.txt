 My 8 year old horse crazy daughter got this barn from Santa for Christmas. Unfortunately, it arrived from the &quot;North Pole&quot; in a huge box on my front porch clearly labelled in large letters on all sides as to the contents and she is a good reader. Also the glue from the labels is impossible to remove and the barn has a habit of flying open when you try to carry it spilling horses and gates out everywhere because there is no latch to keep it folded. Despite these concerns, my daughter LOVES it and I've barely seen her since Christmas because she's had her head stuck in the barn caring for all her horses in her own happy little world.
