 I really like this game too. The other reviews tell how the game works so I'll focus on why I liked it. My 12 year old daughter received it as a Christmas gift. We played the game for an hour and my daughter wanted to keep playing and asked when we could play it again so I know she liked it. I found the comments each of us made about some of the wishes helped us get to know each other better - we get so wrapped up in everyday life it's difficult to really communicate. There are 4 categories of wish cards (Experiences, Treats and Treasures, Accomplishments and Family Fun). Some of the wishes are very "girly girl" and ironically her Dad seemed to end up with a lot of those wishes. So, after we played it the first time by daughter separated those wishes out so the rest of the wishes would be more appropriate for her Dad. My daughter plans to use the girly girl wish cards when she plays it with her girlfriends.
