 My daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot. All the kids like it there. She got the Simon Says version for Christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks. She tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale. My recommendation to Playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin, no sound - just pure and simple fun
