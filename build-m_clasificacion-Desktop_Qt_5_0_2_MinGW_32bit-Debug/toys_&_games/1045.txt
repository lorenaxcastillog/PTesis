 Thank heavens there are still toys that just lie there, not doing anything on their own, until a child's imagination brings them to life. This is simply a basic set of Legos similar to the ones I bought my son 28 years ago. The only Legos I've been able to find in the stores are the ones that make up into one specific item--a plane, a Batmobile, etc.--just follow the detailed instructions someone ELSE has developed. EEECH!!! I want my grandson to learn to think for himself. The only thing that could be better would be to have a bigger bucket--1,000/1,500 pieces--with a set of basic gears and motors to allow for more advanced creativity.
