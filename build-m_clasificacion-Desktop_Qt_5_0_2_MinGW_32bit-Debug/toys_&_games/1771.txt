 My son and I watched this show and I thought the game would be fun to play. My family gets a kick out of it and plays together and individually. You can play 1 - 4 players which is nice, and you rotate the top part to reflect whose turn it is. The only downside is that the messages scroll across the screen between picks, rounds, at the beginning of rounds, and before the last suitcase is revealed. In order to skip over it you can press a button but it is still pretty annoying sometimes. I like the fact that you can turn off the sound due to the fact it is pretty loud. It is fun to play though
