 I purchased this game for my 12 year old son for Christmas. Since he has no siblings, I am usually his oppponent for all games. This game was challenging for both of us, used strategy as well as luck, moved quickly enough that we stayed interested, and was easy to start playing without having to read a huge amount of rules and instructions. I think it helps with math skills, too, but isn't so difficult that younger players wouldn't enjoy it also. I also like how it stores all pieces into its plastic frame to keep all of the game pieces together. It also has some ideas on how to play a solitare game if you can't find someone to play with. Altogether a great game
