 I was a little leery of assembly for this playset after reading the reviews on here, but my husband put it together by himself in about half an hour (the two tunnel pieces were already put together) with no problem. We bought it secondhand off of craigslist, and I would say the only wear on it is scratches on the slide from shoes/gravel, but that's to be expected. Our 21-month-old loves it, and our 6-month-old will love it eventually, and both of them will be able to play on it. This is a great substitute for the park when my younger son is napping and the older one is bored to tears. It's light enough to move it around while mowing the grass but sturdy enough to stay in place when a toddler is bouncing around on it. Money well spent
