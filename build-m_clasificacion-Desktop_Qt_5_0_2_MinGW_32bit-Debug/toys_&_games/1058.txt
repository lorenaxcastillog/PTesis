 Finally a paint set where I don't have to worry about spills or messes! My kids were thrilled to receive this from "Santa" at Christmas. They love to paint but I have always discouraged it in the house. (We have a galley kitchen,and carpet in Dining room. Worried about the carpet.)Well no longer! They loved being able to paint and it kept them occupied for at least 20 minutes, and I didn't have to hover over them. I will admit that my youngest daughter did dig into her paint, and it is all gone. But she is learning to use it correctly with her older sister. I know we will be buying more in the future for more fun!
