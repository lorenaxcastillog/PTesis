 My husband installed 4 of these locks on my sewing table. It took him approximately 45 minutes to install all 4 (Including time for me to empty out the overfull drawers!). My sewing cabinet has 3 drawers and 1 cabinet. They come with a sticky template that he thought was wonderful. My drawers are over 3/4 inches thick and with the extensions the locks worked great! They came with a drill bit marker to make sure you stop before you drill through the front of the drawer. I have heard that the older packages did not include the drill marker or the templates. I guess they have corrected the issues people have been complaining about. Pros: Drill bit marker, sticky templates, ease of use, the drawer does not open at all (keeps curious little fingers out of my pins!), little red latch to keep drawer in open position if you are going to use it a lot, and super strong! Cons: Pricey and instruction sheet had a lot of acronyms but if you read through it before installing it is okay. Now we know they work great and are fairly easy to install we are getting more
