 I purchased this game with the highest of hopes and expectations. It turned out to be fun for 15 to 30 minutes. Most of the audio just cuts off in many places, the movement is very choppy overall, and about the boards they give you to write down the amount of the prizes that you've won, yeah well, it would be nice if they gave you the amount! They give you nothing of the kind in the pricing games, so what are the boards for?! I could go on, but I won't. This game could have been so much better, I am not thrilled at all
