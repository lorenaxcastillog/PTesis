 Grandma purchased this monkey for my daughter on her 1st birthday. It was an instant favorite and she doesn't travel anywhere without it. I love when she has put it down somehwere and can't remember where it is. She'll walk around the house saying "Monkey...where aaaaare yoooouuu???" My daughter likes sucking on the tail so he does get rather nasty and smelly but luckily he washes really well and stays relatively soft. As monkey goes everywhere with us, I thought another one was a necessity. I accidentally got the large version of Dangles and when I pulled him out of the box and handed it to her, she stared at it, picked up the REAL monkey and walked off. (Did mommy think she could pull one over on me?? I think not!) So, since large monkey won't do, I'm buying the REAL monkey...just in case. I gave Dangles 5 stars cause I know how much she loves him and how happy and secure he makes her feel. Definitely worth 5 stars in my book
