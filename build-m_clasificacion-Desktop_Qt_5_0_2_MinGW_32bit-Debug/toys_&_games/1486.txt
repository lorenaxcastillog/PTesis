 I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old son who likes to help mom and dad in the kitchen. The directions are not very clear but my step son and my brother were able to figure them out. My son loves pretending to cook us a meal. I looked at PBK play kitchens but they are more expensive and take more space to store. This play kitchen is ideal if you need to have it in the family room or childs room. I also like the fact it is gender neutral. I feel for the price you get a decent quality product and it includes accessory pieces. I'm thinking of having my husband attach casters with locks so it can be rolled around
