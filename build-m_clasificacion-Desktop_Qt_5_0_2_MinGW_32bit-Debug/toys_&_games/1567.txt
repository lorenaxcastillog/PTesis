 My son enjoyed this toy since I got it for him at about 15 months old. He couldn't turn it on and off himself til maybe a couple months later, but he liked playing w/ the gears. Now when he plays w/ it once in a while, he usually leaves it running, but we haven't had to change the batteries very often. Not sure why it's rated for 3+, probably for the small size and stickers, but the smallest gear is about 1 1/2" in diameter and would be pretty tough to choke on. It's well made. The stickers haven't peeled off after a lot of handling and the magnets are firmly in place. The gears turn very smoothly. It works great on the fridge or on magnetic dry erase boards
