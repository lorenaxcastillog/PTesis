 I bought this for my 8 year old. Although it took an adult to read, understand and then teach the rules of play, once we got the basic (classic) game figured out, it was easy. There is an advance game too, but it is too complicated for us. We enjoyed it a lot, and it makes you plan and do some thinking, as to where to put your ships. My son always wants MORE MORE MORE when it comes to Battleship. The game talks, and it closes up with a carrying handle. That makes it more money than the other versions, but it is well-made and worth the price
