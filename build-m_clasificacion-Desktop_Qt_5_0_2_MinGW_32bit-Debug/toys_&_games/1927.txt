 The barn is really cute and tall for older kids. However, it does not "pop" up, there are three rods you have to put in and out when putting it up and down. Also, once put together, it stood crooked, so it would not stay up. If you got it just right, it would remain standing, until one of the kids went into it. I am talking a 19 month old, not a 12 year old crashing it. Needless to say, we sent it back and will look for something better. OH, send it back via Amazon. The company called me back after a full week, and wanted $15 included with the returned tent (shipping on you). Things that make you say hmmmmmm
