 HI.everyone gues what i went to toys r us and amazon.com and i saw these hamsters. i thaught they were just too tenderly sweet for me. so i asked my mum over like abillion times. Can i get this mom no she said.2 minutes later can i get this mom no she said AGAIN.then i really started begging her that she just suddenly agreeed. now just remember don't always beg your parents cause the secret is if you ask your parents once and they say no then be really good for about a week and then they might surprise you with you'r special tenderly sweet toy. so now remember i am and always will be raiting 5 stars. so just please try to test this. boys might even like it. if you listen to me and get it you can/could still return it okay BI FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!! you really did me a fauvor
