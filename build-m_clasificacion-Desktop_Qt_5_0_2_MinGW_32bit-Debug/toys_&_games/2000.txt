 This was one of my 4 year old daughter's favorite Christmas gifts. She loves it! Her imagination allows her to interact with the characters and she uses other small figures to play with it as well. Locking the supports into place and figuring out how to put the pieces in it when it is stored flat were a bit of a challenge to her at first, and she has fairly good fine motor skills. But with some occasional help she can now get it most of the time and she loves being able to put it up and down. It is made fairly well for the $27 price I paid and I have no concerns about it breaking soon. It would have been nice if they had allowed a little more room inside to store the pieces as it is a tight fit for a little one to master
