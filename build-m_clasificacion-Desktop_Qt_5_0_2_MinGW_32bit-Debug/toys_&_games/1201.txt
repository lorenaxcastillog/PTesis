 We purchased this for our son Christmas 2004 -- he was 18 months old then. He loved it right away and played with it EVERY DAY for 6 months. Travels kept him away from it over the summer, but since then, he still plays with it often, and has now mastered three of the (four) levels of games, in which the user listens to increasingly complex instructions and responds by finding an item or items. And now our daghter, soon to a be a year old, enjoys pressing the buttons and listening to the songs (which still inspire adorable little dances by her big brother). The bilingual feature is great (we have it in German/English). Our son mastered 1 - 10 in both languages quickly, thanks to this toy. But don't tell him he was learning; to him it was just fun
