 And I think we will give them 5 stars. It is true that they are very similar to some of the other products out there, but they are LITTLEST PET SHOP toys which are a huge rage right now. Pluses: The keychain attachment seems to be pretty sturdy. I've had it hooked to my [...] coat for a couple of days now and he hasn't pulled it apart. He doesn't "get" all the pet combing and stuff yet, but he really likes to push the buttons, watch the screen and hear the music. Another great plus, the volume is a very good level - loud enough to hear, but NOT so loud as to drive Mom nutzo. It seems like Hamster and Monkey are probably the most rare - hard to find around here. There are tons of Dogs and Kitties available
