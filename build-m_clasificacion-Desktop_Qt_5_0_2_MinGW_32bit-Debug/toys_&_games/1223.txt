 A friend bought this table for my daughter when she was about 18 mo old. She is now 3 and I have a 8 1/2 mo old and we will be throwing this table in the trash. First of all, the cookie monster part does not work - it never has. Secondly, at odd times e.g. 3 o'clock in the morning, it will start making it's noises and singing songs for no reason. Finally, and most importantly, it falls over whenever my son leans on it. We were going to give it away because it was kind of annoying but because it is also dangerous we will now just throw it in the trash. Do not buy this toy
