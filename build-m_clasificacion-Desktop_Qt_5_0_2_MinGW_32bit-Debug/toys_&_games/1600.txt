 This furniture is made very nicely, and is very durable. It is a nice addition to any little girl 'just moving in', but I wouldn't buy it at this site, because it is extremely over priced, $49 bucks, are you nuts? You can get this set at any store for $7.99. It's not like it's a collector's item and is hard to find, get real! I would recommend getting this somewhere else, you can get way more for your dollar. Other than the price, the set is cute and well made, but don't buy from this seller, he's over priced
