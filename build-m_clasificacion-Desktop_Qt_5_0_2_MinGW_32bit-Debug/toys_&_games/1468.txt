 I bought this as kind of a filler gift for my 3 yr old for christmas. I didnt know if she would get it or would like it..I have to say..my husband, myself and 2 daughters play this almost every night. It is so cute and has really helped my girls learn about different species of animals and what they do..ex. walk, fly, climb, swim..and learn their numbers. Even manners have been brushed up with this game for example..when we pick a card that someone else has on their board..we give it to that person and they have to say " thank you mom.." It is so nice to hear that from a 3 and 5 yr old who seemed ot have forgotten lately how to be nice to each other. I absolutely love this game and i even look forward to our time to play at night. it is SOOO worth 10 dollars..i would have paid more.
