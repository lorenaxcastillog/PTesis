 I got this toy for my son, age 22 months. This was his first Play Doh set so I wasnt sure if he would be too young for it. However, it turns out that this is his favorite toy. He plays with it every day for at least 30-45 minutes. Its very easy for young kids to make the animals (I kept the picture on the front of the box to help him) and he can play quite well with it on his own. For 10 dollars, its a great value. He loves it and overlooks all of his expensive toys in favor of it (to my chagrin)
