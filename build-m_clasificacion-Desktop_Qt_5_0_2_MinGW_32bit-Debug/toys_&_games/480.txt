 I loved Electronic Talking Battleship as a kid in the 1980's and have been anxious recently to play this game again. I was always excited looking through the back of the play booklet when picking out a board. I was also always nervous when the opposing player would hit the red button, firing their missile. You hope they'll miss but you'll get a bit nervous once they manage to hit one of your ships. You also hope they won't sink all your ships before you can figure out where their ships are. On the other hand, when you're the one pressing the red button, you're eager to hear that crashing sound - hitting one of your opponent's ships. A good feature of this game is that you can play someone or you can play against the computer. When someone plays against the computer, one usually loses. But I recall as a kid beating the computer a few times so that's not the case here. In all, Electronic Talking Battleship is worth the money and will bring many hours of entertainment. A great investment! - Donna Di Giacom
