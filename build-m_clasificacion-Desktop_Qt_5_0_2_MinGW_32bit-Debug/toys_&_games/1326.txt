 This review is for the Ruff Stuff Air Blasters Motorized Mech Tommy 20 Dart Blaster. The gun has comparable range to other nerf type guns. What the gun lacks in accuracy it makes up for with the rapid fire shots 20 dart capacity. The motor is a little bit noisy but so is pumping those other guns too right? Also, you this gun is really fun when you use the Nerf dart tag velcro bullets. The only problem is you have to cut the ends off of those bullets because they are too long for this gun. Overall, a pretty decent gun.
