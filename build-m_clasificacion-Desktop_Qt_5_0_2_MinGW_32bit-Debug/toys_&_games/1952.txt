 I love this key chain, it's one of my favorite characters of all time. I put it on my car keys and now I can find them no matter how much stuff happens to be in my bag and between me and my keys. The material is very durable and very easy to clean, I can just rub it clean with my thumb. Also, I bought this somewhere else for 8 dollars which seemed like a bit of a rip off, but I would've paid 5 without a complaint. The pictures and dimensions show here and completely true and I recommend this to anyone who needs a huge key chain or loves the Inuyash
