 Major fun! This pitching game attaches to a door for interactive play. We hung ours on a door at the end of a hallway. The backdrop is nicely padded and, so far with all the heavy pitching, there has been no damage to the door. The LED display that keeps track of strikes and balls needs three AAA batteries. The game does come with them but you will want to have extras on hand. Our son enjoys playing this by himself, with his dad, grandfather, and sisters. I hear a lot of laughter whenever he's playing with the big boys. Seems they like to argue the umpire's calls. Great family fun for baseball fans.
