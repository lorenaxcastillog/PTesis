 This doll is great, I got it just a week ago on clearance. CUte clothes.Plus, the accessories are great, this doll comes with soooo many!The doll itself has the regular build of a my scene doll, a lindsay lohan inspired face, and red hair with purple highlights that is super soft and shiny. By the way, did you myscene fans know that bratz were developed by a guy who was fired from mattel, then went to work at MGA? The actual inspiration for bratz was from Divastarz and barbie. Good bye for now, -Ali, the egyptian fan of my scene dolls (In egypt, Ali is a girl's name)
