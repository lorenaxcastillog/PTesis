 I bought this toy for my son when he was 7 months old, and he loved it! It is still his favorite toy - he is 12 months old now. He used to crawl over to it and pull himself up. Now he is walking, and he will make a beeline for it whenever he sees it. He loves the little spot under Cookie Monster, he likes to hide things in there. And he also likes to press the buttons on the front and dance to the music. I have found it to be pretty sturdy, since all the chewing, pulling, banging, etc. haven't broken it yet. He is now starting to try to climb on top of it , which is a problem, because it can tip over. The other issue is that the sound is really annoying. Maybe it is that I hear it so much during the day, but the whole "Eyes! they help us see our friends" thing is echoing in my head while I try to sleep. There is an off switch for the sound, but then my son gets sad that Elmo isn't talking to him. Overall, great toy
