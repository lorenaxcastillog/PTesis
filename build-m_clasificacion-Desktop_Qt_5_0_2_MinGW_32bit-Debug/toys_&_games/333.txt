 This is my daughters first "real" baby doll. She is almost 2, and I have never seen her love another toy like this one. She loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with, and I bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed. This doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls I have seen lately. The skin is a very soft, nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso, and smells like sweet baby powder! I was pleased when I was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. I love all the accessories that you can get for the Little Mommy dolls too. I highly recommend this one
