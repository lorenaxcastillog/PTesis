 OK, so this set is a bit more expensive than it's plastic counterparts. And more pricey than Little Tike's other wooden table (the Hudson), but that extra expense is WELL justified! This table (and the matching chairs) are not only beautiful but sturdy as well! The light wood finish compliments all types of decor. The light coating of finish on the table and chairs make clean up a breeze, which is a huge plus in my book! These are sturdy, well made pieces of furniture which your toddler and children can beat up without you worrying about paint chipping. It is perfectly proportioned for young children. My nearly 3 year old daughter, who is 38 inches tall, sits at this table comfortably. Her 6 year old cousin, who is 51 inches tall, also fits at this table comfortably! We would buy from this collection again in a heartbeat and would (and have!) recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful, sturdy, functional table and chairs set for their little ones
