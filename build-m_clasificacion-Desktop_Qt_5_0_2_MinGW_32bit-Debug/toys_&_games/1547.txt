 I've read several reviews on this item and quite honestly, I don't understand why so many people have posted negative reviews. This is a wonderful toy that allows children to be creative. My 5-year-old son has thoroughly enjoyed this product. I gave him a wet rag to use to clean it which does work better than the sponge that comes with the toy. I am not big on the stencils since they restrict creativity but he has used them to trace designs onto the Doodle Pro board which does encourage fine motor development. Overall, a great toy to take in the car or to a resturant or simply to use to make brilliant drawings at home.
