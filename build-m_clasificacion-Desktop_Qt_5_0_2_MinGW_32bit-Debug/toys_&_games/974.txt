 My toddler loves the Read With Me DVD system. This Curious George DVD for the system allows you to turn "pages" on your own, let the system read the story to you, or play fun learning games. My toddler enjoys the game particularly where you select parts and flavors for the candy making machine, then wait for Curious George's reaction when he eats your latest concoction. The entire premise of the Read With Me DVD system is good, the DVD's themselves are excellent and fun learning tools, however, be careful with the required controller you must purchase. Just a couple of fat fingered double pokes of a button, and you end up having to reprogram the whole thing again. But, my toddler loves it, learns a lot from the games, and has discovered that she can also use her "remote control" when we are playing regular movie DVD's. The controller has held up for over a year with frequent use (and the occasional drop) from a two-to-three year old
