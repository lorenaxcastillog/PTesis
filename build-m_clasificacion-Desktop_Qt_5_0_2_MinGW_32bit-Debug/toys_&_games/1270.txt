 Games has a simple objective -- get the Red car out of traffice. And boy! it is difficult and changelling at higher level. Set up the *cars* as described in cards and figure out a way to get the Red Car out.The best thing is complexity raange from very easy to very hard. So it captures kids interests and provides the extra incentive to move to the next level !! Simple rules -- once you have placed the cars on the Grid, you can only move them forward or backward. A great addition to this game is "Rush Hour 2, 3 and 4 Gift Pack" for less than $12/-. Each set has 40 cards or in total 120 different combinations are possible. The highest level is really really difficult. Meant for the "Pros" only !!
