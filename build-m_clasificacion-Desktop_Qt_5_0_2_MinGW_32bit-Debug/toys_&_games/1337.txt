 The puzzle is a cute idea, but the paper pictures wrapped around each cube is poorly adhered. The paper often hangs over the sides and/or is not glued to the cube, so the paper is easily torn off. I have had to glue every piece of paper onto each of the cubes, and still my children find a loose piece that is too tempting not to tear. I wish the pictures were somehow stamped or painted on. I also wish the puzzle came with larger pictures of what the puzzles were going to look like once finished, so the children can better visualize what they are trying to make. I really like the idea, but I think the quality needs to be improved
