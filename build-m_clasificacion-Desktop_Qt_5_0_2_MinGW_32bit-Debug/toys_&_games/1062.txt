 First, let me say, this is the first RC plane of any type that I have ever flown. After thouroghly reading the instructions last night, this afternoon I took Supes on his maiden voyage. I did have some crashes, but after about 10 - 20 minutes of trial and error, I started getting some decent flights. I admit I was skeptical at first, but this thing actualy does fly! It does have a tendency to veer to the right, but once I got the hang of it I was able to fairly easily compensate for it by steering in the other direction (I have not tried using the included weights to balance it yet). Keys to a successful flight: 1) needs a LARGE open area: for example, we used a soccer field 2)wind must be relatively calm 3)follow the instructions for proper release/launch. When you're flying you'll probably want to keep it over a soft grassy area, Supes earned a few battle scars landing in the road (nothing major though). I must say, my son and I had a blast watching him fly! Note: It may be a little too difficult for younger kids to fly themselves.
