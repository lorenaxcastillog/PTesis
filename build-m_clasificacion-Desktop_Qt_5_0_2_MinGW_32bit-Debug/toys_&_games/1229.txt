 I bought this item for my son and the Love and Licks Jack Russell for a Christmas party gift. The "bark" sounds more like a whine and I have yet to get either of the dogs to wag their tail or kick their leg like the box says. Followed instructions to the letter and neither of them licks. Sounded like a great gift. Update, I contacted the manufacturer and was told by the customer service rep. that she too had trouble getting it to work. Suggested that I try rubbing "extremely" hard under the collar on the neck. This did work and after getting the dog started it is pretty cute. No where in the directions does it tell you about rubbing under the neck. If buying this for a smaller child, be warned it will definitely take and older person to get the dog barking, wagging and licking
