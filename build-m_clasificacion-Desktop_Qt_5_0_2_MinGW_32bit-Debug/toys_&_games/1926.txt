 My 5 year old son got this from Santa this year and he is thrilled with it. He has been asking for this for months and of course, we were scared that it would not live up to the commercials. We were plesantly surprised that the toy is sturdy, easily assembled and is easy for younger kids to manipulate. This toy breaks apart into 25 separate pieces so that you can do several different variations on the theme- it is great to see my son's creativity come out! Plus the pieces are basically big and colorful enough that you won't constantly worry that the pieces will be lost. I highly recommend this, especially now that I see the price is $[...] less then what we paid
