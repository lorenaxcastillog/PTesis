 I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr. old, who is madly in love with dinosaurs. This is a really neat toy. He enjoys the little cavemen that came with it, the sounds the dinosaur makes, and it is clearly his favorite toy for Christmas. I think what I like the most, is the durable construction, and how it really enables him to use his imagination. It is a little lop sided, because the foot is raised for a stomping motion when you pull the trigger, but this hasn't bothered him in the least. His two older brothers, 6 and 4, hover anxiously for him to put this toy down so that they can pounce on it and play with it, so I think this is a great toy for a variety of ages. I'm looking forward to purchasing more of the collection for all of them
