 I bought this for my daughter's room so she could listen to classical music while she sleeps. I was going to buy a regular CD player and then I seen this one. It matches her room beautifully and works great. She's too little to carry it around or use it herself (she's 1 1/2), but she loves her "pretty radio" as she calls it. We haven't had any problems with ours and as for the "toxic" cord, I plugged it in once and I don't plan on moving it so its not a problem for me. The only thing that I don't like is the CD player skips if you bump it. It doesn't happen if you walk by it or shut the dresser drawer hard, only if you tap it or bump it by accident. I thought that was odd considering that it was designed to be carried around, but since ours just sits on the dresser I don't have a problem with it unless I hit it. Overall it is a great CD player. Adorable and functional!
