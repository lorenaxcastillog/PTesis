 I bought this bed for my son when he was about 18 months old because he just would not sleep in his crib. It did take a little elbow grease to put together but not too bad. He slept in it perfectly from the first night and never fell out. I used the mattress support from his crib instead of a board; there were no boards at my TRU and the salesman suggested I use the mattress support. I don't know why that is an issue. My mattress fit perfectly and there were no gaps. This is a great toddler bed, however my son is now three and he is constantly hitting the sides at night. i feel he has no room to move in it. I am disappointed because I was expecting to get lots more use out of it! From the other reviews I read, this does not seem to be a common problem. Perhaps my son is just a restless sleeper!!
