 I got my nephew a spongebob and leapster for christmas. I asked my sister how he does? She told me he got so excited and was so thankful that I got him a leapster which he is only 2 and half years old. I was informed he is already graduated from the spongebob that is only for 5 to 8 years old. I would rate this for any child to use not just ability of age but under the limit age will be able to repeat and hear them as often as they can to build their intelliegent. I can't wait to get him more leapster. He's already asking for more leapster stuff. I must say he's a leaster freak and plays it all day long
