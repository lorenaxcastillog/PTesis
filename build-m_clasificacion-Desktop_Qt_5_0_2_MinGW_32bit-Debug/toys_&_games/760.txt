 The Pretty Pretty Princess Cinderella Edition game is one of our five year old daughter's favorite games. We had fun gluing on the stickers and trying to match our jewelry set. Having to wear the jewelry adds to the fun. It's an easy game to learn and play. Her grandmother enjoyed playing this game and even glued sparkling craft pieces on the bottom of the jewelry box, much to the delight of our little Princess. As previous reviewer mentioned the game is not 'educational'. While I, too, like educational games, I don't think that every game has to be educational. Sharing time to play together is rewarding in itself. The Pretty Pretty Princess Game is simply a sweet little girl's game, one all three generations had fun playing.
