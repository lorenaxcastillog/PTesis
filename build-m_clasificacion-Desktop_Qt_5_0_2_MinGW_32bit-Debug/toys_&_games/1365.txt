 This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong. The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales. Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it. The fish is advised by someone "wise" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it. It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy. For me this is a terrible moral! It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way? You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous? It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet? Yuk!
