 Unlike all the bad reviews on this doll, I want to say how wonderful this doll is she does everything it says on the box, I know a lot of people says she doesn't cry but she does it takes a while if your child plays with her a lot and feeds her the right way she will cry, our doll cry's every time my daughter squeezes her hand, even my 8 year old son loves to make her cry, it is over all a great doll my daughter dresses her in different outfits and take her everywhere she goes...
