 We looked long and hard both online and in stores for a table that our daughter could use for a number of years to come. She is a tall 6 year old with two older brothers (8 and 9). After finding this table online, we waited before ordering. &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; Now that we have the table, we like it very much. It is extremely sturdy and has a nice paint finish. My daugher is thrilled with the drawer. &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; We also purchased 4 of the Brighton chairs in various colors. This set fits all three of our children and they enjoy playing kitchen or eating lunch together. We recommend this table and think that it may be a piece of furniture that our daughter can hand down to her daughter
