 This puzzle is great, and I'm glad I bought it for my 2 year old, Claire. However, like most toddlers, she prefers things that are HER size. I find that the hands in this puzzle are slim adult sized hands, like my own. Maybe the makers felt "Mommy" sized hands were the way to go, or simply that they wanted to fill the space in a standard sized wooden puzzle. I think it would have been nice to make the hands toddler sized, with chubby palms and fingers. That said, it's a great tool. We don't use it much for counting, though that is it's intent. This is more of a prop for the song fest of "Where is Thumbkin" and an even more exciting prop for the game of "Dr. Claire" wherein she repairs the "owie hand". All in all, a fine addition to your wooden puzzle collection
