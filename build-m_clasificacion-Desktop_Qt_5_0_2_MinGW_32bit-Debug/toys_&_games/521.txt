 I just got my pink idog today and think it is just the cutest thing. Although I am just learning how to use it,so far I am just so interested in watching it's movements and colors. The problems that I have encountered are that it is quite difficult to "turn" the pup off and that the "on" button (nose) is much too sensitive. All you have to do is very lightly tap the nose and the pup makes noises. In addition, I have found that the batteries are a pain to insert as you need a screwdriver. I wish like my ipod, there was a "hold" button to avoid accidently activating the toy and "wasting" expensive batteries. I might make the investment and buy re-chargable ones to avoid the cost. Anyway, I look forwars to using it on desk at work
