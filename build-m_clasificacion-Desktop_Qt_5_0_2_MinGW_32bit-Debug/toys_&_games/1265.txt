 We bought this house for our son when he was one year old, and at age 4 1/2 he his still using it-- even sharing with his little (1 year old) brother. Both boys love it as a hiding place when we play hide and seek, and they both use it for imaginative play on their own intiative. Of course they also love diving out through the side window . . . but we have been very pleased with this purchase. One caveat: We initially installed the house in the kids' playroom (what most people call a living room) to keep it nicer for a while, and to set up a nice play area for rainy days. However we now have another item to put in that spot and want to move it outdoors, but it won't fit through our front door or sliding back doors-- the roof is just a shade too wide, and we've had difficulty reversing the screws to take the roof off. So indoors it still is. I'd say the width of the roof is the only design flaw; otherwise we are completely satisfied with the product
