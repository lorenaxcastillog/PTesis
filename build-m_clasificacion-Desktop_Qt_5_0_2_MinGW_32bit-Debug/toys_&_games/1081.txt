 This was easy to put together and seems to not to be flimsy at all, as other reviews indicate. I think people need to learn how to snap pieces together: push tab into slot and snap! It's not that difficult, people! The directions were visual only but very straight forward. Personally, I'm the kind of dad who likes to build these things and then stand back and watch my son riff on the themes and use his imagination. As he likes to play with dinosaurs, dragons and king kong, this is a nice companion set to the T-Rex Mountain. All the characters and situations interact and my son's imagination is the only thing that sets the limits. Imaginext toys are fun, easy to put together, durable, and lend themselves well to children with active imaginations. Peace
