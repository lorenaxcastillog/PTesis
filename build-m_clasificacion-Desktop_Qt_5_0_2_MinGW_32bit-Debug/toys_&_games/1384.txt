 I originally bought this for my 12 year old son, but after starting it with him and then putting him to bed, my wife and I ended up drinking a bottle of wine and putting the rest of it together while planning our future travels to far off places like Tanzania and Thailand. Fun and educational, even for adults. Of course the hardest part was remembering which part was done before the adults took over so I could return the puzzle to the incomplete state my son left it in. He is working on it now ... no wine though. Overall a great educational and enjoyable purchase
