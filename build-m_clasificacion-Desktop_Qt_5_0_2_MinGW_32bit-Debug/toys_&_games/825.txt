 I bought this also along with kit 2 and kit 3.. while they do move a bit quickly, these books, kits, are suppose to help give the child an idea of what "they" are and how the sound. These books and kits are MEANT to be used with a REAL person, and to reinforce what they are being taught, they are NOT meant to teach the child every thing there is to learn! A teacher or parent should be teaching these things in full to begin with and the books and kits to be used as a tool, or as a back up to help the child as a reniforcement. If you use them correctly they are a wonderful tool for any child! Ho and if you buy one kit you really should buy all three of them because the three together are a wonderfull addition to school work, practice, learing, reniforcement of what is being taught. Sarah
