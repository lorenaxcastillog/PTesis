 I paid twice the price for this item at another location. I wouldn't say it was great at that price but it's a steal for just over $6.00.

It's not a game that kids play for hours (which is why it only received 4 stars) but they will play it repeatedly for short bursts of time. My advice, give all newcomers a chance to see how to "knock-out" both opponents and then play away. Even the grown-ups end up wanting a turn
