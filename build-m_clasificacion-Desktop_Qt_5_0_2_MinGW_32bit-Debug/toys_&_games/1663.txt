 Let me start off by saying We Love this Toy. However, we are on our 2nd one. We bought our 4 year old a black one for Christmas. We had problems with our radio from day one. In March I stopped by ToysRUs to talk to the manager to tell him the problem. He easily swapped it out and gave us the new pink/purple one. Which was awesome. However, again we started having problems with the radio. It started shutting itself off when you hit a bump, and then decided to stay on and not go off until the batteries ran out. I called the buyers protection plan people and asked about this problem. I was informed they are getting almost daily calls with the radios not working. They suggested having the store manager get in touch with the Manufacturer to see if there will be a fix. Obviously we will still have fun without the radio, but it was a very nice feature. We Would still buy again because my daughter is having the best time with it
