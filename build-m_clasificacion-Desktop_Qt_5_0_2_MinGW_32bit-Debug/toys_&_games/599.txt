 We bought this for our girls (4 and 2 yrs) last Christmas so we have last year's model so I can vouch for how well this has held up. They still love it and play with it daily. Great wooden design and sturdy construction, but let me tell you this is no small undertaking to assemble; it is easy but time consuming. If I only could have paid Santa to assemble! Other than that, as compared to the other wooden kitchens, it is a great product at this price point and much better quality than the plastic ones that make noises etc. as it is larger and in reality kids will use their imagination and don't need all that other stuff. My girls cook, bang, open doors and shove stuff in it and it takes it like a champ! The only drawback is that is is primarily made in feminine colors so if you have a little man that loves to cook Target now carries a great little wooden kitchen that is blue and has a stainless steel look to it plus they carry great wooden food and accessories.
