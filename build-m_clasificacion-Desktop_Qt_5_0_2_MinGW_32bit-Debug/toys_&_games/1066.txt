 My 2-year-old cousin got this wagon for Christmas and I was amazed at how fun it was. It is great for outdoors, and can easily go over all different types of terrain. It is safe because it is hard to tip over, even when you go over bumps. The high walls make it hard for children to fall out. It can teach your child to share because everyone will want a turn in the wagon and your child will have to learn to give other kids a chance. Also, like most other Radio Flyer wagons, it seems very durable if you take care of it properly
