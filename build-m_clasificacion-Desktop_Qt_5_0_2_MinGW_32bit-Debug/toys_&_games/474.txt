 The Sudoku board game allows players to compete in a multiplayer Sudoku game. Each player/team gets assigned a game board (mild, hot, or spicy) and races to see who can complete the puzzle first. The game includes two boards, two number sets, and one set of game cards. This game is very enjoyable and entertaining. Another neat feature is one player can use this game alone. Since the boards do not require a game card to work, the number of games is un-limited and can come from many different sources (books, magazines, website, etc), which requires you to place the given numbers yourself. This has provided us a great way to play Sudoku without the pencil and will continue to provide another way to enjoy Sudoku
