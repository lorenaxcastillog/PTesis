 We bought this toy for our daughters 3rd birthday. She LOVES LOVES LOVES it. The movie is kind of annoying and low quality, but I hear the family put it out on their own w/out the help of a "big toy company". Either way, my daughter loves it and watches it over and over and over. She sets the bar and mat up her self, it's very light weight. Although she can't fallow the steps perfecty, she does watch it and try to move her arms and legs like the little girls on TV. It's really cute. I didn't buy the 17.00 bella matching tutu. I went to target and got one for less then 10$. Ye-ay me
