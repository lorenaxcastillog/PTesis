 I seriously thought I put this toy together all wrong, called the Little Tikes company and expressed my concern about the wobbliness, the toys being either not there or weirdly sharp for a baby. The rep on the phone immediately sent me out a new one, which was awesome. Same deal though! So the company as a whole is great, seriously amazing! The toy though is not so great. It is wobbly, no matter what position you put it in (and good luck changing the positions!). The toys are sharp even for plastic. Basically my 21 month old and 7 month old won't look or play with it for more than a minute, rather my older baby uses it to attempt to climb! I'd stick with Little Tikes anyway, just not recommend this particular toy! :)
