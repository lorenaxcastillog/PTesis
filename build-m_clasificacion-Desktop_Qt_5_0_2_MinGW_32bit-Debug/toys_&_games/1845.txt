 My daughter wanted this so badly. We purchased it, through Amazon, for her 4th birthday. She absolutely loves it! I give it 5 stars because my daughter, and all the little girls that come over, love this. As a parent, I can see the annoying things that would make me rate it a bit lower. Assembling this thing was a giant pain in the rear, not terribly difficult but just annoying. All the accessories seem to get misplaced which makes one of the modes basically worthless, and you must....speak....very....clearly....in order to have the vanity answer you. Kinda tough for a little girl to do. With all these things considered I would still purchase it again. My daughter could care less about all the minor annoyances, she just loves it! I guess that is what matters in this case
