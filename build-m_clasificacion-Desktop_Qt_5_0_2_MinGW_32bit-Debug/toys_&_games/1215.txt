 We fell in love with this push toy at the store after our little guy, who at the time was only 7 months, started pushing this around. We have watched him tackle crawling and standing up really early so he's been an old pro for a couple months at those things and we were looking for a good push walker. This is by far the most sturdy one we tested. It works great on our carpet and on our hardwood. It doesn't get going too fast out from under him yet and it does have little things for him to spin if he's sitting on the ground. Eventually we'll get him a ride on push toy but this is a great start. Everyone comments on it when they are over about how cute looking and durable it is.
