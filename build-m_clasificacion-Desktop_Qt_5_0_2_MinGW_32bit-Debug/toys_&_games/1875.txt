 I bought this puzzle for my father who has Alzheimer's Disease. He's now living in a care facility where the caregivers work to keep the residents alert and engaged in activities. Some of the residents don't track well enough to do even this level of puzzle but Dad and several others enjoy it greatly. Today 4 residents (including Dad) and I worked the puzzle and they were thrilled to be successful in placing the states where they belonged. While doing the puzzle each participant would add bits of their personal history when a state name was familiar to them. Once the puzzle was complete each participant stated (and located) the state in which they were born...the state where they attended university...and other states they'd lived in or visited. To get this level of interaction required my assistance but they all had a great time! A plus is that the next time we do the puzzle most of them will have forgotten they've already done this and so will experience the success of using it all over again. (Family members of AD victims look for the small victories.) I'm going to take them the solar system one next
