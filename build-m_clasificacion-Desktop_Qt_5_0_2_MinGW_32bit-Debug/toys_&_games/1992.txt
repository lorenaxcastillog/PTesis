 If I could give this toy a ZERO MINUS on durability, I would. I have a 2 year old daughter for whom I bought this toy. My daughter watched it all of 20 min before she sat it on the living room table and permanent lines began to come across the screen. We took the batteries out and put them back in...same thing. Are they kidding me when they say this toy is durable for preschoolers!!! Blow your breath on the damn thing and it will skip...(see other reviews). The sound quality sucks, and really the picture isn't the best either (but both are suitable for a toddler). Apparently these toys are defective seeing how the problem appears to be across the board. No wonder this thing is no longer being sold in stores. Buy one you'll see for yourself.
