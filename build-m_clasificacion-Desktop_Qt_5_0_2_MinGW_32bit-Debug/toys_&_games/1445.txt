 This magnetic drawing board is so nice. It is the same quality you would get from Doodle Pro, but it comes with a magnetic Lightning McQueen that makes tracks along the screen as you drag him. Which makes it even better than the regular Doodle Pro. It also has two stencils that you can put over the screen and draw pictures of Mater and Lightning McQueen. The eraser bar is Mater. Oh, it also has a carrying handle, so that your kids can carry it around without dropping it, hopefully. Great item, my kids love it. There was a review before that stated that this item is not available to her after waiting for a few months. However, I just received mine from Amazon. I'm not sure what she is talking about and she shouldn't give a negative review on a product that she hasn't even gotten. It's not fair to Doodle Pro. Disregard this review. It's not accurate to the product quality at all
