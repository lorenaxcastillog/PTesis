 I got the bear and the wand for my son. The bear has a button in it's hand, and each time you press it, you get a different light show. The colors fade in and out and change. The bear will turn off after 15 mintues, so it's great for a kid to take to bed at night. I wish the bear had more uniform lighting, and that you could stop the light show so it would just glow one solid color. The way the lights are positioned inside the bear, when it's on, his cheeks, hands, feet and tummy glow. I think it's a bit over priced for what it does
