 My Brother gave me a few DVD games-Deal or No Deal, Price is Right and this one--of the three, the Deal is weak...SO LETS NOT MAKE A DEAL! I love Monty Hall. When I was a kid, I use to watch Lets Make A Deal..and love it! I would play along and say make the deal, watch out, etc Now to the DVD game...Even through it has host Monty Hall which brings back memories of the clkassic show. However this DVD seem to repeat itself and gets boring really fast. and there are more zonks than prizes. I will take door number four... the one not playing this game--and if you are smart you will too If you take this DEAL, you will be the WEAKEST LINK-BYE BYE! Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL
