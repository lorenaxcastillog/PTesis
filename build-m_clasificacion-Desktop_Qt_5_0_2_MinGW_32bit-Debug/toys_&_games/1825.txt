 My 4 yr. old received this for Christmas and we love it! It stores easily under his bed. It's great for play doh (contains the mess nicely and keeps that play doh smell off our other tables!) and comes with lots of cool tools, molds, etc. We put it on the floor and I can play play doh with both of my kids at the same time. However we also use the table for so many other activities like paint with water books (those stain easily so it's great using a surface that we don't care about staining), coloring, and more. Sometimes I pull it out and my 4 yr. old and 2 yr. old color at the table at the same time. There are lots of great spots around the table for keeping crayons and pencils from rolling away. We have a small house, so this is a fabulous toy for creating another work /play space for our kids.
