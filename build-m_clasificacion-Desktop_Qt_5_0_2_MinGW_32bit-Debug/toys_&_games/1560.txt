 I have to admit I was disappointed to see the FisherPrice stopped manufacturing the airport set. I saw this, ordered it and am very satisfied. It isn't FisherPrice quality but very close. My 2 1/2 yr old plays with it with her older friends (up to age 8). Since we live on a small island in the caribbean, the airport is a big deal here and gets alot of play. In general, I believe all children love to play with the airport playsets, and more manufacturers should make it. In any case, this is a good toy for both boys & girls
