 I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She was 2 and 3 months. She just loves it. It's a little messy since she has to have H20 but I just put a towel underneath, give her 1/2 a pot of water and let her go. It has taught her to pour without making a huge mess. Of course, she likes to try to drink out of the straw where the water comes out but that's no big deal. Education value is subjective and hard to rate. We have enjoyed it and purchased 2 others for gifts as well. Enjoy
