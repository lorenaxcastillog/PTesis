 I bought this game for my 7 year old last winter - because he loved the book so much. He quickly mastered the game, which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state, such as the color of the card, whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person's name embedded in it. All his friends liked the game when they came over, so I ended up buying and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew. But, more than that, this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son. He began playing with a wooden puzzle of the USA as a result of the information on the game cards. In doing so, he taught himself most of the capitals (which are also on the game cards) and the shapes of the various states. He continues to want to learn more about US geography. I highly recommend the book and game for ages 5 and up.
