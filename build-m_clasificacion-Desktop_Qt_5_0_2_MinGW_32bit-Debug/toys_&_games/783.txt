 This Monopoly game was exactly what I was looking for. I was impressed with the durable wooden property houses and metal player pieces. The "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards are neat too because they are relevant to 1930's history. There are only two things I can think of that they could have done a better job with. First of all, there aren't enough houses and hotels. I played a full-length game with several others, and by the end of the game we were using household jiblets to signify houses and hotels. Secondly, the property prices are not printed on the board. The game comes with a paper sheet that lists property values. It was cumbersome to have to keep referring to and easy to lose track of.
