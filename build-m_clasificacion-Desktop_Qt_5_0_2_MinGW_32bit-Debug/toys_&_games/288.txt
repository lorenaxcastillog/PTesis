 We have several boxes of these Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them! My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again! YES! My boys love this too!!! It's a great exercise for their fine motor skills! The patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful! It's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace. I suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time. Our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words. **Not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy.
