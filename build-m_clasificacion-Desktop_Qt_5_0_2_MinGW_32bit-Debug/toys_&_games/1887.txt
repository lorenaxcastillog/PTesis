 Even though I have tinted windows, that late afternoon and early morning sun was beaming straight into my sons eyes. These are perfect. I followed the directions, kept the other reviewers comments in mind and even though there are a few bubbles, I really don't care. The only tiny complaint I have is that NO WHERE on AMAZON in the product description does it say you are not supposed to roll your windows down; as it states in the product instructions. However, since they are pretty inexpensive if they come off I can buy new ones or just get limo tint on my SUV
