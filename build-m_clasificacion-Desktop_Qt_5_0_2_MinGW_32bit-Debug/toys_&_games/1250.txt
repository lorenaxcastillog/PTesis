 My son received this puzzle as a gift for his third birthday. Right away he wanted to put it together. At first I had to tell him where every piece went but it wasn't long before he wanted to put together certain areas (like the cows and horse) together by himself. Within a few weeks he was putting it all together without help. Because the topic is interesting and there aren't many solid colored areas, this puzzle is great for stimulating the minds of toddlers and preschoolers without being overwhelming. I would highly recommend this puzzle and other similar puzzles. Don't be fooled by the fact that some puzzles have large pieces. That doesn't mean a young preschooler will be able to discern colors and patterns. Look for puzzles like this one where it is easy to break down into sections. Again, a great puzzle
