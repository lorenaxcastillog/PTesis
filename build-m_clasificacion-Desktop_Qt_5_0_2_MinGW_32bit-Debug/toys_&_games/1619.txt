 Some others say they purchased the toy for an 8 year old. That is a mistake. It is much to complicated for your average 8-year old. I am age 12 and i thought it was a great toy. Although, I am the kind of kid who can program a website with PHP and create a light seaking robot from scratch. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it didn't have an age range displayed. I would recomend this toy for a 13-year old to an adult as it is rather complex. All in all it is a good toy. It could be a little cheaper though
