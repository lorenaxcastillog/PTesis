 I got this set for my son when he was 5 months old, and he still plays with it regularly after 10 months--and he is no pushover when it comes to toys. This toy continues to be one of his favorites--it is so open-ended that it allows him many opportunities to experiment. The blocks are really cute and each has something interesting going on inside (the hollow blocks are double-walled and have jungle-themed moving elements enclosed). You can stack or nest them (or shake or throw or fill them up or chew on them), and they are compatible with all the other cool Peek-A-Blocks and accessories, which are the same size as the center block. They are easy to pack up in a diaper bag and take with you, and the set has survived all sorts of "uses" without damage. I would definitely buy this again--but fortunately I don't have to!
