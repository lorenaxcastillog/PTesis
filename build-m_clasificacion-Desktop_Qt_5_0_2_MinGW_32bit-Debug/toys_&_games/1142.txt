 This was a gift for my 6 year old son, and I can just tell you that he LOVES this toy! He has spent hours playing with this (we also bought the Imaginext Brontosaurus to go along with it) imagining all sorts of adventures. All the accessories are great fun too. The T-Rex makes "scary" noises that the kids can control by pushing a button near his belly that also makes the T-Rex "chomp". My 2 1/2 year old son loves this too, I will be getting him one of his own because my boys fight over who gets to play with this. Very popular toy in our house! The colors are nice and bright and the dino is very sturdy (it already has survived lots of fights!). Great price too. Overall I highly recommend this toy, in fact this was such a hit that I will be adding other pieces of the Imaginext Dinosaurs to our collection.
