 This toy is Amazing my 7 month old daughter loves it but it was very hard to track down. I called all of the toystores in my area and finally ended up calling Fisher Price who gave me the number to the Burlington coat factory. After about an hour on the phone with a very nice employee called Liz we discovered that several of their stores have the birdbaths. However, if your local store like mine does not have any you simply must pay a five dollar transfer fee and within days it's yours for the price of 19.99. Good Luck.
