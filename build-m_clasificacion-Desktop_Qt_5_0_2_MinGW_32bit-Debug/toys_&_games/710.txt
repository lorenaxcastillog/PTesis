 My son received these for Christmas and his 1st Birthday. He loves it when he matches up the animals or vehicles and makes them make the sounds. He hasn't mastered it but has more fun with it. And now that he's 2 1/2 he's even more interested in how it works. Although a word of caution. When he was teething he thought these blocks were great to scrape his gums on. Which would have been fine because they are smooth but they have the little rubber dots to contend with. He managed to pop off one and now the ambulance doesn't sound. And he did not swollow the dot (which is easy to have happen). But these are essential cause and effect toys that all children will love. We gave our neice the farm set and she still plays with it daily. Great toy but another little thing to remember with the rubber dots...supervise and count the dots
