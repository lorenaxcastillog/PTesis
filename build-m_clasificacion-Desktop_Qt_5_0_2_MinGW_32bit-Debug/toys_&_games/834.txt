 I have to admit, I wasn't sure my daughter would enjoy this toy when she received it from a family member. But, she has liked it ever since the beginning, and still enjoys playing with it. But, I think there's a design flaw. The balls are too hard for small children to push into the toy. I've had to help her until just recently (she's now 18 months) - she would get frustrated otherwise. This toy does have a lot of cute buttons, but my daughter enjoys the balls mostly. It lights up and plays lots of music, so it's definitely entertaining for kids
