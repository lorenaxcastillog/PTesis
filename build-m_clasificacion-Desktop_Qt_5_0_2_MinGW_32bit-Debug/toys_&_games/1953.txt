 My kids LOVE this geotrax addition!!! The kids love to watch the trains go through the tower to activate the music. All you have to do is push the button on top when you start to play with the trains and the light sensor will set of the music as the trains pass though. After a couple of minutes of no train activity, it will turn itself off. The only down side would be that it's a Plus if you have lots of track and it requires some elevation track. So I wouldn't recommend it if you only have a basic geotrax package.
