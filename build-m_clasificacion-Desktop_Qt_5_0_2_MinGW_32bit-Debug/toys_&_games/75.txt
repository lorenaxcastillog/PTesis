 My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture. Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable. It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking. It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated. The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit. Everytime he moves, it pops out. The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him. He loves superman and loves having a cape. He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with. I suppose we got what we paid for. Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality. I felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy. Would not recommend it to anyone else... Unfortunately..
