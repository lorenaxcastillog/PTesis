 Hi everyone .. I ordered this for my Son's birthday (he will be 4). As it is in October and he happened to see it, it is in use now and he loves it. This is so easy to put up (pop-up style) and put down again for storage. The one thing I would say is it's a little too big for one child .. great if you have a few but I can almost stand up straight inside it and I am 5 feet 5 inches tall!! Still, he loves the movie CARS and Lightning McQueen .. so overall a great buy for hours of pretend fun at the pit stop!!
