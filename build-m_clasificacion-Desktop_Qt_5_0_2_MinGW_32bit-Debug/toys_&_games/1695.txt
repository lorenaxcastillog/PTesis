 My kids and their friends all adore this trampoline. It is great indoors for rainy days or evenings too. Santa brought it for Christmas this year and Mom and Dad put it together. It was a chalenging job but we did it together in about 45 min. I wouldn't want to do it myself because it is difficult to attach the elastic cord. Like the other reviews, you do have to make minor adjustment here and there but it's no biggie. Our complaint is that the whole thing just broke! A friend was jumping on it who weighs 70lbs. and the elastic cord pulled apart and broke in the middle of her jump. We are looking for the contact info for the company and hoping that they will replace the cord and maybe the mesh that the kids jump on. The riveted holes may be too sharp and caused the elastic cord to break? I gave this product a 4 becasue over-all it is great and the kids love it. I hope the Co. will replace the parts!
