 I just purchased this game for my 3-1/2 year daughter. She is a Dora fan, so she wanted to play it immediately. She sat there and played the entire game in one sitting. Basically, Dora and Boots are on an adventure to help find pieces for Tico's aircraft. Swiper makes his regular appearances as well. I had to help her understand how to do something in a couple of places, but otherwise it was right at her level. She knows her numbers and colors and she was very excited that she was able to progress. The best part about the game, in my opinion, is that your little one will be able to make jumps without any problem. The Pooh game is her other favorite (and another great game), but she needs help in making some of the jumps. In the Dora game, Dora won't fall if you keep walking when you are supposed to jump - she just leans over on his tippie toes like she is going to fall. My daughter was especially proud of the fact that she was able to jump on the swinging vines. I highly recommend this game!
