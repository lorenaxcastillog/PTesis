 This was a great item, durable, easy to put together, and nice grow with you item. This is not a good starter trike since there is no back support or seat belt. This is also a big trike even for my 2 yr old who is in the 95% for height, he could barely reach the pedals. I would say this is a great trike for a 2.5- 3yr old and one that has been on a tricycle before. I ended up forking out the money for the Kettler Brummi Trike and it is well worth the money! This will be great for when he is a little older and will love the big wheel feature
