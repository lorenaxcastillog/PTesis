 I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up. We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three. We lived in an apartment with a small back patio. It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play. He played for hours!! Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it. It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard. It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it
