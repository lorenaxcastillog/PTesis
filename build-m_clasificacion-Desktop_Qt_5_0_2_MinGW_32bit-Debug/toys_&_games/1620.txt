 We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas. First of all an eight year old will not be able to put this together. It might even be difficult for an adult. When we finally finished it we put it on and it was having major problems. The gears kept skipping. We called the company to see if there was something that we could do and they told us "Well, really this toy is not ment to last" a lot of help they were. So over all it was a giant waste of money. It has made it's final resting place in the dump
