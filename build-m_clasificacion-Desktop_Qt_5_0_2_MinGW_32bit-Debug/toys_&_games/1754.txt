 I got this pool for our back garden - I have a toddler and I'm heavily pregnant - I wanted a pool that was comfortable for both of us to sit in. And it's PERFECT. The aircushioned bottom is great for letting my toddler jump and land and splash around without hurting himself, and the sides are robust enough for me to lean against. Also they are robust enough for him to lean against from the outside and play with his boats in the pool (obviously only when supervised!) Because of the cushioned bottom, I could quite easily spend hours justing sitting in there; it's really comfortable. We got a little electric pump and it took no time to pump up, and although it takes a while to empty the water out of the bottom valve, you can do it without any effort (no heaving and tugging to turn it upside down). We're really happy with it
