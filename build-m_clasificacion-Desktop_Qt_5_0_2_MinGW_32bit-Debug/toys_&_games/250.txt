 Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts. But the surprise here is the complicity of Amazon in this misleading packaging. This is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found. They know they made a mistake. If only they would contact us each now for a full refund. I wish a rep from Amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger. I wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his "big" gift
