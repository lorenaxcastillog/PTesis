 I was so excited to try out this product. My son would always pull the roll up shades off the windows while I was driving, and they just didn't block out enough sun. These shades are pretty dark. So be extra careful when driving at night to look behind you. Before installing them on your windows make sure your car is cool inside and clean the windows really good with window cleaner. Have some patience. If your windows have any curve to them you'll have some bubbles to work out. But once they are on they stay put. I've had my shades for a few months now in my car and they have not peeled off yet. And my son doesn't pay any attention to them
