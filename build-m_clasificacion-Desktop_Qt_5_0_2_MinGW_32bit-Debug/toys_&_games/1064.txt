 I am an avid R/C enthusiast - I couldn't wait to try this toy and see if it really flew! So here is the scoop.... 1) There should be almost NO wind present if you want any chance of a successful flight - resist the temptation to fly in gusty or strong winds. 2) The right and left controls are VERY sensistive - a turn requires about one second of control input - any more than that and the turn will become a massive SPIRAL - it looks cool - but you may only get one chance to see it! 3) Fly in a LARGE open area.. Bottom line - very cool toy - It does fly, in fact it looks very cool in flight. It is very quick for a plane like this. If you have low wind, go easy on the controls and have a big area to fly it in you should have a blast - if not, choose something else so your not disappointed
