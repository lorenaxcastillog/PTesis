 I spent several weeks researching the best toybox to purchase for my 18 month old son. We were looking for 1)Safety 2)Durability 3)Value and 4)A toy box that would be a nice piece of furniture that would compliment the room where it will be utilized, as well as, something that a child would not outgrow (like a plastic multi colored toy box). Overall, I am very pleased with this toybox. It assembled rather easily (about 1/2 hr). The piece has a nice finish and looks great in our Living Room. Although, it is NOT a solid hardwood throughout, it is made very well and assembles easily. It is plenty durable for any child and has TWO great SAFETY hinges for the top cover. The top cover is partially hollowed and is lighter than a solid hard-wood cover, BUT is is very sturdy and made very well. I would recommend this toybox to anyone. The price was a little on the higher side, but it is worth it when compared to other comprable toy chests. You do get what you pay for. This is a good value!
