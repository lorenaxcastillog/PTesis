 I had high hopes for this game, but unfortunately, this product is average at best. The use of the DVD's slow the game and the questions are limited on how many times you land on a wedge before it stops giving questions and tells you to just ask from the deck. Also the questions are lame, What faze of the moon was it when Golum climbed down the cliff in Eming Mul' (sp?), What color was someone dress in a particular scene, How many days did Gimili, Aragon, and Legolas track the Hobbits? Who cares, and the questions on movie making are even worse, really.
