 WHEN GRANDMA BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3YR OLD SON, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIG HIT BECAUSE MY SON DOESN'T LIKE TO COLOR OR WRITE. HOWEVER HE HAS BEEN A TRACING FOOL SINCE HE GOT IT! WE'VE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS NOW, AND IT HASN'T BROKEN. HE LOVES THE SPONGE AND HE GETS A KLEENEX(BECAUSE ITS SOFT) AND CLEANS THE SCREEN ALL BY HIMSELF. (HE'S PROUD OF THAT)I ALSO NOTICE HIS WRITING IN PRESCHOOL HAS IMPROVED. I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY CHILD. IN FACT THE REASON WHY I WAS ON AMAZON WAS TO LOOK FOR THE ACCESSORIES. THEY HAVE MORE MARKERS AND TRACING TEMPLATES AVAILABLE THAT I'M TRYING TO FIND
