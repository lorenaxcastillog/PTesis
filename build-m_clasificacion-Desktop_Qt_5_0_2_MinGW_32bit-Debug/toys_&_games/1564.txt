 Our daughter is 16 months old and she loves this. We got it because she saw us use the computer and wanted to use (bang on) the computer too. Note, you almost definitely will want to buy some of the add on software to go with this. The software that comes with the keyboard is intentionally quite simple. We got "My Home" and that has much longer and varied animations. Another nice feature is that all of the software comes with many different languages. So we could, for example, switch it to Spanish mode to help her learn Spanish. We are so happy with this product that we are thinking of buying up a lot more of their software titles.
