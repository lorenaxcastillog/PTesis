 I bought this as a gift for someone else and was embarrassed by how cheap it looked when we opened it. To top it off, the sand in the timer was all glued or stuck together so that the only element of the game which you couldn't make yourself didn't even work. The parts look like they're worth less than a $0.25 and the boards and pieces are ridiculously cheap. They could've at least put an extra nickel or two into the spinner, the key element of the game. As it is, I think a kindergartner could make this game in their arts and crafts hour. I'd recommend traditional word games like Scrabble or Boggle instead of this.
