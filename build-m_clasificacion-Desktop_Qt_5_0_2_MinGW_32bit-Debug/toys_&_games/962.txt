 Another AFOL here. I bought this for my own Christmas present, needed to wait 7 weeks, and finally got to put it together over the spring. There are gobs of nice parts, and the crane does a very good job teaching mechanical concepts. As a learning tool it is a great value. As a parts tool it is a very good value. From shelf appeal, its better then ... well, a lot of things come to mind! One thing that is quite odd. The crane hook goes up and down w/ the boom as the boom extends. I reassembled the motor assembly twice, and the box indicates that they are separate control functions. Very odd. Steering is really neat, motor is fun, dual boom is spiffy, outriggers could have been a bit better, and it would not have been that hard to put a mechanical device in to turn the turntable ... This crane is a real step up from its 100.00 cousin... and my 4.75 yr old loves it!
