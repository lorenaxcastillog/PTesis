 Since purchasing this "Executive" set, I have purchased another one at a local store. Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better. The sea monkeys in the "Executive" set lasted about a month and a half. This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague. We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them. The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months. I believe the "Executive" set is overpriced as well
