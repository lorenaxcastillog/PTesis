 I purchased this for my nine year old son, (actually he paid for it) and it went from out of the box to the play room and I haven't seen him since. It's a great toy, reminiscent of the Might Max from a couple of years back. He loves it! The pieces are just the right size for his hands. There are at least ten different play areas in it ie. broken bridge, rolling wheel, bones net, trap door, the Kracken, magnetic boats, etc. He paid less than twenty with the shipping included. It's definately worth every penny, in fact we're looking for more to add on to it
