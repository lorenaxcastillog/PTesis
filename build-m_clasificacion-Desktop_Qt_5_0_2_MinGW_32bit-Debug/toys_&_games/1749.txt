 Grandma bought this for my 2 year old daughter with the hope that it would relieve me from washing crayon off the walls and everything else. The concept is great, however my daughter tries to use the color wonder markers on everything else and then she can't get the cap back on so I find them laying around un-capped. Also, I don't think she likes the fact that the markers only work inside the lines and there is a slight delay from the time you color to when the color appears. We've also tried the finger paints and my daughter ended up dipping the color wonder markers into the finger paints - which didn't work so well. I think that the plain color wonder paper might be better than the coloring book style pages. I also think that it is geared toward an older child. I think we will be sticking with the regular coloring books and washable crayons for a while longer
