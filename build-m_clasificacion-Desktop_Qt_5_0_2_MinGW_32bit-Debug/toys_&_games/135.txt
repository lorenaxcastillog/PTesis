 I was very dissapointed with the product, it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages....I ordered 4 of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them for Christmas, we found that they were "clumsy" to use, the sound quality is poor at best, and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be "whacking" on anything and everything as I was led to believe. We are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources, but I am afraid this is not worth the money. If I had opened them before Christmas I would have returned them, but it was too late so now they are stuck with them
