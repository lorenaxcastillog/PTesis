 I am 13 years old and my family owns a toypedo twister. It is one of our pool basics. We never get tired of it, because there are so many games you can play with it! Of course, how educational could a toy like this be, except maybe to sharpen your throwing skills! I would recommend the orginal toypedo and the trident, a toy that you can take to the bottom of the pool and send it bursting out of the water 3 feet in the air! To say one last thing about the toypedo twister, not one person who's played with mine has ever gotten hurt
