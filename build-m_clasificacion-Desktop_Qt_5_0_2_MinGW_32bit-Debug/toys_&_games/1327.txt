 Well, i haven't gotton this gun yet, but plan on for Christmas, and trust me on this review, i have done my research. Cons, this gun is noisy because of the motor, so u can forget about stealth, but who wants to do that when u have a fully auto?? Also,this gun holds 20 darts, so when your barrel is empty, RUn for cover!!!! The good things, r that you can either single-shot this gun, in other words, however fast u can pull the trigger, and has an rapid-fire action, so u will win the War. I will write back when i get this weapon, and look forward to the future wars i shall conquer with my Mech Tommy 20!!! =)
