 I am so seriously disappointed with this version of Spirograph. The old model had a squire and long Popsicle type disk along with several other drawing disks. The problem with this model is the prongs do not hold the disks in place very well. This causes the disk to slide under the drawing stencil. Oh and you only have three different drawing stencils/outlines unlike the old model. When I was young my sister (who is 9 years older than me) and I loved this "toy" and we would draw for literally hours. It was cool for every age group! I was so excited to see this in the "deluxe" version. My son was frustrated with this model in about one minute so I tried it out and I gave up after a few tries as well. Honestly, I ( a 40 year old lady) bought it for myself and just pretended it was for my son. Although, this is not an expensive toy.... It is NOT worth your money ... it truly does not work well.... and I am really sad about that!
