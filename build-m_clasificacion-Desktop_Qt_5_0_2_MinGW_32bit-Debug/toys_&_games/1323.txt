 Weebles were my favorite toy when I was young, providing me with hours of fun! My daughter is equally entranced by them and often matches them with her Little People and creates an entire city. My issue with some of the Weeble toys is that they don't function the way you think they will. Like with all the things that spin in order to get the Weebles wobbling there is often a traffic back up pretty much rendering the idea of the toy useless. The unit is so big and to not have it work properly makes you wish the could design it differently. I gave it four stars for the traffic jams, but from my daughter it would receive 5 for the hours of fun it provides her. Nowadays, I don't buy these Weeble play units myself, but never mind them as a gift. I buy the Weebles by themselves to play in the units I already own
