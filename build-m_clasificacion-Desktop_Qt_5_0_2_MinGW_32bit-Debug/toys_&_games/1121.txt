 My 3 year old grandson and I have put this puzzle together many times, and he hasn't gotten tired of it yet after 3 months of play. At first I had to do a lot of it for him, but he is beginning to do it on his own with a little help from Grandma. The color is great and it is very durable. We like the thick and chunky pieces. I just bought two more Melissa & Doug puzzles recently, because I was impressed with this puzzle. I'm sure my grandson will enjoy the T-Rex puzzle as much as this one, and I know he will be playing with these puzzles for a long time. A satisfied customer. Faribault,M
