 This game is fabulous! The game comes in a tin so it is easy to keep it in good condition (i.e. no broken box with scattering pieces!). The "bonus disc" has a feature where the narrator reads the questions for younger players, which is wonderful for your 3-6 age group! Adults don't even have to be in the same room to use the "party play" feature on the bonus disc, which makes it great for slumber parties! This game is also good for adult disney fans! There are some clips from older movies like "The Apple Dumpling gang" and "The Cat from Outer Space" (so yes mom and dad...you do have a chance at winning)! This game is perfect for the whole family
