 The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!! and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!! I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars. DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!!
