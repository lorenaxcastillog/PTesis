 Playmobil toys are wonderful, no question, but the more elaborate they are, the more problematic. This ship is gorgeous and has great detail, including real string rigging. This toy took forever to assemble, especially that pesky rigging, with the usually excellent insrtuctions falling short. After about a day of playing, my two boys had dismantled the ship enough that it wasn't fun anymore, and after three days I could no longer get all the parts back together. It is now a somewhat expensive box filler. The other Playmobil Pirate sets are still much loved, and have been conscripted on the nearly invincible Good Ship Fisher-Price
