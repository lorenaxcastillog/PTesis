 This is a really cool bubble machine. We paid $25 at a private toy shop, since Toysrus didn't have anything like this at the time. My 6 month old loved it and we would put it on occassionally for her. One day a neighborhood kid was playing with it and the bubble solution overflowed. We rinsed it out, but didn't realize that the battery compartment was not sealed. Later when it didn't work and we went to change the batteries, everything was corroded. We just found another one at Toysrus us, this time for only $10, and we're going to be more careful. Still a great toy, and I'm sure if it breaks we'll just buy another one, but they really should change the design to protect the batteries
