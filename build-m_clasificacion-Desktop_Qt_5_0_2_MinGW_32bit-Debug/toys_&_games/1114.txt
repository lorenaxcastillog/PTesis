 I love this doll! She's sooo gorgeous! I only own Brietta (human form) from the BatMoP line, but I am going to get Rayla, Annika (this one), and Brietta in pegasus form. Anyway, back to the doll. I really want to get it, but before I do, I wanna know what her dress looks like/how it works. I guess I would still get it even if it did look stupid. BUT, could someone who owns her tell me what her dress looks like at the back? Like can you tell the other dress is there? Does it cover up well? PLEASE if anyone can help me out! I have been trying to find info on her dress change for ever!! So if you could, please don't post here cuz I may not come back. But you can email me at tianemeth@yahoo.ca OR i_luv_bunnyz@hotmail.com THANX FOR READING!!! Once again, lovely dolls in the BatMoP line!!!! ~*~TiLLy~*
