 Bob Mackie has created an elegant doll for the holidays. Her hair is long and full, yet braided to keep it neat. The dress is velveteen with braid trim. Several years ago there was another Mackie doll wearing a similar fashion -- that fashion has been with my little friend for over four years and she still loves playing with it -- not a tear or a broken seam in it. Mackie is known for the beautiful mouth and the face mold he designed -- and this beauty takes full advantage of his creative designs. Great for collectors or for play
