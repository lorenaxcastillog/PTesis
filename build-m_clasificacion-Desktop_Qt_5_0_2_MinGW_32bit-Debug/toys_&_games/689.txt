 I purchased this wagon yesterday for my 3-1/2 year old daughter. I absolutely love it. She is over 40 inches tall and fits in it comfortably. I love the cup holders and storage area under the back seat. You can take this wagon anywhere and have a place to put snacks or other items. It is very easy to pull and the handle is longer than most. The is alot of room for 2 children to sit without constantly kicking each other. My parents purchased a radio flyer all terrain wood and metal wagon for her for her first Christmas. Its a great wagon but now she wants to have one to sit in. It also fits in the back of my van so we will be taking this to parades and for walks from now on
