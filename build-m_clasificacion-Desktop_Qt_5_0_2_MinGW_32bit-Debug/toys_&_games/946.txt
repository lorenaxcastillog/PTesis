 you've got to get this game -- having spent the majority of my twenties living in the decade that brought us disco, this game really brought us back in time. the questions were really challenging, interesting and the best thing about is that there are so many questions that i'm sure we'll enjoy this game for quite a while. i would recommend this game to anyone who grew up in the 70's or anyone who is just plain nostalgic of this magicial decade. now that i found it, i think it might be showing up under a few trees of my friends and family this season! enjoy
