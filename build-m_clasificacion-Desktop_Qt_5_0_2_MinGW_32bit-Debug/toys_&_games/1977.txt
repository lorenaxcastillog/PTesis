 Santa brought this present for my three year old daughter this past year. Boy, wasn't Santa surprised to find such junk in the box. The bar was junk, the mat was junk, and the DVD was worse than junk! I don't think I could find anything else on TV as bad as this DVD. The music was horrible. It's supposed to be a ballet DVD. Let's try some classical music?? Of all the beautiful young women on the planet, they had to pick this girl?? I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this was definitely the producer's daughter, as she had absolutly no other redeeming qualities. She has a horribly annoying voice, a face that hasn't launched any ships, and no talent for ballet. I have not let my daughter watch the DVD since Christmas week as I just can't stand it. She does run around the house singing bella bella dancerella. But I just put on our Dance with Barbie tape. Don't waste your money! If you decide that you have to have it watch for sales as we got it for $[...]at Target.
