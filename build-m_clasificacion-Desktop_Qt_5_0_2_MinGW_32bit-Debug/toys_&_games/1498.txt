 My parents had purchased this puzzle at a children's boutique a few hours from home. We discovered once it was open that the sounds did not work. I was disapointed because there was no chance that we would drive back to return it. Instead I called the 1-800 Melissa and Doug number and described the issue to the person on the phone. They were very nice and appologized for the problem. They shipped us a new puzzle at no cost. Great Customer Service!!! The new puzzle works great and my 18 month old loves it. She has learned all the sounds and it really keeps her entertained better than a "regular" puzzle
