 We bought this for our son as a Christmas present. As he was not quite two yet, I thought he might not totally get the concept and that this would be a toy I could put up for later. Boy was I wrong. He loves this puzzle set. I find he plays with it longer and gets less frustrated if I first let him pick out which picture he wants to "build" and then take the necessary shapes out and place them next to him. He is very proud of himself once he gets the pieces in then he'll give himself a big round of applause(which mommy and daddy do also). Great self-esteem builder and fun way to teach shapes
