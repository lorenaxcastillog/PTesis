 I received this wagon second hand, and I'm glad I didn't spend the outrageous price charged for it. Yes, it's relatively durable (although ours literally fell apart under my 2 year old the other day. A nut holding the wagon together worked itself loose on our walk and the whole thing went to pieces. Replacing the nut fixed the problem), but it also tips easily. The handle is much too short. I've had to tie a piece of rope to the handle so that I can reach it without bending over. It is a really rough ride, and my son never looks very comfortable in it. All in all, I think I'll be passing it on and buying something else. Maybe I'm just picky, but I'd rather pay for quality, not the Radio Flyer name. ***ETA*** Please excuse the incorrect stars given to this product. I'm not sure what happened. I meant to give it 1 star, not 5
