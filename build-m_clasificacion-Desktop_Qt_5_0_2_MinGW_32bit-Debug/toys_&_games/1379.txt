 My son earned some money for doing chores and bought three of the fusion crew figures at a Dollar Store. That was on December 17. He loved them so much that Santa sent the Fusion Crew Dome (currently available here through eToys for a reasonable price). Now that son (6 years old) and his brother (8 years old) are having a blast playing with this set. Despite other, more expensive toys (a transformer that was $50! ouch!), this has been the surprise hit of Christmas. Based on others' reviews, I have told them to be careful with the scanner bars. They aren't too rough on their toys, so this should not be a big problem. If your kids (boys, probably) love Pokemon--where they "battle"--and you want other options beyond card games, then I recommend this as a great toy! Be prepared to search for the figures though. Right now, FisherPrice.com has some of them, too
