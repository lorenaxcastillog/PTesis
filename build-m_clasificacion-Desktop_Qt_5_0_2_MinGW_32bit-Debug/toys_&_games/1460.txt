 Very good set of figurines, excellent for a birthday cake (which is what we used them for*), perfect size, all-inclusive (nearly every character in the movie is in the box. The only problem I had with this set is they were not painted very well (appeared to be hand-painted very quickly). But then, what do you expect anymore from imported mass-produced products? *The typical birthday cake for the Incredibles that is available only includes a silly little Dash/Mr Incredible toy. My daughter likes ALL the Supers, especially Frozone and Violet, so why leave them out? That was my reason for buying this item! :
