 This is a kit with directions and equipment for ten magic tricks. Some of the items are made of paper and seem a bit flimsy. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the stacking boxes needed some reshaping. However, overall, this is a great kit. My son worked hard practicing and practicing and showing off his magic tricks. We did one a day for a few days running. It taught him to work at practice and it helped him practice his speaking in public (since he performed for everyone!)He was able to complete most of the magic tricks with little help after one demonstration. Lots of fun. Enjoy.
