 We bought this for our son for x-mas, he already has a voice changer that he plays with a lot, but it's one of those bull horn type things that you have to hold up, so we thought he'd like this. It only changes the voice in 2 ways and then it's a matter of turning the tone up and down. The headpiece for the microphone is designed to fit a very large adult and doesn't go down to a small enough size. The one we got I think was a returned item refurbished, because upon opening the seal of the item had chips in it (not the top or bottom) and the voume control just spun, which made it difficult to turn on. For a $16 dollar item, I'm not sure it's worth the return cost to return it and get a new one, it just isn't all that fun for a 6 year old, he prefers the old bull horn one we have
