 We use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. It's intended for children a little older, and I can see why, as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. However, my 2-year-old can use it by herself, and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. I had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old, but when doing so, it also allowed him to color. I would recommend it, especially for children 3 and up.
