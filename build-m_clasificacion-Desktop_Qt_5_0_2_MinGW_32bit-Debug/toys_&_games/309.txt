 This playset is great - my son loves it. You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off. My only complaint was puting it together. The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures. The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle. Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help. Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic
