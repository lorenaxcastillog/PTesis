 I have spent a great deal of time and money looking around for games and tools that my 9 year old with special educational needs could play without being self-concious. He has been teased over and over about games that he plays with being a "baby" game, but leapster managed to help out with that. I HIGHLY reccomend any L-Max game. These games are based on education within a "normal" game setting. You can't advance in the game without getting the answers correct. Leapster is the answer to my prears. Fun and learning at the same time. If you have a child that is behind in the major subjects invest your money in leapster. You won't be sorry!
