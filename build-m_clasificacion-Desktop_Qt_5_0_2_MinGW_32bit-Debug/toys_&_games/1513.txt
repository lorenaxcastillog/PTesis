 We had the pleasure of playing FOR THE RECORD 80's-90's with some family and friends. We played using teams to try to pool our knowledge. The packaging and graphics are very well done. It has a double-necked guitar game path covered with 80's-90's images. You feel like you've gone back in time. The multiple choice format was very helpful as some of our memories aren't what they used to be. One of the teams chose not to use the multiple choice answers on their turns for an extra challenge. The categories are "80's","90's", "Mosh Pit", "You're On Stage" and the toughest ones, "One Hit Wonder" and "Real Name". We had fun because the game requires a mix of luck and skill. The questions range from easy to very difficult, so there was something for everybody. Nobody felt left out! We played three times that night averaging about 45-50 minutes per game (with alot of singing and air guitar thrown in). Our place was rockin' and we can't wait to play again. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!
