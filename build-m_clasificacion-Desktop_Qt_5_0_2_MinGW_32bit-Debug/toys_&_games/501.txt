 I bought this because she is at that age of stacking things. I thought this would be perfect for her. However it is not enough. There is only two things to stack and the spoon doesn't really have a place for it. Also the numbers on it doesn't have any interaction with it, meaning it is just printed on the toy and that is it. The sorting of the shapes are a great idea however and it is very durable. She will bang on it with the spoon as well. I guess for the price I was disappointed. But she does have fun with it
