 I picked one up from a local Target today along with a General Grievous Starfighter and Droid Battle Pack, both of which I've also written reviews on. I'm lovin it. This set comes with 4 clone trooper MiniFigs, 2 white, one red, and one yellow. The markings are pretty nice. There are only 2 blasters and a set of binoculars for the four clones, but blasters on the speeder andgun turret that you can take off if you need extra. The blasters are new, shaped like a normal clone trooper blaster and nicely detailed. The speeder is cool. It seats two clones,a driver and a gunner. The turret really isn't anything special. The gun isn't that movable, but it's larger than the other blasters and looks cool for a clone scout. I would have swapped the turret for another clone MiniFig and blaster, butthat's just me. Basically, you get 4 clone troopers, a mediocre gun turret, and a nive speeder for just $10! It's great for building a clone army since it's so cheap, and it's really cool if you already have a Clone Turbo Tank or Republic gunship. Pick a few of these up, you won't regret it
