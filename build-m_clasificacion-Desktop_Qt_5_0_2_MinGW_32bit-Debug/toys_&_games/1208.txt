 I just recieved this game yesterday and I love it. The first time I played it I won a million dollars, to bad it wasn't for real. The thing I like about this game unlike some other hand held ones I have played is that you can turn it off, it has a little blue button at the top that turns it on and off. It will save your game too if you have to turn it off for some reason, which for me is great cause I have 4 little kids that don't always let me sit for very long. I got the electronic game too but haven't played it yet, I like to watch the show but I love to play the game, I got tired of playing it on the website so I purchused this to see if it was funner and it is.
