 My one year old son loves to play with toy kitchens whenever he sees one, but I did not want to pay big $$ for a toy kitchen. I am so glad that I found this one. He is 13 months old and it is perfect for him. Very inexpensive but VERY cute and fun. He is not yet walking, so I just put it up against the wall. So far, it has not tipped over once. It is the perfect kitchen for him. He already pretends to cook and eat the play food that is included. My husband also liked the fact that it is not girlie in any way
