 This is a fabulous toy! My son received it at around 8 months, and still loves it as he approaches his first birthday. We often spend an hour straight playing with it; he loves to examine each bird, to put them in, peek into the birdhouse to see what they're up to, and pull them back out. Between the large door, the small hole and the roof that opens, there are lots of options. The engineering on this is exceptional. The fabrics are bright and stimulating. I highly recommend this for your own child, or as a stand-by gift for any child between 6 and 24 months.
