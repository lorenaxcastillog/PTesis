 I bought a lightsaber like this one right before the realease of episode 3. I also bought a electronic color changing one which i thought would be way cooler then the basic lightsaber. Putting it quite frankly i was terribly mistaken. Sure the electronic lightsaber has the sounds and changes color but u cant even see it in daylight. Plus the basic lightsaber is half the cost of a electronic lightsaber. My friends and i play in the woods every day with our lightsabers. To tell u the truth i traded the lightsaber that changes color for YUGIOH cards. the only bad thing is it is not very educational. it is however quite entertaining. I think the worst thing is if you drop a lightsaber the handle will probaly get scratched or if u use them regularly the blade may be dented. Overall very good by i suggest u buy more and wait until they make better electronic ones
