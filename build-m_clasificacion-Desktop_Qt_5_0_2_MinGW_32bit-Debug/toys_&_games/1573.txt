 I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old for Christmas. She already has an entire bin of dress up "Princess Clothes" that add a nice finishing touch. This is by far one of the most enjoyable "toys" I have seen in quite awhile. I also have a 16 month old who enjoys it as much as her older sister. Some of the dance moves are a bit old for them, but it doesn't seem to ruin the fun. We all dress up (finally found a use for old bridesmaids dresses), get our magic wands ready and dance away. It's actually a very good workout. The songs are familiar, the "skit" is enjoyable and it gets all of us up off of the couch. I highly recommend this to anyone with little girls!!! And the rest of us who like to get in touch with the Princess side in all of us
