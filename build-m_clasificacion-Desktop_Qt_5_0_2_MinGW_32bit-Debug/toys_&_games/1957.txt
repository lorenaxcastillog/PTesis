 This toy is durable! It has survived my 10 year old son's early childhood, and now has (so far) survived my 3 year old daughter's attacks. Both children love it, but as others have mentioned, some pieces are loose and it takes perserverence to keep it together. My cure is that I hide it except for trips to the doctors and other appointments. This makes it a &quot;special&quot; toy, and it is easier to keep track of the parts. Many bright pages of colors keep their interest, and though they love pulling out the snap-on pieces, they are difficult for little one's to snap on. The velcro balloons that are attached are my daughter's (and mine) favorite part. The buckle is too difficult for her, but she loves putting her hand in the glove and unzipping the lady-bug to find &quot;baby&quot; lady bugs. I feel the positives far outweigh the negatives and highly recommend this toy--after all, if she is not losing these pieces under the couch, she would be losing her barbie car keys, lego pieces, building blocks, lincoln logs (etc) under the couch
