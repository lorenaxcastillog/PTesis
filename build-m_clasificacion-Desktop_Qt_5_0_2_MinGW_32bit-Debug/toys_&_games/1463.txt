 I was happy to give my 9 year old cousin a game to exercise her brain rather than a Barbie or a video game. She learned the rules in the first 5 minutes of the first game, with just a few snags (had trouble understanding that the discs must be placed contigously. also occasional trouble understanding that discs cannot be flipped if they are surrounded by an opponent's disc by an indirect move). But the point is, she was able to play right away, and will eventually gain skills at strategy. her dad is teaching her to play chess now, which is all about strategy but is harder. Othello is a good game to be playing at the same age while learning chess, because it's easier but exercises the same parts of the brain for strategy and thinking ahead.
