 This is a great pirate ship for young kids. We bought it for my 5-year-old, who loves it, as does his 3-year old brother. Lots of details and pirates. I was looking at this ship, and the more expensive Playmobil pirate ship. I'm definitely glad I bought this one -- has all the details my boys adore, but a better price tag. I definitely recommend this as a great toy. My boys have been playing with their Playmobil toys for a few years -- they are still the toys they play with the most. And, they are so great for their imagination
