 I initially bought this set for my three-year-old but thought better of it since he was almost 4. So, I bought him a regular set of Legos and was going to take these back. However, after much frustration with the smaller legos, i.e. not being able to get them apart very easily, etc., I brought these out and well, it's been true love ever since. I really recommend these for the younger set - I bought the smaller ones because I didn't think he'd get much good out of these since they indicate that they're only to age 5. Don't pay any attention to the age on these. They can expand and older kids can use these and since they smaller ones say age three, I wouldn't pay attention to that either. Grab the bigger ones for ages 2-6 or so, they will be able to use them and have fun as well
