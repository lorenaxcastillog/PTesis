 I find this set to be exactly as the set I played with in the 1970s. The five pages of shapes are in a spiral bound book - there are tons of shapes which is great. My kids, younger than the suggested age at 21 months old, really seem to enjoy this toy - they love stickers, however unlike stickers, Colorforms don't ruin furniture when stuck on wood! Our Colorforms did not stick well to the two included boards at all - in fact, they fell right off. I saw another reviewer mention this as well. I called the manufacturer and they are sending me another set - hopefully these will work better. I am hoping these are isolated incidents and not an overall product problem. All in all, a good toy with good play value!
