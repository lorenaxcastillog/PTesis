 My 6 year old got this guitar for three kings day (precisely today, January 6). In my opinion the songs are only appropiate for girls age 6 and up, since it has 2 cartridges with 6 popular rock-pop songs that you can find on the comercials for kids bop songs in cartoon network. The volume control is great, so that way you don't get headaches from the loud and constant play, but the headset is kind of confusing. I posted some images from my daughter (the brunette one) showing the "I guess" the correct way to wear the headphones. Overall, I like this guitar anyways. Hope this help for the other moms.
