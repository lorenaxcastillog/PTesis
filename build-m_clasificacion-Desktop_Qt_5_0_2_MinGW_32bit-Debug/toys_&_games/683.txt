 My daughter was pleased as punch. She got 900 feet (that's a lot for child sized mittens and scarves!) of yarn and a pretty basket to keep the things neat. The needles were just fine. A few other kits at our local shop were going for twice this and didn't have as much yarn and the "baskets" were cheap plastic tubs. If something is damaged I know we usually exchange the item to the store or call the manufacturer and they're more than happy to replace items. Also my daughter is seven years old and just entered 1st grade and she had no problems understanding the instructions with a little help from me
