 I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay. Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down. Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified. This has it's pros and cons. It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components. 2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update. 3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed. One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring. I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games. Too bad for them. Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me
