 We bought this hot tub a few months ago and we really love it. It was so easy to fill and just plug and play. The waterfull is especially pretty at night. (this is one of the only tubs in its price range with colorchanging water fall and seats built in that we had seen). Being our first hottub we did alot of research and decided we did not want to have to rewire our electric in case we want to move it around. It is made great for the price and the shell is very sturdy.It did take quite a while to heat up (we live near Chicago so it is cold here). But once heated it retains heat well. If considering a tub in this price range I would definately consider this tub. We use it every day, even in the freezing weather right out back on a concrete pad. Only thing we kind of wish we would have bought the X-500 model which seats five and has a lounger seat in it, but I am sure we will be getting our moneys worth from this
