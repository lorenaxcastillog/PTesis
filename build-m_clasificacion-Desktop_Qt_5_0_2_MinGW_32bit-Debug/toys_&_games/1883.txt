 I bought this for my son who was having a lot of trouble remembering his multiplication facts. He is typically a good student. When he was in fifth grade he was getting poor marks in math due to not knowing his facts. We tried flash cards, games, nothing helped. When he first got this he would want to play with it on his own, which was great. After he got bored with it I would encourage him use it, which he did. After just a few months he learned his facts by heart! What a painless and fun way to learn something so dull, yet vital. I think this is a great learning toy
