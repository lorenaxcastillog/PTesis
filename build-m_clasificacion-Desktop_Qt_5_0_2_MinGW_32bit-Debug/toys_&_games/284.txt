 This is a great game that is made very well. It is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors. It will last us many years. I bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play. It will surely be a hit! My daughter (8 years old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it. It has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty. I would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children. This game is best played on a table, so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags
