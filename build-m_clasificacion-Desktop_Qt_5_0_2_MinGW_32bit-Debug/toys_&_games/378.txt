 my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!
