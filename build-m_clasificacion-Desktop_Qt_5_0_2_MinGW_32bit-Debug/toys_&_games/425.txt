 This was my first Schleich World of Knights figure, given to me Christmas of this year. It's a highly detailed classic dragon, with no moving or detachable parts (the wings are an integral part of the figure). As such, it's safe for very young children, and you don't have to worry about someone's eye getting put out. As to its historical accuracy and educational value, I really cannot say, never having seen Dragons in the wild, but the level of detail is wonderful, and it should encourage children to obtain the more "practical" members of the balance of Scheich World of Knights collection, which are excellent, as well
