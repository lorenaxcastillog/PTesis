 I bought another rock tumbler. It was all plastic and the drive to the barrel was a direct contact wheel against a rubber belt. It wore out. FAST. And it was so loud that even when I put it in the garage I could hear it. I had to replace it. This tumbler (Model A-R1)has been running 24-7 for five months. It's so quiet I put it in the basement. The stones that come out are beautiful. If anything ever does wear out, (it never has), or if I need supplies it's easy to purchase what I need from the supplier's catalog. Try this one first; it's a little more expensive, but you'll sleep at night
