 There's no denying I love these products. I'm a grandma and my 5 yr old grandson loves them too. I gave Shark's Prey to his cousin (3 1/2) when I gave the Pirate Chest to my grandson at Christmas and they played with them together. I'm learning that at that age you need to interact and "imagine" with them. Make up stories and use all the wonderful figures and accessories to stimulate their imagination. My grandson now realizes that there are good pirates who can relax under moonlit skies - a palm tree oasis in the Treasure Chest, invite dinosaurs to their habitat, and fight off sharks to catch fish to feed all the needy...then s.e.e.k and confiscate a treasure to make all their wishes come true. Another adventure!!
