 We have the old Celebration castle and were looking to replace it because things that look nice were constantly falling off. This is really nice and doesn't have any external decorative things that can fall off and frustrate my daughter. Read the directions though! The old castle opened out without batteries required. I knew this one required batteries for some lights and music number I assumed, but no. You need the batteries to make the castle pop open. Learn from me and insert the batteries right away! Other than that which was my operator error,it's a great toy that is already much better than the old one. I would have given it 4 stars because there really should be an alternate way of opening it besides batteries but my daughter loves it and wanted it to get 5 stars
