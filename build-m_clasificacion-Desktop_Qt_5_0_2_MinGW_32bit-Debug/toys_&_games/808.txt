 I have a nine year old and an eight month old and I think I am the one spending the most time with our Musini. I actually loved it so much I bought another two for a couple of our friends. The three of them see a lot of use on pretty much a daily basis with no sign of any difficulties whatsoever. I have my eight month old stand (with my help) in front of the unit and we dance away! My nine year old and I dance around it until we fall down laughing. We all have a great time switching up the tunes and taking turns acting crazy. We love our Musini
