 I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. The product I feel is designed well, and is small enough to fit in her room. A previous review stated they had difficulty building it, but if you follow the directions (step one shows to leave the screws loose), it goes together easily. My husband and I were able to put this together in less than 1/2 hour including trying to stop our daughter from playing with it while it was under construction. Another reviewer had voiced disappointment over the door to the fridge not closing completely. Ours doesn't close all the way, but it stays closed. No Little Tikes toy I have ever purchases has latches to close the doors. The sound level is great in the high position, and she enjoys the comments it makes. I haven't had any trouble with understanding what the voice is saying as others have commented. We're planning on buying some of the additional food sets for more play. Overall I think this was a great buy, and I feel it will be keeping my daughter (and I!) busy for many many hours ahead
