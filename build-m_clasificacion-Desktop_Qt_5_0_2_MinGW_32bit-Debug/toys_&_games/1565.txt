 We purchased this toy becuase my husband had one when he was a toddler - about 51 years ago! While we still have that toy it has gone through many children's hands and is not very playable for our own kids now. I thought a remake would be alike but it isn't. The "grun-grun" sound is not the same and much of the toy is made from plastic instead of wood. The string is quite short so not practical for even my two year old to pull unless I add a longer string to it. Overall it is a cute dog and durable looking toy -but I wonder will it last as well as the 50+ year old original?
