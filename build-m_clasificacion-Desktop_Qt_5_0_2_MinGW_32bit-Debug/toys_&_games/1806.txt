 The thing I love about Pictionary - apart from laughing at the crazy drawings people come up with - is that you don't have to be a great artist to win. That's good for me, I can tell you! You see, it's not so much how *well* you can draw, but more how well you can get a point across in *what* you draw. I've seen people guess the right answer from some pretty simple line drawings. In fact, you'll be amazed at how some partners seem to almost sense what the answer is. I'm sure most people know how the game is played, but just in case, here's the gist: There are several categories that come up randomly as you progress around the Pictionary board. Sometimes one person from each team draws (we make this rule apply all the time); otherwise one person draws and their partner guesses what their drawing means. The first person to guess before the timer runs out wins the round and that team rolls to go again. That's basically it anyway. I love this game and I highly recommend it for a good night of entertainment with friends and family
