 We have been building Lego sets with our children for over ten years. There isn't a Birthday or Holiday that goes by that doesn't include a Lego set...big or small. That said, the Star Wars Millenium Falcon has been the most challenging and fun to build to date (the Lego Castle of Morcia a close second). Construction of this 985 piece set was time consuming (about eight hours), but once completed has also been the most fun to play with. The Millennium Falcon's "roof" opens exposing control panels, an escape pod, turret, cockpit, and more. The set also includes Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO, and a Storm Trooper. This set is a perfect companion to the Tie Fighter (which comes with Darth Vader). I rated this product a 4 for durability not because the Legos themselves are problematic, but becuase when the Millenium Falcon is complete it is somewhat fragile.
