 I haven't had any problems with these ball pit balls. They are very soft, which I like for safety reasons. Very brightly colored and seem to hold there shape very well. We haven't had any of them crush or dent. The instructions say if they do dent, place them in hot water and they should return to their original shape. We're glad we purchased these. The only reason they only got 4 STARS is because of the price. $19.99 is too steep a price, expecially considering that 100 balls doesn't go very far. We bought 200 balls and it doesn't even cover the bottom of our small ball pit. You will definitely need a lot of balls to make for fun play. 100 seems like a lot, but don't be fooled. It's not as many as you think... Toys r us has 100 balls for $9.99, which is a MUCH more reasonable price, but I haven't purchased any yet, so don't know what they are like..
