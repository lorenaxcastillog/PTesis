 I love this game and would suggest it for any family gathering. It is possible to suggest a poor answer just to make a point to that ulltra-conservitive sister or that free spirit brother who needs to get a job. A great way to unite two families or a holiday event that would otherwise drag on. Put the kids to bed and invite their friends. I don't want to tell you more as if I was to be a reviewer of something what would I review? Then every one guesses. Accounting statements? Books? Pornorgraphic movies? Then I select the one I like the best. The play continues. Trust me and keep the kids away if you are really having fun
