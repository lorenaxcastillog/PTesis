 I find it annoying that preschoolers are so limited in what they are "supposed" to learn and know. Of course, this is because parents are encouraged to teach their toddlers the skills required for entrance to public kindergarten. At pre-K screenings across the country, 3-4 year olds are quizzed on basic shapes, colors, whether they recognize their first name, and a variety of other skills deemed "necessary" by their local or state board of education. While it's okay, and even necessary to a point, it also limits the free wheeling learning that a young child's mind is capable of. This puzzle allows a little child to enquire about shapes beyond just the Square, Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle. My little Claire loved them for tracing. They served as race cars. Do the contacts work 100% of the time? To be honest, I can't even tell you! I was not paying attention to that, as I was usually there saying the shape's name, if that's what we were doing, or if they were race cars, saying "vroom" or if we doing colors, saying the color name. So--great puzzle with lots of shapes, and multiple colors. Enjoy
