 Parents who judge education systems/software by ability to keep the attention of today's ADD children regardless of actual educational content may like this. They'll be the only ones though since there is no educational content. "I love birthday parties, yeah" - "They're here, let the party begin" - "oink oink". This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics "games" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless
