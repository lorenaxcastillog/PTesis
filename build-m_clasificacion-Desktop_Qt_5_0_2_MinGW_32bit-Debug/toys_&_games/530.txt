 My 4 year old daughter asks every day to have this Big Sister Dora for Christmas. I love it. She doesn't know I already have it hidden in the closet for her. She even drew an awesome picture of Dora holding both babies for Santa so he can get it just right. I loved this idea the second they came out with it. I love that it helps my daughter love her role in our family as "Big Sister." What a positive idea! Who doesn't need more excitement to help their child welcome a sibling into the world? I love too, that there are twin babies. My daughter is already planning to share one of the babies with her little sister. Although, we only have 2 girls at this time, they know that someday we can welcome a new little brother or sister into our family as well. I would highly recommend this toy. I mean, what little girl doesn't love Dora
