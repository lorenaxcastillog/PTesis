 Let me just get this off my chest. Ponies have hooves. They cannot even try to hold sundae dishes. So let's take the pointless accessories out of my review and carry on. I like this castle. Needs no assembly. We love the way the magic wand opens it up. The magnetic stage is a neat idea and my four year old can operate it easily. But just one more moan. Would it have killed them to include one pony? Like one of those pictured on the box? Thank goodness I pre-empted a situation of high drama and searched out the exact pony to purchase separately. Years of dealing with this sort of issue heightens a mum's awareness of inevitable disappointment. How dare you expect to get a pony! Here - have two spoons and a punchbowl instead!
