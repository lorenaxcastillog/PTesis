 I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon! After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water. IT IS NOT!!!! Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress. Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed. Beware of this seller! I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description. Believe me - it was there before
