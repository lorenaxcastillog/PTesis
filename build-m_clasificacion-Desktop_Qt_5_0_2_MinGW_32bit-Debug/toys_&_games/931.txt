 I really wanted a baby doll my daughter (14 months)could take in the tub with her and brush/wash her hair, etc. This is ok. It serves it's purpose...somewhat. The dolls hair is up in a band which I thought could just be taken out but it is actually "sewn" into her hair/head. So she can't really wash or brush the dolls hair. The water seat it comes with is also too difficult for a child to put the doll into. Not worth the money in my opinion, I wish I would have spent the extra money and gotten her a Gotz Baby Bath Doll
