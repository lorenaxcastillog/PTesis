 This toy is so cool I Just got one yesterday for my 13th b-day and it is cool.I took it to school and took a picture of all my friends and stored their number in it.My friend kiana is getting one right now as I type this her mom said this was so cool and that she needed to keep in touch with her kiana so why not.My teacher said this is a good toy but why do 13 years old need it it's bad enough you guys talk on the house phone. The whole class said because it's cool.Also I got the earpicece to go with it the earpicece did'nt work so well my mom took it back today after work.The earpicece kept falling out my ear and I could not hear well which made me mad.So who's ever reading this do not waste your money like I did .But if you want to gone ahead. I LOVE THIS TOY IT ROCKS THANK YOU HASBRO FOR MAKING IT ALSO YOU VIDEO NOW ROCKS TOO
