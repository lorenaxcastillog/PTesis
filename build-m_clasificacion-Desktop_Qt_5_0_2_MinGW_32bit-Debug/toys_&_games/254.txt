 My 4 year old really wanted this for Christmas, after looking at similar products, we chose this one. Should have spent the money on the one w/the DVD. Tutu is WAY TOO SMALL - fits her 18" doll. Mat is a little too sensitive, she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads. Only 2 instructions - feet up, feet down. On the other arms up, arms down. Bar isn't very stable. Company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat. My daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it.
