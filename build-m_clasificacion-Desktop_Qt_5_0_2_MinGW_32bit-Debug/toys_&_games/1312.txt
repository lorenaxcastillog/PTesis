 My son loves this guy. He is 3 and his 2 year old sister has dolls, dolls, dolls. He was so happy to have something of his own and my husband is happy it is not a pink baby with ringlet hair. It comes with a video (about 20 minutes long) all featuring Eddie and a cute backpack with the frog inside. It also comes with a comb that has a picture with a frog on it. Everytime he watches the movie, he holds his doll and screams "There's my Eddie!" everytime he sees him on TV. It was the joy of his Christmas. Good Buy
