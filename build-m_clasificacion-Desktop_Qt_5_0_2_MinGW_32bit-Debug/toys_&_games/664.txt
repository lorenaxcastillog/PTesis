 I just did another review on the Diego treehouse set as my twins decided to purchase this and the Deigo set. I will first say we purchased this for much less at a well known local store (not sure if I can say where). It is well made and my girls played with it for hours. They have decided to ask Santa for other pieces to go with this set. I have a whole basket full of Littlest Pet Shop items for them also through Amazon where I found these items to be comparable in price. You will not be disappointed in this purchase
