 My little sister and I love Barbie,My Scene,and Bratz.And ever since this came out,my sister wanted it.It's really expensive though.I mean,65 dollars?But luckly,we got ours at Wal-Mart.But as soon as my parents got it,it went on sale! Fun This toy was very fun.For both me and my sister.It comes with a vanity,bed(for kelly)A table,two chairs,and some pieces of cake and makeup.One thing you should know is that it is quite expensive for both the dolls and the cloud kingdom.All my sister got was the kingdom,Rayla the cloud Queen,and Brietta the Pegusus.But we play with our Bratz andMy scene.It can be for any type. Durability Ok.Everything is nice except for two things: 1.)The bacpart(Cardboard)is not a very good quality 2.)When you are done playing,take the3 pieces apart gently LGP3LN
