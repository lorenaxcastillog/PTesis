 I got this for my daughter and she has really enjoyed it. It came in about 5 pieces that weren't hard to put together, but you did have to make sure they were snapped together well. The little head came off the first time she played with it, but I found that I hadn't pushed it together hard enough. It hasn't fallen off again, yet. It is made for the Little Mommy dolls, which are 14" long and they work well with it. It even has a place behind the ears for the doll's hands to hold on. For the price, I thought it was a good deal
