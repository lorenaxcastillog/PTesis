 I am a college student who seems to have gotten by so far without the ability to manage numbers at all. Finally disgusted with myself and needing basic numeracy for jobs and school, I found this toy on sale one day. It allowed me to learn, then practice basic number skills, and teaches all the day-to-day math people need. I still remain shocked and horrified that I got through life thus far without knowing how to do things like calculate percentages in my head etc. but I am glad I decided to learn. I have a friend who is a math teacher and my scores on this toy were actually BETTER than hers, because she needed to rely on pen and paper whereas I was doing it in my head through this method. Only flaw---I wish it had the ability to save high scores, as it is now you must track it yourself...and a headphone plug would be nice. Otherwise though I really recommend this
