 This toy was given to my son at his baptism. At first he only liked the 'moon' side but now he smiles and grabs at the 'sun' side and loves to chew on it. It's stimulating enough for a preemie without being too flashy or overwhelming with noises. The rattle and squeaker are very gentle noises and they won't get on your nerves like some loud toys would. The colors are vibrant and beautiful and the material is is wonderful. It is so easy to wash which is great because my son would cry if he had to wait to play with Celeste! I recommend this toy for any mother and especially to mothers of preemies. This toy is worth it
