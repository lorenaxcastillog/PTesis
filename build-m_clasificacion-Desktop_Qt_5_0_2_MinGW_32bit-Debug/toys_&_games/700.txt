 This game came highly recommended as entertaining for a broad sweep of ages and a good "ice-breaker" game. We tried playing it with an 9 yr old and he was clueless about many of the descriptions. Spending time explaing them was tiring and not fun. If you don't already know one another, you're stricly guessing about their personality and there's not real payoff to be right. If you DO know the others, you'll find yourself walking a fine line between funny and hurt feelings. We LOVE Balderdash and Wise and Otherwise. Imaginiff is not a player among this group. I'd return it if I could
