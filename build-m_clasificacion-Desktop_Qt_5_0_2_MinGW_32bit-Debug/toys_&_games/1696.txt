 I got this for my son's 2nd birthday this week. I put it together alone in just a couple hours, PHEW! My husband is deployed, so I have had to do countless 2+ person jobs myself. I give it five stars based on my trust in the other reviews, plus... My son is big for his age (40lbs), so it seems that the frame is a bit loose. I hope all it will take is a little re-tighten after he goes to bed. But just like all the other reviews: my child saw it, got on it and hasn't stopped, but to get some water, food or fresh didee. He just loves it! Then so must I.
