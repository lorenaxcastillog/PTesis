 The Lil' Doll High Chair and matching cradle were a great hit as Christmas gifts for my grandaughter, age 2 yrs. 8 1/2 mos. She loves both, and two months later still plays with them daily. Her sister, age 5, also likes them; and the parents say these KidKraft toys are easy to assemble, sturdy, and attractive The cradle can be used as a magaziane rack by the girls when they are too old to play with dolls. I bought these because the white KidKraft table and chairs at my house are sturdy, easy to clean, and look great after 6 years of weekly use by one or more grandkids (boys and girls, ages now 2,3,6,and 8).
