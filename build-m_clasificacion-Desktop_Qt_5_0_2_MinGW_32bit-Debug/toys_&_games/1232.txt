 I really like this toy. It was a little difficult to assemble. I did have help from a college student who was visiting thankfully. The directions could be a little more informative. We almost packed it up and took it back. This will be perfect for the beach and boardwalk. It saves your back, teaches steering, and attracts a lot of attention. People think it is so cute. The other review was correct the visor does nothing. We use it at night and in the morning or indoors. At $84 dollars and some change it was a tough pill to swollow, but well worth it. I hope I can hand it down. Thanks college student/niece olivia's mo
