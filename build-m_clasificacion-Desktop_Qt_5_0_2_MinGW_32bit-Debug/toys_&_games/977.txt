 I LIKE THIS DOLL. IT PORTRAYS THE SWEET & WHOLESOME SIDE OF LINDSAY LOHAN. INSTEAD OF BEATING HER UP FOR HER BAD HABITS WHY DON'T WE JUST FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF HER LIFE & CAREER? (SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN "THE PARENT TRAP", "LIFE-SIZE", "FREAKY FRIDAY" & "MEAN GIRLS".)EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES YOU KNOW. NONE OF YOU ARE PERFECT EITHER. I GIVE THIS DOLL 5 STARS. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE LINDSAY WHEN SHE HAD RED HAIR. AND $14.99 IS A GOOD PRICE FOR HER TOO. I ORDERED ONE FOR MY COLLECTION. HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE. AND WHY DON'T WE ALL TRY TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT NICER? IT IS THE CHRISTMAS SEASON YOU KNOW. MAY WE ALL HAVE HAVE A SAFE, HAPPY & PEACEFUL! CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR! GOD BLESS!!!
