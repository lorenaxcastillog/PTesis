 I really like My first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son. I bought it for him for Christmas last year (he was 2 1/2 then)and though some the activities we're alittle hard for him to start with, there were still plenty of things he could do with it.Every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound,so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it. A year on,he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words,so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him,so he is still learning from this toy after a year! I will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this Christmas,this toy is worth every penny
