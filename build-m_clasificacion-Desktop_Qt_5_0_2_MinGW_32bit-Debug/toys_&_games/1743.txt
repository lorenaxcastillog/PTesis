 It is great, my kids (1 and almost 3) love it, we took it to grandma and grandpa's (because it folds absolutely flat and takes up NO space in the car) and everyone played in the bus. It was the perfect birthday present for my nephew (5)(because he had so much fun in it at grandma and grandpa's.) I continue to be amazed at the imagination of my kids for all the places the bus goes. Yes, it could probably be sturdier, but it has not ripped or torn. I do still wonder, as mentioned in one review, why we got 2 steering wheels and the extra toggels on the exit door in the back.
