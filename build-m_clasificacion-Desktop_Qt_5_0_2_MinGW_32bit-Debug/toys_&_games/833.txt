 I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She absolutely loves it. She has played with it every day since I bought it two months ago. The self-storage for the balls is great. The only complaint I have is that there's no way a small child can push the ball past the button on the top to get it to spiral down. She puts the ball in the top and wants me to push it through for her. That was fine the first thousand times, but it would be nice if she could do it herself
