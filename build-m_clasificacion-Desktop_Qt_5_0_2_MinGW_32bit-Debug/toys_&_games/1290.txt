 Like other reviewers, we got this toy as a gift. My son was only 6 months old, so we thought we'd have to wait a while for him to be able to play with it. He started playing with it right away. He'll play with it for hours. Yes, the football IS just a rattle that spins in the goalposts, but there's not much other than that that can be SAFELY done with a football. My 2-year-old daughter uses the baseball and bat part more than my son and it's really teaching her some baseball skills. As for it's size, look at the customer images. Someone placed a picture of their toddler seated playing with it. As you can see, it's roughly two feet tall. It's meant for infants and toddlers (NOT KIDS). If you want one of these for older kids, there's a great one on the market adjustable up to almost five feet.
