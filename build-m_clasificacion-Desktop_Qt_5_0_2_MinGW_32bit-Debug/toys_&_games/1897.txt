 This is the worst children's game I've ever seen -- bar none. I am a few months away from completing a PhD and I can't understand/remember the confusing directions... Can you imagine how frustrating it is for my 4 year-old and her friends? The game is so complicated and so devoid of fun that we have never finished it, and whenever we play it, everyone ends up unhappy. And ditto what everyone writes about the cheapness of construction and the pain-in-the-butt set-up. I hope Disney pulls this from the market -- it's so awful I am not even going to give it to Goodwill, I'm just going to trash it
