 This bench is really cute and my two year old son just loves it. He likes to sit on it, lay on it, hide toys in it's bins, and try to name the different colors. It was rather easy to put together and it pretty sturdy considering it's size. I would only suggest that you leave one side off during assembly and attach it last. This will avoid having to unscrew parts to fit in the pieces that attach with a dowel, etc. I give it four stars because it is a bit small. I would say it's about 2ft tall and 2 1/2 feet wide. I was hoping for more storage space and a bigger seat but for $30 I think it was worth it. And most important - my son loves it
