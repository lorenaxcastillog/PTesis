 I wish I could give this cube 5 stars! If it were based on how much our twins adored the toy, I would definitely give it a better rating! However, I feel the need to mention that we initially purchased this toy for our 6+ mos old twins and within a few months the battery cover cracked right next to the on/off switch, leaving the batteries easily accessible. Duct tape would not even keep the cover on securely, because the cover was under so much pressure from the batteries and springs underneath. When our twins were 1 1/2 we decided to put it on the Christmas wish list, because they both adored the first one so much. Much to our dismay, the exact same thing happened to the battery cover of the second one! What a huge disappointment! Obviously this toy has a manufacturing defect and I can only hope that Munchkin fixes it for future production of the toy. The concept is excellent and our twins really did love it, especially our very musical little girl.
