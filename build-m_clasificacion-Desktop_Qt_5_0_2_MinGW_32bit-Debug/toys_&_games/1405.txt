 We have been completely disappointed with this set. Our boys (ages 3 and 5) received it as a gift...and I certainly hope the purchaser didn't pay $20! The planets are flimsy plastic balls in two pieces. They are various sizes, but are NOT remotely to scale. The fishing line and tacks are tedious to assemble. Gift buyers should be SURE the recipients want to attach nine planets to their celing with tacks and extra adhesive putty (not everyone does!). We would much rather have a cool mobile where the planets could rotate around a sun (which is missing from this set). Ours is going in the trash soon
