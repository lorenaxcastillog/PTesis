 My mother-in-law sent this for my son this Christmas and it is such a hit. Definitely a toy for the thinking child. My son is 9 and although I do have to minorly assist him, he is absorbing everything. Products used in the experiments are replaceable with common household items--such a plus for us because once is never enough. This product seems extremely durable, too, with holders for all the tubes, beakers, etc. I did see that the guide was age-inappropriate (i.e. Why does my child need to know that so-and-so was an exotic dancer before coming on the squad?), so I had to give it an overall 4. I hate to do that, but this is a toy.
