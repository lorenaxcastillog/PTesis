 I bought this for my little Bub (14 months) and he loves it. He loves anything that has wheels and I picked this car because you simply had to shake it to make it go. After 7 or 8 shakes for optimum performance, this toy goes quite far. The only drawback is the lack of variety in phrases. I think it only has two. Anyway, the car is easily operated by my son and if the phrases start to drive me bonkers, I can switch it off and Bub still zooms all over with it. Bub is also very rough with toys (tossing and such) and so far, McQueen is doing very well
