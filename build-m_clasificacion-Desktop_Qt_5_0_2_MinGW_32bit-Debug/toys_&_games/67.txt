 Growing CPs from seed is not easy! And growing CPs in a terrarium is even harder (they need full sun, wet soil, and a special soil mix). They grow native from Texas through the Carolinas and do not need the tropical environment of a terrarium where fungus will attack and kill. This terrarium set up is doomed to failure. CPs are actually very easy to grow outdoors with a little proper instruction. Obtain your plants or seeds (takes years to get a decent plant via seeds) from a reputable online nursery (I have bought several excellent plants from Sarracenia Northwest) and then search the web for proper growing instructions.
