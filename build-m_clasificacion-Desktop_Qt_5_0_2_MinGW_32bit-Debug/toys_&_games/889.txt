 Yarrr! This game be ship loads of fun! Even me young daughter Grace (yes, named in part after Grace O'Malley) was able to sail the high seas. Unfortuneatly, I was her first target and was relieved of the burden of me entire booty by the third turn. We were rolling on the floor when one player was once again marrooned on Rum Runners island. Players made pacts, not in the rules...nor disallowed, they are more like guidelines... and consipired to block those players about to win. This game was fun from the time we left home port until we buried the booty. I recommend this game to everyone...we had no issues with scene delay in the DVD and the island challenges you play ellicited cheers (and jeers) of "YARRRR!" from all of the pirates sailing the board. The added dimension of fortune cards made it a risk to attack other ships, not to mentioned the black spot that lurks, even after you succesfully plundered a fellow pirates booty. Great game with many dimensions
