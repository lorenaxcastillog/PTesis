 We purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility, pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it
