 Both me and my kids have learned so much from this toy. We rarely start our children out on real items until they understand the fake ones first. Therefore, we have been slowly going over each inch of this toy and explaining the bits and pieces to our children. What fun! We even made a model of peach pillows to push the toy in and out of. It really taught them a lot. Eventually, we moved on to the art of touching and playing with it. It was really neat when we gave little Robert his first real piece to explore. He was so experienced! I believe it was because he had so much practice with the toy first! Thank you, 'Doggie Done It!' You really helped us learn to play with our poop as a family and now we truly are closer than ever before. If only Jimmy hadn't succumbed to that awful problem with dissentary, he could be here with little Robert and Josiah. Jimmy never was as talented as the other 2 with the quick regurgitation, which is necessary to avoid the ingestion of too much fecal matter, obviously. So buy this toy
