 The Buried Treasure playset, as well as the Haunted House, were bought as Christmas gifts for my 3 1/2 yr old son. Both my son and 1 1/2 yr old daughter love them! My son can play it by himself, but my daughter just pushes the car up and pushes the buttons to make the sounds. These are the first toys the 2 yr old boy I babysit plays with! My only complaint is that it doesn't work well with any other matchbox or hotwheels cars--only the cars it comes with. It's hard for the younger kids to understand that. Overall, the kids love it and it keeps them busy!
