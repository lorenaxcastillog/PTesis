 Yes, the case itself is made of the generric flimsy plastic that they used to make Halloween costumes out of back in the 80's. However, so far, I have not had any durability issues with it. The big selling point for me, though, was that it included two of the plastic trays to put the cars in. I first got a Hot Wheels car carrier made of solid plastic, but it did not hold the cars securely and while carrying the case, the cars would move around inside and scrape each other up. The removable divider trays in this case are perfect and do not allow the cars to move at all, even if you tip the case upside down. I highly recommend this portable case
