 My 6 year old daughter wanted this stuff so bad for Christmas. I saw the commercials and thought it looked great so I bought it for her. Within minutes, the stuff was everywhere. It doesn't really stick together as well and easy as the commercials show. It is very dry, so dry that it really doesn't bond, not even in the molds unless you really put some muscle into it. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because she enjoyed playing with it. Each time she plays with it, we have less and less. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. She likes Playdough better she says. Wish I had saved my money
