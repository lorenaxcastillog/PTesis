 This toy is a wonderful addition to the roll a round line, which up until this point consisted solely of a dinosaur, a gumball machine and a turtle, so it was certainly a welcome addition. The rounds that come with the toy are very cute, but not as as related to the toy as they normally are. For instance, the gumball machibe comes with candy themed balls. Still, the rounds are alwasy cute. As for the toy itself, it is very very cute. It is easy to pull or push or drag, and moves around quite easily. The only issue I have with it how easily the balls fall out, whcih frustrates my child, and i also believe that the pull string should be a bit easier to hold. all in all, a great to
