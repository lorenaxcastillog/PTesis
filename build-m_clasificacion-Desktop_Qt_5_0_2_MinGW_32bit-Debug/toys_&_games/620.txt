 As a child, I myself grew up with Candyland. Now that I have children of my own, my house wouldn't be the same without it. We got this game when my son was 3 and my daughter was 2. Both of the kids understand the concept of the game and enjoy playing it. The best thing about this game is that there's nothing really complicated. The kids don't even have to know their colors to play. They just need to match up the color on the card with the color on the board. The game is simple enough that the kids often win which makes the game more enjoyable for them
