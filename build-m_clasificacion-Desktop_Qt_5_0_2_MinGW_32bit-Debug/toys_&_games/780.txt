 We were given this as a gift when our son was about 5 months old. He has loved it ever since. First he would lay under it and kick at the toys, then we changed it so he could sit in a Bumbo seat and hit the toys, then we changed it so he could stand at it, now he is walking at 10 months and loves to walk over to it on his own. I think our son was an active guy and probably was destined to be an early walker, but I credit this toy with keeping him interested at many stages of his development and helping us to encourage his interest in standing. It has always been easy to change the set-up of this toy so that he is not bored by it. Whenever we have play dates with other babies, they love it too! After having it in his life for 5 months, he still loves to play with the buttons and rattles. I'm sure he'll continue to use it as he gets older as an art table or something. Highly recommended
