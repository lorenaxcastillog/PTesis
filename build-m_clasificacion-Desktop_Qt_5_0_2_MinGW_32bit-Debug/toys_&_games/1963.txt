 I have the single player game of this, but wished I had this version. I just loved both of these games on the Sega Genisis. head to head competition at a low price that is easy to travel with, a must have. The games still move just as fast, and the playability is still about the same. The graphics are pretty good remembering what the genisis was like, few details are harder to see. Also the names of the players are not there, but that is ok. This is a great combination. I just hope they put together a college football package, my alltime favorite EA game. Check this out, the price is dropping and you can't go wrong. This travels with me to play when I'm on call. Excellent toy for all ages.
