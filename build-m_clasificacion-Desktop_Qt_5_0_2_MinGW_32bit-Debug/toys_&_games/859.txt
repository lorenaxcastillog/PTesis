 This is a cute, easy game to play with. I bought this one for my son a few years ago and it is still a big hit. It is fun and keeps him giggling. He asked to play a few times in a row, because it is a short adventure. I think if your little one is scared of monsters in his room this helps ease his fear. When they happen to pick a monster out of the sack ...they say~ go away monster and pitch it into the box...and I make up little things to say when this happens. I highly recommend this game, not hard and really you don't need directions...explain it once and they have it. Great buy
