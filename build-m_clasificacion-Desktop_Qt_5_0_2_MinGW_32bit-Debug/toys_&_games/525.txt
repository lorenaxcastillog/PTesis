 We bought this shopping cart for my daughter's birthday to replace the cheapie one she'd had before. Her previous one had cost under $10 (a gift) and there is no comparison between that one and the Little Tikes one. The old one was flimsy from the get go, faded quickly, and when it broke, left sharp edges in the plastic. The Little Tikes cart is much, much sturdier and safer. I put it together in less than 30 minutes, even with my daughter's 'help'. There's a nice deep basket that holds a good amount of pretend play food or whatever else your child wants to push around. The seat for a doll folds against the cart just like a real shopping cart, and easily holds a good variety of different style dolls. The empty shelf under the basket is a nice touch, perfect for stashing more groceries. This cart is definitely worth the extra money, and I'd gladly buy it again
