 My 5 year old got this as a present and liked it. However, her 3 year old little sister plays it and enjoys it more. It does seem a little too simple for older ones but it is entertaining. Also, it can tend to get a little boring as you continue to play since it seems to take some time to finally win. Actually we have never played it till someone wins because they seem to grow tired of it before that happens. All in all, this is a good board game and it is fun to play...just maybe not till the end
