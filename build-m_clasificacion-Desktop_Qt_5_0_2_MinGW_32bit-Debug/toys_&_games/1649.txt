 I'll tell you. I had no idea what these things were when a friend of my daughters mentioned that she would like one for her birthday. Well, my daughter received one for a class Christmas present. WOW! These things provide hours of educational fun. Good grief. She has to work for W dollars and save up for food for her Unicorn. She can also save up for furnishings for her Unicorn's bedroom, toys, appliances, clothes, etc. She is having so much fun looking after her new Webkinz, that I have to ask her to leave the computer occasionally to give her eyes a rest. The arcade games are fantastic. My favorite is the trivia. Extremely rewarding and full of wonderful skills and facts to learn. What a great concept by Ganz. This will be a classic in no time. I would reccomend however, that the user have DSL or some other form of high speed internet to enjoy this product. Anyway, have fun
