 I don't know if this happened from using the hook to hang dry elmo, but now his neck is ripped half way around and stuffing falling out. We have been using this toy for about 5 months, since my daughter got it as a christmas gift. She really enjoyed the crayons and even coloring elmo. The crayons are still holding up and haven't worn down as fast as the other reviewers said. She did draw on our bathroom wall, though, which was a not too pleasant side effect of the tub crayons. We have a plastic tub and the crayons were not a problem as far as staining goes. Overall it was nice while it lasted
