 I purchased this Slide & Hide Tower for my 2 year old daughter. I just got done assembling it and I have to say one thing. I read the reviews about how hard or easy it was to put this thing togother and I was very nervous about putting it togother by myself. I am a 30 year old woman that assembled it on my back patio with my 12 year old daughter while my husband was at work and my little one was napping....using no tools. Done in less than 20 minutes! Simple! USE LOTS OF LIQUID DISHSOAP IN THE JOINTS! There is no possible way that anyone should have any issues with assembly. Feel confident when purchasing. Great quality. I cannot wait for my little one to wake up and try out her new slide
