 This game is great in the sense that just about everyone can play! We pretty much scrapped the rules it came with- they are written inanely and relatively useless. Instead, we modify each game to suit the situation we're in- so that we can play it while waiting in line at Disneyland and while we're at a party. It's a great way to "go back" to all the songs you didn't know you knew, and marvel at your friend's talents (or lack thereof) to mimic famous singers. If you get it for nothing but the word cards, it's still totally worth it
