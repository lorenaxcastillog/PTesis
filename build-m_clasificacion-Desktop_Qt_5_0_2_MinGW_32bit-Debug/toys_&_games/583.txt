 What makes this monopoly version special is the Large Tokens and the difeerent styles of houses and hotels. I love how they made the tokens bigger and heavier. The are also about four different styles of houses and hotels for a little variety in housing. The money holder has felt on it to make it a little more fancy then standard plastic and of course the case is metal instead of the standard cardboard box. Other than that it is the same game. The only complaint I had is that I thought looking at the tin on the shelf that it was a silver and gld colored tin, but it is only siver. The gold is only on the plastic around the tin.
