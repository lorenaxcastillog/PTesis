 I bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme. The planets are nicely done and look great. No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?! They certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep! We have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around which is now our SUN. I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink. BUT, the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive. We put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package. It gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!!
