 I got this cottage for my 14 month old daughter and she LOVES it. We keep it in the house and our daughter is in it every chance she gets. She likes to sit on the pre-made chairs and eats snacks on the little table, she also loves to talk on the included telephone which is too cute!!! For the price, this house is a great buy and she will be able to use if for a few more years. I was a little nervous about buying something so large on-line because I was afraid it would arrive broken but it arrived fast and in perfect condition and the free shipping from Amazon is such a great deal!!! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the flooring inside has deep grooves and if your little one is bare footed and playing in it for long periods, it can be painful on the feet. I resolved this issue by going to the home store and buying a small grey bathroom rug to match and pad the flooring. Now its more than perfect and we LOVE it!!!
