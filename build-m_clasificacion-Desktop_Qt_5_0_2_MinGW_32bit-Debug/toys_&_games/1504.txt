 We bought this game five years ago for our then 3 yr old son. Not only was it his favorite game, but it is now the favorite game of his little brother, who is four. In fact, he even plays it with his imaginary friend! The game is basically charades for kids who can't read yet. It's relatively non competitive. On each turn, a player spins the spinner, advances the number of spaces to a colored spot on the board, draws a card of the same color, then has to act out whatever picture is on the card (a bird, a flower...). It is great fun to play with your child-- hilarious what they come up with to "act out" on their turn. (Imagine a 3 yr old acting out a refrigerator!) Frequently we have to cheat and look at the card while they are acting, to make sure we can figure out what they are doing. Our whole family enjoys playing this with the little ones
