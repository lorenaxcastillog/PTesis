 Our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear for her birthday - unfortunatley, it doesn't work the way they claim. I hid it at one end of the house, my daughter began searching in the opposite end of the house and the transmitter said "You're getting warmer... (which obviously she wasn't...)". Half the time she just found the bear accidentally without it giving any hints at all - it just kept saying comments like "You're fun to play with" and other such statements, but nothing to help direct her to the bears location. She just ended up wandering around the house and the comments coming from the transmitter were mostly haphazard and had nothing to do with where the bear was located. So the "fun" lasted for barely 10 minutes. I would love to return it, but we already threw away the box... If your child wants this toy, I would highly suggest you try to guide her toward something else
