 I had one of these as a kid let me tell you it took alot of ruffness and it was the strongest wagon I have ever had. Now that I have kids they have one and its so cool how the sides come off so when even the kids get bigger you can have just the three sides on and have a bench. AS far as the paint coming off sure with wear but it is non-toxic. Plus any item paint wears off but you are not going to find a more durable sturdy wagon anywhere but Radio Flyer I am a loyal customer and will always be. We love this wagon
