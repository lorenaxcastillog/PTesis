 My son has had this toy for almost a year and has used the crayons every day since he got them. They are still about 1/2 of their original size! I was really surprised by some of the reviewers who said their crayons were melting away fast because I have been amazed by the durability of ours. Maybe they haven't been letting them dry out between baths?? My son has no problem getting them in and out of the little fishbowl. Only bad thing I can say is that although my son LOVES elmo the doll hasn't really captured his attention, and I'm absolutely sure that's just a personality issue with him. The doll is in great shape, still looks like it did when we first got it.
