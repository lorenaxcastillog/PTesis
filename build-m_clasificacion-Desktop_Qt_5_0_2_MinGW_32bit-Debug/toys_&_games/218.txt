 My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas. The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors! Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything. I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too! They should have made it that the "pen" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something. I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either. Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use
