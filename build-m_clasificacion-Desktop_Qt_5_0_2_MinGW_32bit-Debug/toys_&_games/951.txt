 I bought a pair of these when my daughter was 1 and had to climb up onto them. Now she's 2 1/2 and they fit her perfectly, yet are certainly strong enough to hold a parent who wants to sit down with their child. I disagree that they were easy to put together, but probably that is because all I had was a manual screwdriver and by the time you have screwed two-dozen or so screws into wood, it gets painful! Also, they might seem expensive, but the quality is worth it. These chairs will last for generations! I wish Amazon had carried them when I purchased mine. I paid about $20 more than their price and at that time that was the best price I could find
