 I read about this RC racer in Family Fun magazine and it got best toy for 10-12 age group and they were Right! It is alot of fun to put together..not too hard, but a good challenge...It can also be made into a different model,we went online to lego and got the directions. It is also sturdy, maneuvers, speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds of terrain including snow jumps. The battery has given us about an hour of hard driving.The remote is alot of fun to use. I loves it...its spendy, but I've already had hours of fun
