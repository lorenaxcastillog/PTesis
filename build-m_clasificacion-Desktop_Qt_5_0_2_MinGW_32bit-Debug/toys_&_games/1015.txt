 We love this train table and the train set that it comes with. It has everything you need for hours of fun. This was a Christmas gift for our 21 month old and he literally spent all of his free time (when we weren't eating or opening other presents) Christmas day playing with this table. And so far it has proven to be very durable. We know this because now my son loves to do nothing more than to sit or try and stand on this table to play. The 3 bins that store underneath are wonderful. They are large and make for very easy clean up at the end of the day. We highly recommend this train table!
