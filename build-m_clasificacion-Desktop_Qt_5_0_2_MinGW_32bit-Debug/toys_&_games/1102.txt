 This toy has made my summer SO fun. I got three of these two weeks ago and what a two weeks thats been. My friends come down to my pool and we have fights with the built in water guns.Sometimes we pretend to be James Bond and run in and jump on them. Also we sometimes take them to the beach and go around on them.This toy is good for children ages 6 through 10. It says it can hold up to 80 pounds but I've been on them and I weight 110. Even my dad has been on it but he went really slowly. Over all I think this toy is great for any pool,lake,or beach. - J.P. 12,MA
