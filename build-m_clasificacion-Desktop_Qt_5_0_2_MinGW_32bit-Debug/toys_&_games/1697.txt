 i bought this from toys r us and i must say i was very happy with it compared to some other similar toys that were there. this was bought for my sons 3rd b-day, this was his favorite present and he had no trouble learning how to play with the toy after i showed him how it worked. i wish they had different versions of this truck maybe a gas truck and an actual closed end trailer to store the cars! well any how after i read these posts about it being a bad toy i had to defend it because my son loves it like a stuffed animal!
