 We just bought this for our three year old granddaughter for Christmas. (she will be four in January). She loved it. She also has a little brother (1) and it was something that she could do all by herself while mommy had to feed brother. The biggest hit was she had her video game just like daddys. The only problem that we have found with it is we can not find the key that they talk about on the package to get more games. This is troubling because other video games now come with two keys . Dora you have to buy the key seperate and not everyone has them not even toys r us. But I would still buy this Dora game .My granddaugther loves it.
