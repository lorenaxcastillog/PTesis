 My son got this set for his third birthday and he LOVES it. It's our first "real" Thomas train set (we have track from Ikea and from BJ's) and it *is* a lot nicer than the other brands. The wood track has railroad ties etched on it and the straight track flips over to reveal roadway. My son loves Thomas and this set keeps him busy for hours. My son's favorite part is that Thomas can go under the bridge (on our cheaper tracks the bridges are much lower). He also loves to move the Conductor's gate up and down to keep Thomas from passing. The trains and track in the Thomas Wooden Railway collection are durable and beautiful. My son also got the "Water Tower Steam Set" (an electric Thomas set) for his birthday but he chooses this one over that every time. It uses his imagination and keeps him involved and absorbed the way no other toy can
