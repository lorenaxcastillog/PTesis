 We bought this game for our 10yr old cousin for Christmas and it was a big hit !! We were so thrilled to hear from his mother who thanked us over and over again and told us how much he loved it. He had recieved Apples to Apples from Santa and had played it everyday until this arrived in the mail. It is now his new "favorite" game. It is so hard to shop for kids in this age range, and this, in my opinion, makes a great gift for older kids. It beats video games, and toys that are tired of easily and promotes quality time spent with family and friends
