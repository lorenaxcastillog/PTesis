 The game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults. This makes it great game for the whole family to play together. The images from the &quot;I Spy&quot; book illustrations are bright and creative. They don't match exactly- for instance, there might be two images of cats, but borrowed from different photographs in the I Spy books. So there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up. This is a much more attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift for a child or family
