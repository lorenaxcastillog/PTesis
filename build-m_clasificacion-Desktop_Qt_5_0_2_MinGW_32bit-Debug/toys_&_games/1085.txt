 My boys (6, 4, and 2) love everything pirates...especially playsets and figures. I think the tiny size of these make them even more fun. Despite its small size, this playset does a lot. The treasure chest sides can pull out and be configured in different ways. There are tiny settings for each of the major parts of the movies (the island, the building with the wheel, the port, the kraken, etc.) There are little boats, crates for the docks, a jail with barred doors that open, a boat launcher from the dock, a magnetic whirlpool area, the kraken, etc. Because it does so much, some of the pieces do come apart, but I think they are pretty easy to put back together. There are a lot of small pieces, but the best part is that everything fits back in the treasure chest for storage
