 We got this for our son's 1st birthday. He understands the concept of putting the pieces back in the puzzle but he usually thinks it's more fun to take one puzzle piece in each hand and bang them together like cymbals. The only negative thing I can really say about this is that for some reason the puzzle we got is really tight fitting, unlike the two other Melissa & Doug puzzles, one which was bought at the same time as this one. So that creates a little bit of frustration sometimes for my little toddler. But they're each cut by hand (with the proper equipment of course) so each puzzle will vary. -knobs are perfect size for little hands -colorful and attractive -sturdy, well-made -large pieces (easy to find when your toddler takes them to other parts of the house
