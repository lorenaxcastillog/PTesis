 I bought this desk for my daughter's fifth birthday. Her Christmas toys are already forgotten, but this art desk is used every day. The desk and chair are designed to be compact, and they fit easily in a bedroom or family room. It is more visually appealing than the art desks that are bulky and made of plastic. The top of the desk is very spacious and provides plenty of elbow room. (Two children can even use it at the same time.) I debated buying an easel, but this desk can be adjusted into different positions to resemble an easel, and the surface of the table becomes a chalkboard. If you lay the desk flat, you also have an ideal surface for working puzzles or working a child's laptop computer. Assembly is fairly easy. Just be sure to use a drill, instead of the provided wrench to cut your time in half. If you are frustrated at spending money on toys that never get played with...this is an awesome purchase!!!!
