 Hi! My name is Martine Redman and I'm the inventor of the I Spy™ Memory Game by Briarpatch. I've given this game to a lot of kids, and it's great to hear parents report back to me that the kids play it over and over. We've won a number of awards for it, including Parents Choice Gold Seal, the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal, Teacher's Choice, and many more. Best of all is the fun I have playing I Spy Memory Game with kids, who give the game the ultimate compliment, &quot;Let's play it again!&quot; Other award-winning Briarpatch games include the Goodnight Moon Game for ages 2 1/2 to 6, and the Maisy™ Game for ages 3-6.
