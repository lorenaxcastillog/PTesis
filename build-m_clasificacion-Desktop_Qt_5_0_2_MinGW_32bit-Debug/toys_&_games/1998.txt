 I recently bought this for my son's birthday. I went ahead and let my 5 yr old and his friends open this gift at the party. It really was just like playing with barely damp sand. It would clump together, but not very well. The kids had a great time but there wasnt a place that this sand didnt get into. It was stuck in shoes, in the cracks of the dresser, it got in food, it got in other toys. It literaly was everywhere! I wish you guys could see the carpet. I felt so bad for the people cleaning up after us that I left a bigger tip then i would have. Some parents even warned their friends on the phone to never buy this stuff. My poor kiddo was kind of upset when i wouldn't let him bring it home. Thanks for nothing. Every parent in the group agreed that they will never buy this product for their kids.
