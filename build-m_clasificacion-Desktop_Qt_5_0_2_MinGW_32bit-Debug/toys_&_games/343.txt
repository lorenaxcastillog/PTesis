 I am confused by the poor reviews of this product. My daughter received this toy from the Easter bunny this year and the whole family plus Grandparents/Aunts/Uncles etc. have had a ball with it. It creates huge bubbles round or long, that float in the air for quite a bit of time. I do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work...but for the price I have to say this toy is WELL WORTH IT! We also made our own solution (Granny's recipe) and it worked...very messy and sudsy though. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles
