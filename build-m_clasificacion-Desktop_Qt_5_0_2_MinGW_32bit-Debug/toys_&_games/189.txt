 I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas. We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together. He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan. He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated. It would not stay together. THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!! The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together. He lost interest and left. I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute. But, no way would they ever all fit together. Do not waste your money on this. I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too. Yea for cheap imports. The USA is so much better off for them???????
