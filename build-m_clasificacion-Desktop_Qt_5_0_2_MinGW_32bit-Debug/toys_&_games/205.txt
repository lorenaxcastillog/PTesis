 My wife and I purchased the VIDEONOW XP Interactive Video System for my son this Christmas however when we did Walmart was out of the headphones. Well I was on Amazon one day and decided to look here. I ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived. My 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders. No matter how we tried that is all they would do. My 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result! I am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose. These are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse. I would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child. If Tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device
