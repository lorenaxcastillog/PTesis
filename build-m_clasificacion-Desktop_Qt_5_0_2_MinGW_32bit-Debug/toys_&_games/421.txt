 This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals. The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos. I got this for my nephew and he likes it. It keeps him entertained. One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality. Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair. I wish we could find good quality plush anymore. I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have. I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair. So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive
