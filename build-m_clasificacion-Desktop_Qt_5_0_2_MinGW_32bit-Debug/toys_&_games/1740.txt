 We bought this item for our daughter's birthday because she loves Schoolhouse Rock. After opening it and playing we discovered it was just the songs and one game? When you read about what is offered it says "games", we only found one on the whole thing, guess we misunderstood the whole principal of the cartridge. I ended up returning it because if I wanted her to watch the videos I would buy the Schoolhouse Rock DVD, which we did. Anyway, thought we should share this because when you read about it you expect games that have to do with the songs?
