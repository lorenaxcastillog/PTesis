 We love the racing around one, but they do sell other versions, like dinosaurs and other ones. This thing floats and holds other toys on it and is the best bath toy we have had and we had many since this is my fourth kid and oldest is now almost 13! It is shaped to accommodate the body in the middle when its in front of you. Bath after bath it still looks new. The squirt toys are better than most. My problem with squirt toys is when you don't get all the liquid out, you get slime with the liquid when it finally comes out, and it gets the kids upset to see this in the tub. These do better than most. It covers transportation in general, but no trains, just police and fire vehicles and stations and airport and boat. This was for a 2 yr old. He asked where the train was, not sure why no train. I would buy these for gifts. The price is reasonable. Even my 7 year old wants to use
