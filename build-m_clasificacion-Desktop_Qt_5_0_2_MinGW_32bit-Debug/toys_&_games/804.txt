 The Playmobil products are nice and fun, BUT you must realize that every single piece of every single object comes apart. The hair pieces come off of the pilot and stewardess's head; the wheels come off, the airplane door comes off; the wings and tail comes off in many different pieces; the steering wheel comes off; and, there are many small pieces inside which you will never find after you child plays with it once. I would LOVE this product if I could get it to stay in one piece. I used the strongest glue I could find to keep the pieces in their respective places, but to no avail. The other Playmobil products are the same way. My 4 year old loves this plane, but he is also frustrating by having lost most of the little pieces. Such a disappointment
