 When my son got this for his first birthday I didn't think much of it because it didn't seem as interactive as other toys - but six years later we still have it and number two is loving it as much as number one did. This is the toy that outlasted all the others - every kid who comes over loves it and many of their parents have gone out and purchased it because their kids had so much fun with it. This won't be one of those toys that you spend a lot of money on and then find hidden in the back of the closet. It works for a wide range of kids - first they love just banging with the hammer and watching the cars spin; later it's fun to experiment with the steps and catapult. Watching stuff fly through the air gave my kids hours of fun
