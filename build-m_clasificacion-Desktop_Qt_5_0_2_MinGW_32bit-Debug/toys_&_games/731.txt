 I am pleased that other people have found this calculator useful. However, I cannot recommend it. I see two major problems with it. The most obvious is the very poor quality of the screen. The lines that make the digits and math symbols are too thin, too light, and very hard to read. I cannot understand why they would make a calculator for young children with such a truly terrible digital display. The cheapest calculator on the rack at the drug store has a better display than this one. The second problem is that it gives the answer to division problems as decimals rather than as remainders. There *are* calculators that give remainders instead of decimals. Such a feature would be suitable for such a calculator as this one, which is clearly designed for the early grades. The concept behind this calculator is a great one. The calculator itself, however, is poorly designed
