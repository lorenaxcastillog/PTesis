 My family has been taking an annual overseas vacation for many years. We have been all over. My wife and I try to educate our two children about the places they will see before we get on the plane. Geography is one important aspect of this, and my children have learned an immense amount about the world from the global puzzle. We have posted the puzzle up on my daughter's wall and have painted a dot of red nail polish on every country that we have visited. We still have a long way to go, but the global puzzle is guiding us. I definately recommend this puzzle
