 This tea party game was the favorite Christmas present this year. My daughter just turned 3 and loves this game. We can not go through a day without playing it several times. The table cloth is so cute and "girly". The pieces are very durable and well coated to avoid damage from a small spill. One time through the game, and my daughter had the rules down pat. (She still has some trouble with Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land etc., but picked this game up with no trouble at all.) Another great perk of the game is that my 3 year old can set the game up and pick it up all by herself! I would highly recommend this game for any young girl, especially if she is even slightly prissy. It is so cute, even I couldn't wait to play
