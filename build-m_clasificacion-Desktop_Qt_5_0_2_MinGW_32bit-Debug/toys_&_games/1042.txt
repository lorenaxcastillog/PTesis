 Melissa & Doug wooden toys and puzzles are wonderful! They are simple and durable allowing room for your child's personal imagination and creativity without spinning your child into over-stimulation mode as so many toys can do today! They have so many neat puzzles for various ages of development, and this rack is the perfect way to keep them organized and stored efficiently. There are also wooden puzzle racks available, but this wire rack is the least expensive and it does the job! You can store one of the thicker Melissa & Doug Puzzles (like the ones that make noise) on top of the rack, since they are too thick for the slots
