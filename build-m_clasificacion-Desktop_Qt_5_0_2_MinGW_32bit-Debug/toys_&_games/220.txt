 I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product. They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke! You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place? The whole thing is made terribly. It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks. None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it. Bottom line: this was a complete waste of money
