 This is a great product as long as your child will not put it in their mouth. It is a choking hazard. That said, it does not stick to anything even the carpet. If your kids can keep the colors separate it will work even better. But like playdough once the colors combined you have a multicolored ball that you cannot separate. Unlike play dough though it never hardens. I have a clump of foam just sitting on my coffee table waiting for my son to finish what he started when he comes home from school. I find that if you make little skinny peices, like a snake, you can bend them into letters and numbers. Which turned out to be good practice. My 4 yr old made his name. My five year old makes space ships and flies them around. We also play guess that shape with it. And like another reviewer said, this product is great for long car rides and for when they are waiting in a restaurant for their food. This year all the kids in the family will be getting this product for Easter
