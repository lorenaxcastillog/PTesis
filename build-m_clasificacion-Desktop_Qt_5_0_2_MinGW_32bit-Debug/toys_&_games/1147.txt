 My daughter has enjoyed this doll for over a year now, and the doll has never shown any sign of mold or mildew. We use it in the pool and the tub. There are small holes in the doll's heels that allow any water to drain from the body. I hang it over the tub nozzle so that water will drip in the tub and air will flow around all sides of the doll. We have only used the float and shower in the pool, and that may be where they work best since the water is deeper. To fill the fish with water we simply keep it attached to the tube and sqeeze the fish while holding it under water. My daughter likes to bath this doll with real soap at home and "pretend" soap at the pool. It has been very entertaining for her
