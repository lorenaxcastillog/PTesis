 One of my daughters received this as a gift and I couldn't wait to play it with her. There are four categories of questions: Breed, Riding, Horse Care, and Anatomy. As players move across the board, they choose a question from any category. As some of the reviewers said, some of the questions are extremely easy. However - some are very challenging. I say this as someone who has been riding for 35 yrs and who has owned horses. For example, one question is "Mares come into season: (a/ 21 days during spring and summer, b/21 days during fall and winter, c/41 days during summer and fall) (correct answer is "a"). An easier question: True/false: you must always wear a helmet with a chin strap when you are jumping a horse (true). There are 200 questions in all; I seriously doubt anyone would find it entirely too easy or entirely too hard - there are a good mix of difficulty levels
