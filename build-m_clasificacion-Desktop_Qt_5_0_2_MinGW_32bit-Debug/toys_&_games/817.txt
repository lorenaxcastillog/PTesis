 THIS WAS GIVEN TO MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BY HER SISTER FOR CHRISTMAS. THE MICROPHONE BROKE PUTTING IT TOGETHER. I COULDN'T FIND RECIEPT SO CUSTOMER SERVICE MADE ME PAY 5.00 TO SEND A NEW ONE WHICH TOOK ABOUT 8 WEEKS!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT THROUGH LITTLE TIKES WHICH EXPLAINS THE POOR SERVICE WE GOT, NOT TO MENTION THAT THE CUSTOMER SERV. REP. ACCUSSED ME OF HAVING IT FOR MONTHS AND JUST WANTING TO GET A NEW MICROPHONE. THE STAND IS USELESS IF YOU MOVE IT THE BOTTOM COMES APART OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!HOWEVER, MY LITTLE GIRL DOES LOVE THE KEYBOARD WITH ALL THE DIFFERRENT MELODIES AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS ETC.. SHE LOVES SINGING AND I LIKE THAT IT MAKES HER HAPPY UNTIL THE BASE COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM. IT HAS A CARRY HANDLE (TO BE USED WITH OUT BASE) BUT IT IS A BIT BULKY FOR LITTLE HANDS TO CARRY AROUND. I SAY THE COMPANY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE STAND/BASE ON THIS PRODUCT.
