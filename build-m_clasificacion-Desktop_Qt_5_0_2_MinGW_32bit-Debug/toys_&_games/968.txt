 We bought this for our two-year-old daughter, who loves sports, for Christmas. The very first time we played with it, our nine-year-old son was demonstrating it to our daughter, and he broke the stand! Now granted, nine-year-old boys can be tough on anything and everything, but he was actually being (relatively) gentle for the purposes of the demo. I think he had his foot on the base when he hit the ball (and the tee) but that is still a topic of debate. We still use it for t-ball, which is fine since our daughter still has some time before she can hit a moving ball. But I am disappointed in the quality, as we've had always had excellent luck with Little Tike toys. Fortunately, its still a good price just make sure older siblings (and Dads) are cautious not to stand on the base or hit the tee when they make contact with the ball
