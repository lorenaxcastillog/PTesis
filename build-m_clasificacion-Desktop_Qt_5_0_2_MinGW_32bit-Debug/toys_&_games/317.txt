 Sooo cute. Santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game. She and I have already spent several hours playing with her "pets". Unlike the earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet. There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends. There is a whole village of homes and places to visit. You collect stickers throughout your adventures. For instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends. It is represented by a heart sticker. Everytime you collect a sticker, you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained. There are three exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet. When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming, playing or eating. Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable. My daughter thinks that is hilarious. Kids! The only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark. Maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions
