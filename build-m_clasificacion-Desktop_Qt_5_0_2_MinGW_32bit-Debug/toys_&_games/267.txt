 I thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first. This was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week! She enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them. She also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She still loves it months later. The only downside to any toy like this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house.
