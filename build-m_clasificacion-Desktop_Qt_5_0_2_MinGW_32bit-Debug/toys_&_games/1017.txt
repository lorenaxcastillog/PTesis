 My son who is 5 is interested in learning baseball so we decided to try this for the pitching aspect. He had a tee-ball set but needed to move up to the next level. This is exactly what we needed. Instead of pitching the ball to him, which I'm not too good at, I now can help him with his form and the machine does all the pitching perfectly. It also has been a help with his catching. He stands in front of the machine with his glove and catches the balls as they pop out. I recommend this as an introduction to anyone interested in baseball
