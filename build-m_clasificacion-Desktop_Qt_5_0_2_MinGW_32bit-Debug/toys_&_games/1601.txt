 This is a must if you have the Geotrax starter set. My son received the basic Tracktown Railway at 2 1/2 and we immediately went out and bought him elevation track packs. Adults have to set the layout up, and its a little bit trickier in 3 dimensions, but the elevation is what makes Geotrax way better than any other train set! Only drawback is that you can't just buy one elevation track pack. This one would be the most logical buy if you do only buy one set though. It has ramps to get up to level 2, but this is much more fun if you get up to level 3. I would recommend adding the Ramps to this set. We have 1 of each of the 3 elevation packs and that's enough to connect all the elevation accessories we have (clock tower, suspension bridge, mile high mountain). Definitely add to your Geotrax, its worth it! Your child will love it and so will yo
