 I bought this toy for my three-year old son. I wanted something portable for traveling. I thought about a portable DVD player but the problem is they need to be charged after a couple of hours. I searched and searched and finally discovered the VideoNow Jr. It takes regular AA batteries which means I simply have to carry an extra supply of batteries with me and never have to worry about charging it. And the best part is, my son absolutely loves it and it keeps him occupied for long periods of time. The screen is very small, but this hasn't bothered him. I've had this for well over a year and can attest to its durability. There is one tiny down-side of this product. You have to use a small screw-driver to change the batteries which means you can't change the batteries on long plane rides as most airlines wouldn't allow you to carry on a screw-driver. So far though, this hasn't been a problem. The batteries seem to last a really, really long time
