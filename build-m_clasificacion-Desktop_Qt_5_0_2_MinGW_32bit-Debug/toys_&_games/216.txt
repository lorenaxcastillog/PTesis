 I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music. As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position. I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this. I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them). The dollar store has better toys than this. The sound is horrible and uncontrollable. The controls are worthless. I'm returning it today, and good riddance
