 I cannot believe Radio Flyer put this bike out! Every single time my 2 year old got on this thing, it toppled over! I actually called Radio Flyer, they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model (then I found out there are plenty of angry parents out there!) After some resistance, they agreed to refund me and they did. The back wheels are too close together, making it very easy to tip over, plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable. I tried it too in the store on smooth ground, but on the sidewalk, forget it! Please save yourself the trouble!
