 I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products. My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter. The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment. She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest. Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside. It just doesn't rock much. I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it. The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.
