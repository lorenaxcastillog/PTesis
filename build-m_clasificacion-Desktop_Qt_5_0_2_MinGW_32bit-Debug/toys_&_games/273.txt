 I had a Radio Flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it, which is why I wanted one for my daughter. We bought ours when our daughter was a year old, and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it. Now that she's four, she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around, or posing for pictures with him in it. We use it for picnicing in the local park, or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn. The wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos, from the Labor Day block party to Halloween trick-or-treating. It's a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason--kids love it, and never stop loving it
