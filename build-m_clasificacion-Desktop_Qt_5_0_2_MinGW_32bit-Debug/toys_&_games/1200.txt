 We bought this for our son when he was about 13 months. He loved pushing the buttons (numbers) and colored animals to get the toy to talk to him. He learned his numbers from this toy! He is now 18 months, and can reliably pick any number the toy asks for or I ask for. He also knows the animals and colors of them. The toy has 3 or 4 different settings that ask for different things, such as "find the number 5..." or "which animal says "Moo"?", or "find the orange cat". It will respond with the animal sound, and the voice saying" this is the orange cat". Our son gets them all every time! We haven't used the Spanish setting, though our son loves to flip to it, and then he has NO idea what the voice is saying, but he keeps doing it anyway! Great toy, well worth the money
