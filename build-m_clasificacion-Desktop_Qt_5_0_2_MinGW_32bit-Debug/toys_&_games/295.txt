 All year long, my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for Christmas. 3-weeks before Christmas, she sat on Santa's lap at the mall and asked for a TRUMPET of all things. I immediately came home and searched online. Everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them, but none of them looked real! And I'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting Santa to bring a real trumpet, so I found this, ordered it and it was here BEFORE the estimated delivery date! It is extremely lightweight (cannot be used as a weapon), each button has a different tone to it AND it looks real (besides the fact that it's not brass). She loved it! She plays it all the time and unbelievably, it's not the most annoying toy she has. I would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments
