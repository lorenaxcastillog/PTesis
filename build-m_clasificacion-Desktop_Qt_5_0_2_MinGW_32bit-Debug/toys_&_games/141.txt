 We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift. What a nightmare. First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better. This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it. It cuts NOTHING. This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something. It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle. The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch. There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together. We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking! The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING. My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic.
