 My six-year-old daughter received it as a Christmas gift and absolutely LOVES playing with it! Everyone else in the family loves playing with it too, including her older brother. Hers came with the Mom, Dad, twins (one boy, one girl), an older sister, a cat, and some furniture. She also received some of the furniture as gifts, and it definitely helps to have them when playing with the house. The dollhouse is really easy to store because the sides can fold up when playtime is done! One drawback to the dollhouse is that the rooms are small, so if you have a lot of the furniture for the dollhouse, not all of the pieces will fit in the rooms. However, there are creative ways to play with all of the furniture. I would definitely recommend this as a dollhouse to purchase for a child who is five or older
