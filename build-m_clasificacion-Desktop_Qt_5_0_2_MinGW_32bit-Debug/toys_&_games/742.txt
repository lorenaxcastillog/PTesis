 What can you say about an engine who manages to get cheerful little Toby mad at her! Mavis is a young, feisty diesel whose inexperience frequently gets her into trouble. That said, she *is* learning; and certainly after she shows her usefulness, she becomes one of the crew. (Even though she is a Diesel they don't hold that against her.) Like all of Thomas' friends Mavis is sturdy and a great pal. She is also very useful in the development of 'made up' Thomas tales. In appearance Mavis is black with the yellow markings around her square face. In addition, and for reasons unexplained, she has sidebars and a cow catcher which is certainly not standard quarry attire. It does mean, however, that she can substitute on Toby's line from time to time. Four stars. Mavis is a nice, second-string engine
