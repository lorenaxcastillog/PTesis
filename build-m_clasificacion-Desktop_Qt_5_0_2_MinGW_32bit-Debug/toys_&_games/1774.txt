 Good toy, but not many bubbles. This looked like a good outside toy for the money. The bubble solution does seem to stay in for the most part - unless they really work at trying to spill it out & then only a little comes out. But I have yet to see many bubbles be blown - I've tried & my 12 yr old has tried & we could only get wimpy few to fly. He quickly became uninterested when he couldn't impress his younger siblings. We have also tried different bubble solutions. No worries to my 22 month old she thinks its great to carry around & likes putting the wands in & out. I'd say it is very durable, educational (learning coordination inserting the wands - for the little ones)And is entertaining to the little ones as well. No regrets - we like this toy, but would be better if we could really blow some bubbles! :
