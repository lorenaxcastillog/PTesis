 This is the first game I've tried by the venerable Reiner Knizia. I was really taken in by the combination of simple rules, but interesting strategy. Since then, I've purchased several of his games. For those who like Lost Cities, but also have a soft spot for Poker, try Battleline. Samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated world of "tile games", with Tigres and Euphrates being the much more complicated cousin (although again, the rules aren't that complicated...the difficulty comes via strategic decision making.) So far, my all time favorite Knizia game...and frankly, one of my favorite games period, is Modern Art. The game mechanics are fairly simple, easily explained in 5 minutes, with some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game. Essentially, it's a game about playing an auction...who is the best at playing the market, guessing at art values, and spending money wisely. It's also a true crossover game... non-gamers, or those only exposed to the standard Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, etc, will quickly learn how much fun it can be... and will probably be asking to play again
