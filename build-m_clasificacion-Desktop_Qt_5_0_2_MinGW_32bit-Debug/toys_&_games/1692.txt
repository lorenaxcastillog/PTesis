 I gave this game to my 5 1/2 year old niece for Christmas and it was a smash hit! The rules were easy for her to understand, the board was easy for her to read, and she loved putting on all the jewelry and crown as she won them. The game moves quickly and Mom and the aunts were able to play along with her while still holding conversations and her 12 year old brother even played a few rounds (he did refuse to wear the jewels, however)! The great thing was that she could even play it by herself when no one else felt like playing. I have two criticisms: (1) the stickers were hard to put on the box and the crown and (2) the pink colored ring is more red than pink, and the purple ring is so dark it looks like the black one, which is the "old maid" in the game that a player does not want. Otherwise, this is a great game for a little girly-girl that loves frou-frou that teaches working towards a goal in a fun way.
