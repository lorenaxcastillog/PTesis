 My youngest son is an avid Bob the Builder fan and that was the gift theme for him last Christmas. We bought this and the chainsaw set and they were both a waste of money. This particular set falls apart easily and folding it up to put away is near impossible. Nothing aligns properly and the spare pieces fall out the entire time your trying to wrestle it shut. The die cast vehicles are too heavy to use with this toy and after attemping to play with it a few times, our kids gave up. The track snaps togther well, but that it the only part of this product that was useable
