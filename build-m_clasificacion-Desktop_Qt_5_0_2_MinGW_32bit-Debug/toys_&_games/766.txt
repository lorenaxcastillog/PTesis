 We've purchased this as a complement for the Bulk Tub, and both sets completely fit in the tub, so we use the bucket to store other toys in the bathroom. These are large duplo pieces, the smallest about an inch square, great for babies starting 6-9 months old. The comments I made for the bulk tub apply, and I highly recommend these for the versatily and creativity. You can make anything out of them, you're only limited by the number (both sets are enough for quite a lot) and by your imagination (I've made, trucks, boats, castles, even a cathedral). It provided great long hours of fun with my daughter now 3 years old. I expect it'll do so until she's at least 6, at which point we may switch to other smaller but more challenging toys (like the reggular legos)
