 My daughter wanted this for Christmas more than anything. But the doll is very difficult to use. Suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason. Then suddenly she'll come back to life later. She "grows" almost instantly. Despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button. I reset her constantly. Getting her to do all of the fun "big girl" things she is suppossed to do is frustrating for my five year old. Essentially, I have spent more time fiddling with Suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her. And the face paint came off almost immediately. Even with the small amount of time that she has been working. Perhaps when my daugter is a little older, she can spend time fiddling with her. She does play with her as just a "baby doll" so it hasn't been a total waste. But I certainly didn't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that don't work. Oh, and sometimes I'll walk into my daughters room and she'll suddenly "wake up" and start saying MaMa. Very horror movieish.
