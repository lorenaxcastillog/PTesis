 Great size, good quality, attractive primary colors, smooth edges and stack beautifully. Given to grand-daughter for 1st birthday along with the Uncle Goose Wagon and set of blocks and she plays with these on a daily basis. Loves to have someone stack them up so she can tumble them over and then laughs and giggles. She can build her own towers too! Imagine these will be played with for a very long time while many of the other toys from the October birthday are long forgotten. She loves "chewing" on the blocks but they do not splinter, come apart, chip or anything else as she continues to get the baby teeth in! Adults like playing with the blocks too...see all sorts of messages arranged with them that I know Abby did not do in spite of her genius status! A first time grandma
