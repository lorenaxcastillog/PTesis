 The "idea" is adorable and it looks amazing on the box, but the actualy product is very poor in quality. It takes forever to blow up, then we couldn't get the headboard part to stand up straight. It kept leaning in. The construction is very poor also. The sides are attached oddly and not made to last (hard to explain, but it is not one sold piece, each section is seperate). Ours also had a slow leak and would partially deflate by morning causing the castle (which was already leaning) to collapes. I called, e-mailed and wrote the company to get a replacement (I couldn't return it) and they would NEVER respond. You have to leave a voicemail message with the company and I couldn't get a live person. After 3 months I gave up and the junk is sitting in the closet. I wish Disney didn't allow their name to be put on this product
