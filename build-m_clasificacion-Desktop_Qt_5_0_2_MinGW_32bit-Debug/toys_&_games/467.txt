 Every time I see my twin daughters riding these bikes around I make a promise to write a review of the product. Here I am fulfilling my promise. They were able to pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them. They are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that I can carry both in the back of my small car (89 chevy camaro) and are light enough that I can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike. The only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns.
