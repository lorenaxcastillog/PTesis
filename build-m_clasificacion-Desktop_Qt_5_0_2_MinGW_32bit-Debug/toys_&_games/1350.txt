 Tamagotchis are awesome! When I was first introduced to Tamagotchi, I wasn't very interested in it until my friend borrowed one from a classmate. She played Jump-Rope over and over and over and over and - well, you get my point. She loved it! After watching her play it over and over and over, well, I got interested. "I wonder how she got glued to that little video game thing. I'd better find out." I thought. So when I was at Wal-Mart with my mom and brother, I selected 2 Tamagotchis from the toy section. After I played with it for a while, I thought, "These are really cool! On Monday I will tell my friend I have one." Before we got one, my mom said my brother could have too. "What?! No way! Those are for girls!" he said. But when he played... "Where's my Tamagotchi? Can I play with it PLEASE??? Dad, do you what's cool about Tamagotchi?" was all I heard from him. He never consentrated on his homework! I especially like the Infra-Red Communication
