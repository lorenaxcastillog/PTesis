 I ordered this (actually cheaper at Drugstore.com!) for my preteen and teen children to play. There wasn't much interest on Christmas morning between all the other gifts, but once the novelty wore off from all the high tech gifts a few days later, I challenged the kids to a game. It's a lot of fun and is different because you can't really sit around a table to play. Everybody is up on their feet looking at the tower from all angles to move their column. I was the loser 3 times in a row, and I didn't do it intentionally like a parent would for younger children! It was a lot of fun, and for parents with younger children it would be pretty educational to teach balance and physics principals. Guess I had better get a grasp on them myself
