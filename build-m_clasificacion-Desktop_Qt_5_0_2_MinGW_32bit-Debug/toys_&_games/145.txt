 I was very happy to discover that I could purchase an Asian Cabbage Patch Girl doll...it was for a little Korean girl....the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for (the hair). Well, I was excited to find one and I wanted to make sure that I would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for Christmas. I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st (I paid for faster shipping). When I opened the box it was an Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had short hair. I called Amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no problems but I am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch. I should have read the other reviews. I will never let that happen again. BEWARE...do not order things of this nature from this website. You will be disappointed
