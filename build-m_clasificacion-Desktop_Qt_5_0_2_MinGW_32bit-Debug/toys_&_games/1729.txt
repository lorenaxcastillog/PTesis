 This is a great toy for teaching little ones cause and effect. We got it for my son at 6 months and he's loved it since the very beginning. He figured out two of the buttons right away and was able to trigger them himself, unlike similar toys from other companies which are much harder to trigger. He was so excited to see the animals pop up and hear the music when he pushed the little lever or pulled the little ring. Now, at 16 months, he still plays with it sometimes, and know the animals and their sounds. Overall it's a great toy that will last your child a long time
