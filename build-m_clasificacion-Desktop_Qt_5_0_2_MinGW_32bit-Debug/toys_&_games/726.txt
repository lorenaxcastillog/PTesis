 My kids have 3 or 4 bins this size of Duplos. This particular set was recently given to one of my sons as a gift. It's an especially nice set because of the variety of colors included that you never see in the regular sets. The kids love looking at the pictures and making the animals with these blocks. They also use these blocks for their all-purpose building needs, as well. :) What a wonderful set! You just can't go wrong with Duplos! We have zillions and they are played with by all the kids (ages 2-8) regularly. I'd say our Duplos are the most played-with toy in this house
