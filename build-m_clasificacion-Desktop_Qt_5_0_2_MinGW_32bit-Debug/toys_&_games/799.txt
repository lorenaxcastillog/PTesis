 That would be for more playing spaces on the trayies of this game. The trayies only have 8 spaces. You may know hangman as a game you can do on the board like if you were playing Wheel of Fortune. The directions says the youngest player goes first. You pick a word, as long as you have space for the whole word. But to begin playing you have to the button on 11, and every time the person you are playing against gets a letter wrong, yuo move the button down one number, to reviel a line, then a another line until you you start seeing a person start to be hanged. If they get the letter(s) right, put the little letters in thier space that you see at the top of the tray. Play goes on into you or the person you are playing against get it right, in less you make your oppentent to contiune playing until either they get it right or they are hanged. This would be a great game to play, whether or not your a good artist
