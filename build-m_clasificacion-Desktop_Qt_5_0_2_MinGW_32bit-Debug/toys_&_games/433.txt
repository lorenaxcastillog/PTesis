 I just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls (3 and 5) with it today. It does blow tons of bubbles! They love chasing them all over the yard. The Gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out. It does used 8 AA batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor. Yes, it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries. Where I'll plug it in in the backyard I'm not sure yet. I definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles
