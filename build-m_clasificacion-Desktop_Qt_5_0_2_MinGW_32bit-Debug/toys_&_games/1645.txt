 I bought the toy for my 3yr old son for christmas and I have to say that he loved it. It is simple for a child to use with the accompany of an adult. I let him and my niece put the ice inside and we took turns turning the handle. The taste of the generic brand kool-aid was pretty nasty so I bought Kool-Aid packets on my own and made the juice myself. Overall I was pleased with it. I only paid 6.50 for it on an website it was worth it and a few more bucks. My son loves Spongebob; so he would have been pleased with a hat. lol but it is fun to make with little mess to no mess. I recommend it to anyone
