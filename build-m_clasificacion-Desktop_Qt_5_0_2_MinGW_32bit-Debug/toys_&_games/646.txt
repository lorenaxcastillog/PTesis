 Our son received this as a gift, and we sent it back. The box is made of inferior wood, and very poorly constructed. Not really "constructed" at all - rather just glued together, and not well, at that. Two of the corners were coming apart. Also, the lid opens in two parts. The drawback: when you open or close either side, the plastic trays on the inside that hold the crayons and pastels, fall out, as there is nothing securing them to the box. So, you have to try to hold the tray in place while closing either side. We can't comment on the supplies themselves, as we did not allow our son to try them, or else he would not have been able to return the item.
