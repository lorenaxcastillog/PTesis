 I was thinking of another sandbox - they had it out in the store and it looked pretty good. The day we were to bring it home I looked online to see how much sand we needed to buy and saw a long list of bad reviews and recommendations for the Naturally Playful Sandbox. We bought the Naturally Playful Sandbox and my 2½ year old daughter LOVES it. The lid is domed and holds all her toys inside. We had a heavy rain yesterday and everything inside stayed dry. We have only had it a week but know we made the right decision. A little bit more money was well worth it. Thanks to everyone who shared an opinion.
