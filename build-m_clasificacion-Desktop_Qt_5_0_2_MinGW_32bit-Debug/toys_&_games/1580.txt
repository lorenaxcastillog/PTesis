 My six-year-old helped me build this a few days ago and we had a lot of fun with it. It has some easy assemblies that are great for young kids who can't build the whole wheel themselves. Build time is around 3 - 4 hours and the result is well worth it. It's a lot of fun to sit and watch when the music is playing and the wheel is spinning. My only complaints are that the motor is too loud and the design doesn't allow for easy disengagement of the gears for manual spinning. And don't forget: there are instructions to build two other amusement park rides with this set for a total of three rides (but there are only enough pieces to build one at a time). Overall this is a must-have K'Nex set
