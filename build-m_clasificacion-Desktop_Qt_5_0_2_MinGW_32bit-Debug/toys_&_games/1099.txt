 I am shocked that two of the above reviews thought a dollar store replacement was ok for their BABY!!! The reason you pay more for a baby teether is so that it is PVC and Phthalate free. If you have a baby, please learn a minimum amount before sticking things in their mouths. In a nutshell, plastics leach harmful chemicals, and that's why you pay an extra couple of bucks to protect your baby. Also, if you look at the US Consumer Product Safety recalls every month, at least half the toys that are recalled are from the dollar store! I am constantly amazed at people. Anyway, this is a good toy
