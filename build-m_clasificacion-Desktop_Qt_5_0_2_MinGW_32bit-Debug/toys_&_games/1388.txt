 I got this game from my wife on X-mas. My family was excited to play it that evening. The game was excruciating to play. We are average SNL viewers having seen most episodes at some point in time (there are reruns on everyday), but the questions are TOO difficult. You would have to watch the show 12 hours a day and take detailed notes to get most of the questions right.The DVD only plays a few questions from each catagory so when you use up the questions it refers you back to the written questions. Lastly the DVD plays the same few SNL theme notes over and over again. We had to pause the game to make it stop. We returned the game the following day
