 I must admit I have a soft spot for the rubber duckie. My myspace page says it all. When I was a child all there was was the classic yellow rubber duckie that Ernie would occasionally break out in a song on Sesame Street. Now rubber duckies comes in all shapes and sizes. My personal favorite line of rubber duckies are the devil ducks. Not only do they come in yellow but blue, black, red, green, spotted, camo colours, zebra stripes, and my personal favorite...dressed up as a pirate. I can't really say if there is any educational value to the rubber duck but it sure beats those obnoxiously annoying toys the Elmo dolls and Furbys. Pirate Devil Duckie is the best because it represents the rebel that I am. Gotta love that eyepatch he wears.
