 Our 3 year old has had Wedgits and Magneatos and loves those. We debated about which Superstructs set to purchase and went with the largest one which was a wise move. Superstructs were a huge hit. They are holding up well despite rough, daily use. The only improvement I would like to see is in the consruction of the container. After three months it is starting to fall apart. I would have gladly spent a bit more to get a better storage container. Other than that, they are a great toy that fosters hours of imaginative play for the entire family. We will be adding to the set soon
