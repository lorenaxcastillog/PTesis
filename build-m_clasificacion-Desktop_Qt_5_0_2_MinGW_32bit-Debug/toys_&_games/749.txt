 We bought this croc for our son (5) who loves anything Hot Wheels and found that most of the cars don't work with this. Also, the sounds are annoying to the point of my son wanting it to stop.. which is very rare. Half of the time the crocs mouth won't drop shut, and I agree with one of the other reviews saying that it's nearly impossible to get the car in the boat. We tried and tried and got it in there once. Most of the time the car never even made it to the boat because it flipped over after dropping from the crocs mouth. Amazon is correct in charging only $5 for this toy, it's not worth any more than that.
