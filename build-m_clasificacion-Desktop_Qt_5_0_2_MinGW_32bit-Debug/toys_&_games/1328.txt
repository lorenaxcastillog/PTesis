 I had no idea how this gun worked before I got it, but figured since it could fire 20 darts it would be decent. It's a pretty good gun, it uses two spinning plastic discs to hurl the darts forward. The problem with this, is that it isn't always accurate, depending on how the dart gets ejected into them, and also it's kind of loud when it's on. But you can fire 20 darts within a few seconds, that still makes it very fun. I've already lost 2 darts though, and only emptied the clip a few times. Now I need to find the refills someplace
