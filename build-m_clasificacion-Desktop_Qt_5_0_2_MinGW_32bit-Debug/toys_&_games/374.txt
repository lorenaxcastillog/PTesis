 We are loving this set! Very cool dragons, a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in. Extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron, tramcar on sloped tracks, erupting mountain top, opening dragon mouth, flapping dragon wings, firing cannon. A little challenging to build, but the instructions are fairly clear. Assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours. A few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together. So far no pieces have broken. Most important, this is a lot of fun to play with. Over the past two days, our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl. A great toy for two kids to play with together, and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself. We wouldn't have paid the full retail price for this, but at $35 (Amazon discounted price), I think this is appropriate value.
