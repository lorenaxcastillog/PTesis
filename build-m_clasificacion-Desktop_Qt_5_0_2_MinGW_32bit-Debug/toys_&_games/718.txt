 My son got this for his first birthday and has loved it for the past 4 months. He learned very quickly how to place the balls along the top and hit them with the hammer. He squeals while he watches the balls roll through the mirrored maze inside... it's very cute. The only problem I have with it is that he's figured out how to stuff all sorts of small toys into the holes on top, including his fisher price little people animals. They can get into the toy, but I have to take a screwdriver to open the back and get them out. I do wish it unsnapped easier to free trapped toys, but the upside is that it's very durable and hard for a toddler to destroy
