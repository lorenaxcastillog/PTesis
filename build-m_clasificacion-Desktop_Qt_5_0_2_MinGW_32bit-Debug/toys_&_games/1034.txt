 I got this after getting the Star Station for my son, but only being able to use the cartriges there. My son LOVES this and listens to this in the car all the time. I love it because he gets to listen to his music and I don't. :) He even enjoys it soo much that he took it to his first Sharing Day at Kindergarten. He says he listens to it so that he can practice to be on American Idol. Whatever his reason, I love it because it allows him to listen to music and is VERY durable!!
