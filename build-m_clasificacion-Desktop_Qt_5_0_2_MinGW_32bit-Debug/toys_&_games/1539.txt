 My daughter has autism and has had absolutly no interest in dolls. She didn't quite know what she was suppose to do with them or how to do imaginative play with them. We recently purchased this doll for her and she hasn't set her down yet. She pretend cries for the doll and tickles her. She feeds her and won't sleep without her. I think this doll has woken up emotions in my daughter that were not there before. This has taught her to understand empathy and how to care for someone. Autistic children like weighted objects and the beanie bottom of the doll makes her different from the other dolls we have given our daughter. I think the heavyness of the doll makes my daughter want to hold her constantly. Im so greatful that we got this doll and it has had such a wonderful impact on my daughter
