 Like many of the other reviews (that I read after receiving the doll), I got a hispanic doll with red hair... whoever heard of that! My daughter is adopted from Guatemala and has black, straight hair.... This doll depicted how I style her hair and would have been a perfect match, as it also had black hair.... after waiting for a week, I received the doll, expecting it to look like the one pictured, and it wasn't.... I am highly, highly disappointed, and have emailed all of my contacts telling them about this and giving them the sight to view all the unhappy comments on this as well as pass along to their contacts..... I will never make this mistake again.... as the saying goes.... "Fool me once, shame on YOU...fool me twice, shame on ME.... well, shame on them!!!
