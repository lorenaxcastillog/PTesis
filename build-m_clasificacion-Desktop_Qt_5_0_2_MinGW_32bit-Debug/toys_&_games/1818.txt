 My son's first reaction to his new 'big boy' furniture was to open the drawers and climb up. We tried the lesser expensive spring locks, but he can still open the drawers a little bit and climb up. That's when I found the tot locks and the drawers do not budge unless you have the key. I love the option where he can't pry the drawer open to climb. Spring locks are good in our kitchen for easy frequent access, but for a bedroom tot locks are perfect! I've read reviews where they are difficult to install, I had no issues at all with directions or install
