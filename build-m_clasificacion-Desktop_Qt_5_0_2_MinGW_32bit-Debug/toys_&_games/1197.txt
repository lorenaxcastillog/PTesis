 I received these as a gift for my son when he was still really small. I really liked the sturdiness of the plastic...no denting no matter how enthusiastically he chewed them! The colors were great, bright and well-combined for eye-grabbing contrast on the individual beads. My son found a lot to do with these...snap them together, line them up, take them out of the container and put them back in again, use them in pretend play. They were a great gift and I think just about any parent...and their child...would be happy to add these to their stock of playthings
