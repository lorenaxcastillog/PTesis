 Horrible advertising on these packages. It shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it only makes two "bowls" of pasta. The servings are so tiny, that if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta. Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook! Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray. The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add. We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses. Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat. They need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying "4pack" Eight thumbs down from this family
