 The concept behind this toy is great, but the engineering/design is not. Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured. Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours. We've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth. The music is HORRIBLY loud. We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room. Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch. This one desperately needs one!! On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute. He will chase the balls when they go flying. He's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out, but he'll get there. He'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music
