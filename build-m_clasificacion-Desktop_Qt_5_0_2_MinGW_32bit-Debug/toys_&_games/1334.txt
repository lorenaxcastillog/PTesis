 I bought this game for my 4 year old daughter to play with her 7 year old sister(who has Down Syndrome.) Both girls LOVE it! They quickly convinced their 16 year old brother to play. This is one of the few games where a 4 year old and a 16 year old are on the same footing. Skillfully loading your meatball onto the fork is a matter of technique that is easily mastered by the younger set. This has brought us hours of laughter and fun so far and will become, I am sure, a family classic. Harmless meatballs will fly over your head, giggles will follow. You might find yourself purposely "missing" every now and then just to watch them fly. I would recommend this game for any setting that incorporates adults and children in cooperative play. Also, my two youngest can easily set up and manage the game by themselves.
