 This is the best gift I purchased for my son for Christmas this year. He has played with it so often we have had to replace the batteries 3 times already. He has just about all the monsters. The only problem we had in the beginning is showing him how to get it to work. Since he has learned how to start it he has had no problems. Love it!!! UPDATE - You can no longer purcahse the fushion dome characters and most of ours have lost arms and do not read when placed on dome. I do feel I got my moneys worth because my son is very rough on his toys. I just wish they would make more
