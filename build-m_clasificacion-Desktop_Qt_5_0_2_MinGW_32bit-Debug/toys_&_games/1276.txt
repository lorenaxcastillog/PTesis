 My 8 year old was DYING to have this doll, bought it and she looks like a ASHY ethnic doll (not cute like the picture online). Amanda gets kinda confused with some things and she doesn't hear too well unless you yell at her, The whole potty thing is funny(she makes a pooping sound and the turd falls)now that is funny. The facial expressions are .. well.. different. My daughter LIKES her, we dont play with her everyday, she's kinda annoying after a while, oh! she wakes us up about 1 hour late! Pretty scary to wake up to that voice every morning. I think she should be on clearance now....about $19.99. So somebody owes me some MONEY!!!
