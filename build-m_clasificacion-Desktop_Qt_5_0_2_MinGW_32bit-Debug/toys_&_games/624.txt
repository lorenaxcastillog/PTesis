 This kitchen is fabulous!! I bought this for my daughters. We used this kitchen as a replacement for the SSC kitchen we had. I ordered this direct from Step2. It was 199.99 and free shipping. It was delivered very fast since their factory is very close to me. I have 7, 4 and 2 yr old girls. This was a HUGE hit with my 2 yr old. My 7 yr old is more into her gameboy and my 4 yr old loves the kitchen as well. This was very easy to assemble. The lables were very easy to apply. The acc. that come with this are very high quality. I am thinking of ordering more acc. from Step2. Dont waist your time looking at other kitchens. Spend the extra money and order this one. Step2 has the smaller lifestyle kithcen. It is just a step down from this one, but looks much smaller. I saw it at TRU. Once I saw that one I had made my decision to order the Deluxe kitchen. The other one didn't have the free ship anyway. Overall this kitchen is very high quality and the best on the market in my opinion.
