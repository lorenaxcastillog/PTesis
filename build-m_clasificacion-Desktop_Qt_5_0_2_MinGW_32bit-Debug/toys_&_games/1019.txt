 My 5yo daughter received the Polly Pocket sticker maker as a Hanukkah gift from a beloved friend of the family, thus I feel terrible writing such a bad review on this product because the gesture was so kind. Generous gift aside though, the product SUCKS!!! Seriously, no matter what anyone might tell you otherwise, DO NOT buy this product. First, it is nearly impossible to put together and the directions are not comprehensible. I was shocked that I actually got it together (it took me about 30 minutes although there are very few parts), but sure enough, as soon as I did, my daughter made one or two stickers and the whole thing just jammed up and broke completely. Believe me - there was NO WAY to fix it. I threw the whole thing in the garbage. She was really sad about it, but believe me, I had no other choice. Had it not been a gift (I had no gift receipt) I would have returned it for a full refund. Please do not make the same mistake as my very well-intentioned friend who bought this product for my child. Avoid it. It is NOT worth your money
