 I purchased this table and chairs for my 3 year old twins. Just the other day for some reason one of the chairs were upside down I noticed a little plastic plug that unscrews and comes out. Well, I found out that the chairs can be filled with a little sand so that way they can not tip over anymore. My twins were both falling off the chairs everytime they would go to get on them, but now with the sand holding the chair down they are a little more stable. I hope this helps everyone that has this set. I am pretty happy with this table now
