 My biggest complaint with this doll is that her hair seems to be a little thin. This does not seem to bother my daughter who got her for her birthday yesterday, she loves her. She does speak english but it took my older daughter (12) to figure out exactly how long to hold the button in on the bracelet. I think the doll should come with more than two diapers, especially considering she comes with 3 packs of food. Overall, I'm satisfied because my kid is happy with her but would recommend anyone buying the doll to have plenty of diapers on hand
