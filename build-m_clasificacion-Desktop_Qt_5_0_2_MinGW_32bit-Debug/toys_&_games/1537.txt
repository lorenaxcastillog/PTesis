 I gave this to my son for his 6th Birthday - He had been asking for it since last summer. It keeps him so busy and quiet - the instructions were great - he didn't need any help. He keeps taking it apart and modifying the design to make it smaller, and smaller, and smaller. Then he builds it back to the origianl size. He has had it for 3 weeks and still thanks me for getting it for him. Beacause of the size, he doesn't rush through it and toss it aside like his many other smaller lego sets. Highly recommend it - wish I got it sooner
