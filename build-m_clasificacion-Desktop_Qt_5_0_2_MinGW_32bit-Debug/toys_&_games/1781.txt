 Uno is an excellent game for any age 7 and up (according to the makers; I've watched a sharp 4 yr old enjoy playing with only slightly modified rules). It is easy to learn but continues to provide challenging play for years. The rules are easily modified to accomodate diffenent skill levels or time available. This one doesn't need bells and whistles, it is great as it is. Although Mattel would not encourage this (or even suggest it) playing for points lends itself to modest wagers, and to an extent, allows for handicaping with players of different skill levels. The educational value is not obvious, but is significant. It teaches players to think ahead, consider branches and sequels of actions, and strategy. The compact size (like two standard poker decks) allows this one to travel well, and can be played on trains, planes, boats, buses, and in tents.
