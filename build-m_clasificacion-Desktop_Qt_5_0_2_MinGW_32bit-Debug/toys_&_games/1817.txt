 I was so excite to get these locks, and that soon wore off. We have a newer home and all of our cabinets have trim or molding around the outside. Both my husband And I tried to install and get them to work. We had no such luck are cabinets were to thick but were not thick enough to use the extender. After mean attempts and many failures we returned them. Our friends also had the same problem. Be careful we almost drilled a whole through the cabinet door. I have another friend who has these in her house and they do work great for her, her cabinets are flat. Just be weary and save your receipt.
