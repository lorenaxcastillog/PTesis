 I recently played this game on a very wet day when play had been suspendedat the ITF veteran team conpetition in South Africa. One of the American team produced right left centre and 18 ladies from 6 different countries spent a memorable time playing it. Our hosts, the South African ladies, from the Chiltern Club in Durban looked on in amazement. On return home to Ireland I wanted to purchase it to take with me on my travels, to introduce it to my school class and to use it at family get-to-gethers. I am really disappointed to find I cannot get it shipped to Ireland. It is brilliant fun both as an ice breaker ( many different languages played and this was no inhibitor) and to pass a wet day. It is the first game I have played that, until the final chip is left on the table, everyone is still in the game. Can you help me to purchase it? Letty Luca
