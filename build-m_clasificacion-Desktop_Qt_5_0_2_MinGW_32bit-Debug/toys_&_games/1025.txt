 My 7 and 6 year old LOVE their new game, mind wars junior. It is like trivial pursuit in different subject areas, like language, math, physical science, life science and social studies...to give you an idea, it has questions dealing with various subjects, like Christopher Columbus, gases, elements, Antartica, Martin Luther King Jr. and lots more.... My kids didn't want to stop playing it is very easy to hook up, all you do is plug it in your system set the board on the leap pad, turn it on and play... It is very EASY to understand and they even have a repeat button, and volume control on the game, all the kids have to do, is go around as many spaces as the game tells them after they push the button, then they answer various questions, and first one to close all 5 subject windows wins! There is multiple choice, and also true and false questions...lots of fun! :) Very happy with this item! Keep up the awesome work leap frog! I loved watching them play... I give this a DEFINATE 5 star rating! Next, I will have to get the one for older kids....3rd grade up...
