 I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. I had already read the other reviews so I already had the drill ready for assembly. It really wasn't that bad and only took about 30 minutes for us to put together. The parts aren't numbered but it was really easy to tell what went where because the shapes are pretty unique for each step. My son started climbing up it before we could even get the first part together and played on it for as long as we would let him afterwards. I would probably get something bigger for say a 5 year old but for toddlers this is perfect. One side is open but really, who lets their toddler play outside alone
