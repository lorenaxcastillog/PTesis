 This is a truly great game and underscores the adage &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot;! All ages can play...even my 2 year old can pull out a stick and see if made a marble fall. I have only one complaint...the quality of the physical aspect of the game. Of course I had Kerplunk as a kid and the tube and tray &amp; sticks were much heavier plastic. With this Kerplunk you must hold the tube to pull a stick out or the whole shebang will fall over. Maybe an original classic version will be produced. I have noticed this same skimping on other great games such as &quot;trouble&quot; and &quot;don't break the ice&quot; etc...I would pay a few more dollars for better quality but suggest you buy it &quot;as is&quot; anyway
