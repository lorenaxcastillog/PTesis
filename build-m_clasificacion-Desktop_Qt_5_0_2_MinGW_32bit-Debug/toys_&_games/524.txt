 We got this for our son about a month ago. He's almost 14 months now, younger than the recommended age of 3 years, but he is never unsupervised when using the playhut. Our son loves to play hide and seek (hiding from us, of course :))inside the playhut, or just going in and retrieving the balls we toss in there for him. He doesn't exactly know what to do with the basketball hoop yet, but I'm sure that will come. He has lost his balance while in the playhut and knocked it down, but it pops right back up. And, since we have it up against a wall, it is more stable anyway. Enjoy
