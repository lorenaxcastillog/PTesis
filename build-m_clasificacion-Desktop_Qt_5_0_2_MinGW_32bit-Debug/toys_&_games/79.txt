 I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning. First, the battery box is very poorly designed. Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again. The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open. Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out! My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad. The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog
