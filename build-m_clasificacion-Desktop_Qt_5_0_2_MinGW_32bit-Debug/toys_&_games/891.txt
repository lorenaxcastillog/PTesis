 The one they are advertising is not the one you will receive. The one shown has nine sounds and no fluffy the cat. The one you will receive has three sounds and includes fluffy the cat. There are two models, so it is confusing. I've ordered this twice already and each time I didn't receive the one being advertised. I don't know why they don't advertise it for what it is. The model you get sells for about $30.00. Amazon is selling that model too. Ihave no idea why they don't correct this. I've already fallen for it twice. You would think I would have learned the first time
