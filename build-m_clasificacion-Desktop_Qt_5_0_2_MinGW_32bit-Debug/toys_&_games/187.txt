 This is pretty much kid vs kid only. Adults cannot play along. You can make it into a solo game for one child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that. The product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words. The rules propose two games, which are basically see if the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they do, first kid with 5 cards wins. Adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will "fall for it." It really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing. I don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over. Therefore, to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is. Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning tool. Your call.
