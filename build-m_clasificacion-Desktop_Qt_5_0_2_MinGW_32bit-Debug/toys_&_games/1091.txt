 We bought this last spring(05) for our daughters 1st birthday. We also have a now almost 2yr old and 4yr old, who both love this item. Every day we come home and they want to get right in it. Since is has a table, I can be doing my own thing and they can eat lunch a snack or whatever. Just watch where the sand goes. The only draw back is that it will hold water even if the plug is open and lid on. So you just have to keep and eye out, and you may also want to put a brick on the lid during heavy rains and winds
