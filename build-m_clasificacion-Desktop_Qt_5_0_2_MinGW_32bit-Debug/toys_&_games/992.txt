 I actually found this toy at a used children's store and bought it for him at about 7 months. Since then, it's become his favorite toy - played with many times every day. We were a bit concerned about the pull, as he likes to put everything in his mouth, so we cut that off. But he'll still grab it and pull it towards him, tip it over. When I push it toward him, he laughs and giggles at the face. And the rounds, he LOVES. He plays with those all day long - pushing them away, tossing them, chasing after them. It's a great toy for him, and I get a lot of enjoyment watching him with it
