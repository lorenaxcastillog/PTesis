 I bought this toy for my son and I figured if it turns out too 'girly' I would give it to my niece. As it turned out, it is definitely not adequae for my son but it is definitely more adequate for my son than my niece! It has also gender neutral issues. Let me give a couple of examples and if I have time one day I will give more specifics: This toy has sophisticated electronics but the design behind it seems lacking. For example, it will give negative feedback for choosing the wrong answer but I will not give any feedback if you chose the right answer:-) The toy is designed to encourage vanity and other undesirable traits and feels like it was designed by someone who has a sterotypical and negative view of what American girls are like. More later got to go.. Probably designed by some insensitive backward male out there.. And my apologies to all the good guys out there. I know there are a lot of you out there and I am married to one of them:-)
