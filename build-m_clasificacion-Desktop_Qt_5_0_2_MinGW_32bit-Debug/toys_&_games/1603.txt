 The batmobile is beautiful. Lots of pieces in the set, not too many of the lame 'special' pieces (not nearly as bad as the harry potter kits). I particularly liked how they did the wheel logos - they printed a bat symbol on an old satellite dish from the old spaceship sets. And there's plenty of other stuff you can build with this kit, as long as it's black. But, the black pieces are the big drawback - the instruction manual doesn't print the bumps on black bricks well at all. It is very hard to tell exactly what piece is in the manual, making it much harder to build the pictured car. Still, any kid or collector should be very pleased with this set
