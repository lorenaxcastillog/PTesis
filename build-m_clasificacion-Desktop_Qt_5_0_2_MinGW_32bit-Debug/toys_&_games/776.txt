 With twin 4 year old girls, I have vast experience with little houses, castles, etc... This toy far exceeds most of them out there, including many disney products and barbie castles. The pieces are small, yet manageable and sturdy. There are enough "tricks" (working light, mailbox, etc..) to keep it interesting, yet not so many that it is too much for a preschooler. The miniature little ponies are adorable and fun to play with. I was impressed with the product considering the affordable price ($22 and it came with an extra free pony). I have paid $20 already for a barbie castle that only comes with tiny thin miniature plastic pieces (that always get lost) and thin, cheap plastic structures that do nothing (no lights, etc..) This product is well worth it
