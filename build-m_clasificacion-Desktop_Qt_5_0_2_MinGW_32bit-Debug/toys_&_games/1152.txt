 Although this toy is a bit expensive, it is well worth the money. It is extremely well-made and durable, especially important for boys. My son is 18 months old and very much into "cause and effect". He loves remote controls of any kind and is constantly trying to figure out how his actions, i.e., button-pressing, with any kind of electronic device cause a subsequent reaction. This toy is great because it taps right into his curiosity for that. Not only is it a shape sorter with the recognizable characters from "Ready, Set, Learn!", but the remote has two modes - forward and reverse/turn. The headlights even come on in forward mode. All in all, I highly recommend this toy from about 18 months up. Even my 4-year-old daughter loves it
