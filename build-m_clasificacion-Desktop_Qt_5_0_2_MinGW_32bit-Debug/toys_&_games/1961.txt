 My son got these for a gift. He had seen them on tv and expressed interest. He is 8. I saw the commerical and then saw what was in the box and was confused. Basically there was a pair of velcro sandles and then some large rubber bands (about 24) to attach them to a large black oval piece of plastic. After putting them together which took about 20 minutes, it took my son another 2 days to learn to balance on them. he still can't jump and I'm afraid if he tried to jump like the person on the commerical he would twist his ankle. I feel really bad for the relative that spent $40 on these. I wouldn't recommend them.
