 I must admit I am biased toward Lights, Camera, Interaction toys. My daughter has several of this line's toys and for the greater part we have been very pleased with the durability and educational factor of their products. The same goes for this alphabet puzzle. Even though the raised letters do not have pegs they are easily removed from the board. I like that the examples for the letters are not your general toddler "cat" and "balloon" icons, which broaden their understanding of the letters. I sing the "ABC" song to my daughter while I point to the letters and then practice pronouncing the words to the pictures and alphabet. A great hands-on way for little ones to learn the alphabet besides from the TV
