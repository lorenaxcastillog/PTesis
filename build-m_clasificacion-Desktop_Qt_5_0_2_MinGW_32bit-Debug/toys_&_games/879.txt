 Cloe is a very cute doll, not as cute as the others, but cute. I got her on my birthday from my aunt. She has long golden blond hair about to her knees, with big blue eyes that SCREAM cute. The outfit she comes in is an off-white tank top with a short denim jacket with "buttons" on it. Her skirt is a velvety, stretchy light pink material with a white "studded" belt over it. Her shoes are white with gold little heart and a pink "stone" in the middles. Her second outfit is a long tunic top with swirls of cream, brown, pink, and green. She has blue jeans with little rips in the knees, and pink flats with silver decorations. Thanks for reading
