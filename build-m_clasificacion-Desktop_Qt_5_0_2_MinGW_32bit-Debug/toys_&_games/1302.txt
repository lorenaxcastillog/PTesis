 We bought this toy for our nine year son. I have to say, we expected a whole lot more. While the frog's internal organs are interesting, and reasonably true to life, there is no schmatic diagram of any kind. So, once the child has "dissected" the frog and removed the organs, it is a matter of guesswork as to how they go back in. More like just fitting them in best you can rather than really understanding how the various pices/organs fit back into the frog. It would be far more useful if there were a schematic diagram which the child could follow to reassemble the internal organs. As such this turned out to be a "play with it once" and then put it on the shelf item. Too bad as it is a great idea. Just needs a bit more in terms of directives
