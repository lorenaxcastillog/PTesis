 Pretty expensive but I ended up splurging and getting it for my 8 year old nephew for this coming Christmas. I ended up giving it to him this weekend instead; I wanted to see it go too and couldn't wait 4 months! My nephew REALLY likes it but, oy!, is the video bad -- what they show in the online commercial is quite a bit clearer and contrasty than what we see in our actual unit. I think the infrared aspect blurs things a bit and its sensitivity is pretty low in any case. You can't read ANY writing thru the video, regardless of size of print, etc. Still, the video link is minimally serviceable (adequate for manuevering with a little bit of practice) and my nephew has a BIG time sitting in his "command center" and sending it out on "remote missions" using only the onboard video link. Seems fairly robust and sturdy so far
