 When we bought this, I liked the versatility it offered. I quickly noticed, however, that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere. There are actually too many pieces to keep up with, and frankly I'm getting sick of stepping on the cow. My 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes, until he's rolled away from it. My 3 year old thinks it's interesting, but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place. After a couple days of playing with it I usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys. The water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice. Then that was gone
