 This tent is adorable! Its great for anywhere not just the beach! Its great when your at the park or picnic and need to have a little privacy to change baby without having to tote them back to the car, or when you want to put baby down for a nap but keep them close at the same time. Has velcro closure door instead of a zipper so you do have to keep an eye out if your baby is big enough to push on the door. Very light, easy assembly and comes with a storage bag. All in all, very handy item for under $20
