 3 of my friends' sons have had this tractor. All 3 have complained of the tires popping right off, exposing the wire that connects the 2 together. I figured maybe it was because they bought them from another retailer or something, maybe rough housing? Though our sons are 2, they're truly not rough with these much cherished Cars toys! :) Anyway, bought mine from the Disney store for [...] 2 days later, after watching my son simply watch the movie w/the tractor, play randomly w/it- nothing crazy- the tire popped right off. Thank God I noticed before my other son, who is 15 months old! Good luck with this one- I'm on my way to write the company on this disastrous & dangerous product- don't purchase is my advice, unless you want a sort of rental toy (it WILL break within days
