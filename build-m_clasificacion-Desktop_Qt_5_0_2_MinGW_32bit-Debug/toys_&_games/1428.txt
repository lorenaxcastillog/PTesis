 These babies are so cute! I was suprised when I found a bunch of them yesterday at a local store for the same price as the other individual characters, and now I wish I'd grabbed two sets, since they are such a huge hit! One of my kids was a little annoyed that the babies stay sitting - their legs don't move, but once convinced that babies don't really walk at all, she has forgotten all about that fact. The twins sit perfectly, and don't topple over, plus they seem to be just the perfect size. Definantly a great addition to the Dora DollHouse character collection
