 I quite like the Sakar MP3 case. It offers good protection for my IRiver IHP-120, and the sound quality is fairly good. I've read some reviews where the reviewer complained that one has to completely open the case to operate their IPod. My IRiver has an external corded remote, so this is not a problem for me. The choice of 9V battery was a poor one, however. 9V batteries do not offer good battery life, especially for heavy use. I use this at work, so it's on for 8 hours a day. a 9V battery will only last for 3 maybe 4 days, whereas a similar MP3 speaker case that uses 3 AA will last for weeks. I would give this 5 stars if Sakar had chosen to use AA batteries.
