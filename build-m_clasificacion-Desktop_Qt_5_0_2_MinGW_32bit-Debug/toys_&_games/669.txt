 I would have rated this lower, but the idea is so great. My 7yo loves his book. Be careful w/ the pages you submit. We ordered two books and the first book contains the original submitted pages w/ artwork (except the cover which was scanned and reprinted on "glossy" paper). The 2nd book was, of course, all photocopied pages of the first. They simply take your submitted artwork pages and someone (or possibly an OCR), prints your submitted text just under your drawings; then binds the pages into the book, with the title page , dedication page, etc. Not as sturdy a book as I thought it should be, but as I said, my kid loves it, so that's what matters most. &lt;grin
