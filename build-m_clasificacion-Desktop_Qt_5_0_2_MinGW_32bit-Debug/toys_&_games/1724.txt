 The castle is cheaply made and comes with so few accesories worthy of mention and without the types of accessories that would make it something fun to play with. My daughter has hardly even played with hers, with the exception of opening and closing the castle just to hear the sound! She also noticed on her own that the apecial "wand" used to open the castle was not like the one in the adverstisement...."Mommy, there's no crystal on my wand, look!" Also, the dance floor so weak it's nearly impossible for my 5 year old to even manuever. A definite disappointment for the $
