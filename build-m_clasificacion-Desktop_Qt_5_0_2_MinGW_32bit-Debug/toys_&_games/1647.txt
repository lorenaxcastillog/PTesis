 As other reviewers have mentioned, the game is easy to set-up and put away. I took off one star mainly because the penguins occasionally fall into the crack between the wobbling iceberg and the stable platform and are difficult to remove. In addition, my son gets frustrated with the game very quickly, since a falling penguin can potentially take the other penguins down with him. I'm trying to teach him to relax, but six-year-olds cannot always be persuaded that life will go whether the penguins remain upright or not. We've learned to play a few quick rounds and then try a different activity entirely
