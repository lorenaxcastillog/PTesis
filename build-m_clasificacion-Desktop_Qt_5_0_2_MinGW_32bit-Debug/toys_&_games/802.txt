 I like the handle to carry this keyboard around, but it is kind of awkward for little ones to use unless it is sitting on a table or other flat object. The characters will set off when they are moved and you get a jumbled mass of sound coming out of it if it is resting against something that causes the characters to be pushed in all at once. I know my 2 year old does not like to be sitting still, so using this on a table is not really an option for her. And because of the height of the characters, it is not a good "bring along" toy since it doesn't fit in a bag well. For the same price, go with the Wiggles Guitar. It has many more buttons and songs and they can carry it around and play it at the same time
