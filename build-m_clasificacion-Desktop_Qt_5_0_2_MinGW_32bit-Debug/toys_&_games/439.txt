 We just got this for my daughter's 5th Birthday. This toy was what received the greatest excitement. While opening presents, my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs, "I got a Brietta Pegasus!" The pegasus itself is durable, beautiful, and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play. I didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box. Many toys are packaged that way these days... Perhaps an anti-theft plan. I just got some scissors and Brietta was out to play. So far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. If they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. A small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours. As a mom who also loved unicorns and Pegasus ponies as a girl, I'm glad I can give that magic to my own girls
