 My 5 yr. old son just LOVES this! He loves playing LEGO Star Wars on the Gamecube and loves to pretend with these. We are always rescuing the princess and fighting Darth Vader. We even consult Yoda for instructions. These have a button you slide so you can wave the base and the "light" saber flies out...lots of fun! Then it retracts with a little pushing/tapping and snaps into the base so you can wear it around using the clip (slides into a pocket or over the waistband of pants). The handles look really cool, too. This is a great deal at $5.29 and free shipping since the little figures are $6 for a 2-pk. at Target
