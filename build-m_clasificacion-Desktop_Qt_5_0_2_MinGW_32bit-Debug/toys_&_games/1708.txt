 Once again Fisher Price has made a fun and durable toy. My 4 year old son got this crane for Christmas and just loves to use it with the RC geotrax trains and other track systems. He also has the elevation tracks and the airport and it's so much fun to unload cargo from the plane and then to the crane. My son plays with it for hours! And it's so durable, the crane has taken quite a bit of abuse from both my 4 year old and my 2 year old son and it still works like new. We have 2 RC trains and both my kids can operate them on their own and are so proud to make the trains move themselves. We will keep adding to our Geotrax and have fun with it for years. The Geotrax system is a must have for any train lover or any kid who loves to use their imagination.
