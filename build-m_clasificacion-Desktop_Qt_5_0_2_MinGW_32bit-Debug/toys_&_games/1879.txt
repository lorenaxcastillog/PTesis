 I don't actuelly have this set,but I want to point out some of the options and possiblities that this set has. 1.You could take of the leaves (there are only 3 of them)and have a realy good if not exellent replica of a clean X-wing. 2.with the leaves of and TIE fighters,bombers or Darth Vaders TIE fighter you could recreate scenes from the battels in both Star Wars 4 and 6. I also want to say how much an improvment this set is over the original. First: the color it's much better. Secound: the "nose" is swept in.That was really missing from the original. Third:It's more proportional than the original
