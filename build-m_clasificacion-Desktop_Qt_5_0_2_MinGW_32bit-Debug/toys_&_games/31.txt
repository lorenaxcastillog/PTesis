 I wish I'd read the reviews before buying this product! I would have saved us money and aggravation. I bought these for my son's Christmas present this year. He was really excited about playing with them with his sister. The problem is, we haven't been able to find one single spot -- inside or out -- where we can get reception on both units! Even when you can pick up one person on the handset, the sound is so staticky and crackly, that you can barely make out what the person is saying. What's the point? My kids got so frustrated in the first couple of days, that they dumped them in the toybox and haven't played with them since. What an incredible waste of money and such a let down for the kids on Christmas. It's pretty rotten that National Geographic can conscience putting this piece of junk on the market. Don't make my mistake. Heed these reviews! This is a must-avoid product
