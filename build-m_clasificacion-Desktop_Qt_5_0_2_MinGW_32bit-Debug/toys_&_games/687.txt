 I have a very tall 4 year old and an almost 2 year old. They were constantly fighting over foot room in the big Step 2 wagon. I broke down and bought this $[...] Radio Flyer Navigator wagon. After using it for a couple of months now, it was well worth the money. It is considerably bigger (wider seats, slightly more room for feet) plus a storage seat to boot. It is a much nicer ride (nicer wheels, longer handle, feels less likely to tip over even with sharp turns). I use this wagon to cart my kids everywhere, fromt the mall to the museums. Since this wagon holds up to 150lbs, I figure I'll get another couple of years out of it. Very much worth the money.
