 I ordered this car one week before Christmas and it was shipped to the wrong address. When Christmas came and went I checked my account with Amazon found where the address was off by one number and emailed Amazon with the error with no response so I emailed them again still with no response. Yesterday a month after the original order I received an email from Amazon stating that they were not able to deliver the car so they were refunding the money back to my credit card. I unfortunately have a very disappointed little girl and I am without a car. If they had checked my emails to them they could have delivered the car to my correct address. The service with Amazon is horrible but I bet the car is great
