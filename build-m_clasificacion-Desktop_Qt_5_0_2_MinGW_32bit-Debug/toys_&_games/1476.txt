 We just received this golf set in the mail, and were so excited. My almost-three daughter and I wanted it to play inside on rainy spring days. Both handles came out of both foam clubheads the second time we used the set. We only used the clubs and set for playing golf inside, and the set was used a total of about 20 minutes. This set is rated for ages 3-7. I don't see how it could hold up to a seven year old when my almost-three daughter broke it on its second use. We are sending this set back today, and ordered the Little Tikes set this morning
