 I love this new edition of Clue Jr. It actually looks like Clue now. My 5 year old is a little slow with the strategy, but she might do better playing against kids her own age instead of her older sister and her parents. :) Easy to set up, no shuffling of cards, you put each of the characters on a "stand" that has a different time on the bottom of it and put different things in the room (like a plant or a pool table) on a stand that has a beverage on the bottom of it. The extra time and beverage stands go in the middle and you try to figure out what they are. No one has a character so you can move anyone around the rooms making it more equal for everyone. And you don't hold any cards in your hands so its easier for the kids to keep track of. Still comes with clue sheets that have places to mark off what you find out.
