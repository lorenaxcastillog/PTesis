 My kids 2 & 4 like this leap book. We are not especially JayJay fans, but I was really pleased with the content of this book. It has some really neat stuff to learn about in it...not just the ABC's and 123's. Its content includes many science themes like Animals,Dinosaurs, Planets and Solar system, Landforms, Seasons and weather, as well as simply learning what goes on in the Day and Nightime or what to wear for different weather. The main story focuses on a butterfly named Breezy that is flying south. I was pleased with the different content that it provided, it was a nice change from the typical abc's. You don't have to be a JayJay fan to enjoy this one, but Science is the main theme here so if you are looking for abc's and 123's...you wont find that. I gave it 4 stars for durability simply because its paper, and it can get worn
