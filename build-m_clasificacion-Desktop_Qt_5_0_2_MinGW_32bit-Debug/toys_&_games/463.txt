 I bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born. He absolutely loves this doll! I babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while I cared for the baby I keep. He had regressed and started wetting his pants again when I began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for! The yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it IS only a doll! If the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my son, great for younger kids. My husband did not want our son having a "girl" doll and I can't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her.
