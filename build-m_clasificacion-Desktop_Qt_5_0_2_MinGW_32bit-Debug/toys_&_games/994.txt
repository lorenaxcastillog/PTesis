 Rummy is a very fun game. My husband and I play it several nights a week (and we are both 26 years old, so it is not like we don't have other things to do). It is a great bonding time for the family, and kids love it too! This particular set of Rummykub is a high quality product: it will not deteriorate with time (unless you repeatedly drive it over with a car, i suppose). I am very satisfied! My husband and I canceled cable because we have our entertainment source now... a game of Rummy! As a suggestion: for extra challenge and diversity you can go on the Internet and google "Romanian Rummy rules". These are the rules I grew up with and they are quite different from the Rummykub rules (but use the same set of tiles to play). Enjoy! :)
