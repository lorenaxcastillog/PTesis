 To be honest we really didn't have high hopes for this toy when we initially purchased it for our nephew as a birthday gift. He's 2 Y.O. and at the time it was hard to tell what he'd like most. We decided to go with this, and it was one of the presents he opened up half way through the rest. We were so surprised with how much he loved it! Every other present after, he just completely ignored and went back to this car. He loves being able to push it around and the sounds are great. They can be a little bit loud but that's fine. 4 months later and this is still his favorite car! This is a great toy and I recommend it to anyone with small children
