 My 1 year old granddaughter got this bear for Christmas. And it has not worked right except for that day. After reading all the reviews I am beginning to think that I just happened to purchase a bad one. Of course, she is not at the age that she can use this toy herself. But we took it out of the box and turned it on for her, the voice startled her at first, but she has gotten used to it. The next day we turned it on for her and it was skipping pages. We took the batteries out and put in new ones and I turned it on for her today and now it just keeps repeating page one. I have older grandchildren that are very rough and have kept TJ out of their reach because I am afraid they will break his arms. Has anyone else had any problems with this toy? I am afraid to buy any more books until I see if Hasbro will replace this bear with another one and see if it works
