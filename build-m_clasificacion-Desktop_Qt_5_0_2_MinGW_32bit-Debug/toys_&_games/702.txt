 I have 6 kids and the 5 that are old enough to play with these babies LOVE them. The boys (3,5,and 7) and the girls (2 and 5) all play with them day in and day out. They go everywhere. Right now we only have 2 babies and the care center. There is a bit of fighting for them, so for Christmas I am buying the checkup center with baby and additional babies so there is enough to go around. These are one of their favorite things to play with and they are worth more than the cost! When my 2 month old daughter was born it was great to see my 7 year old son wrapping up one of the babies and mimicing me. I love to see that my boys are learning to be loving and nurturing as well as my girls. My only wish is that in addition to the girl/boy twins they offer, they should offer boy/boy twins
