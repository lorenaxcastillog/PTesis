 I purchased this kitchen last Christmas for my girls. When it arrived, both my husband and I were amazed at the quality. Assembly instructions(although it takes a few hours) were very clear and all of the parts and pieces were color coded and numbered. I consider this piece to be "furniture quality." To top it off, it is absolutely adorable and my girls (2 and 4) love to play with it. It is definitely the type of piece that can be passed down from generation to generation. If you are considering purchasing some of the kitchen sets from the pricier mall/catalog stores (you KNOW which ones I am talking about), consider this first.
