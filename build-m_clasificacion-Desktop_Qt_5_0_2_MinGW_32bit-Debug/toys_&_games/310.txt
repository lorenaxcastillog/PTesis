 This is a single player game. Set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic. The puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated. By the end, the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before. Both kids love it- ages 4 and 9. We helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking "Whoes in that cars way?" Then "whoes in the trucks way?" until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards
