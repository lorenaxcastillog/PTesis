 My son got this game as a gift. I brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day. The kids love this game and request it over and over. Many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes. It is a great vocabulary builder. I also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them. I use these when we are studying parts of speech -- they have to come up with a noun (adjective, verb, etc) that begins with that letter. This is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting
