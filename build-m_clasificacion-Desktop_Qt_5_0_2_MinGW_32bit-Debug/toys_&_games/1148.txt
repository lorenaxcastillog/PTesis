 Okay, I would not recommend this doll because she grew black mold inside her suit and around her legs. Yes, she does have a loop so that you can hang her up but she really doesn't get dry. So . . . after a few months, the little lady grew mold. I always squeezed her body so the water would squirt out the holes of her feet to drain her too but I guess we just weren't able to get her dry enough. The mechanism for the shower is very difficult for a young child. It's hard for them to attach the fish to the tube and then squeeze to activate the shower mechanism. Well, the doll now sits in my garage and the fish is a nice chewing toy for my 16 month old daughter
