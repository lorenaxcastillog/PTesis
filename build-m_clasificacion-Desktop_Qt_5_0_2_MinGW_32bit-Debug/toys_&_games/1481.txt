 My son is rough on his things and he loves puzzles. Most of his puzzles don't last long, but his Ravensburger puzzles are holding up very well to his abuse! They are very sturdy and do not peel or bend easily and they aren't full of that puzzle dust when you open them. The pictures on Ravensburger puzzles are top quality and beautiful. We absolutely love this Noah's Ark puzzle. 60 pieces is perfect for my four-year-old at this point. The pieces are a great size for his little hands. Also, I would like to note that the Ravensburger 100 piece puzzles are better than many others for younger kids because they design the pieces larger and sturdier than many other brands
