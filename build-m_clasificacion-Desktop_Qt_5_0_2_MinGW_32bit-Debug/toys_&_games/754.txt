 This game is really great and I highly recommend it. My 3-yr old girl and my 7-yr old boy both really enjoy it. Even though my daughter doesn't know all the characters, she can search by color and match the pictures on her bingo card to the pictures on the screen. Because it's random anyone can win which, of course, the kids love. This is also great for grandparents who know nothing about Nickelodeon characters and want a fun, low-key game to play. Spongebob does a little video tutorial in the beginning, so there are no difficult instructions to understand. That also means it takes just a couple of minutes before you're actually playing. There are little montages throughout (like 2-min. shorts) featuring various characters to keep their attention. We can and will play this again and again. They should come up with a version with magnetized chips so we can play in the car
