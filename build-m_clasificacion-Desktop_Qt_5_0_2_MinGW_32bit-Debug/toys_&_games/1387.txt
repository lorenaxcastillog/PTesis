 Everyone wants to complain about how trivial and difficult the questions are, but have you ever played normal trivial pursuit? You have to be a major geek to get some of the questions right. I had a difficult time playing this, because i was not a baby boomer, and i come from the Darrel Hammond, Jimmy Fallon era. The farthest back I go are the Mango days. As for the game pieces, they chose some of the most memorable characters from the show to be featured on the pieces and gameboards. There are some memorable African American characters for sure, but the game company had to make a decision out of all of them! It would be challenging. I'm sure they pondered Gumby or Stevie Wonder or James Brown just to name a few. For anyone that has knowledge of only a few of the SNL seasons, you might want to refresh yourself by going over the Anthony Michael Hall days (I didn't even know he was on the show!). If you have limited knowledge, I suggest a game such as Scene It. It is much easier! A must buy for any SNL fiend! Good Luck
