 This tent works great in and out of the home. Great fortress within the home, or to get baby off the grass and sand outside. It takes up some square feet, but if you have the room, it is fun to play with. Assembly time is probably 5-10 mins for one person. With more use, I'm sure it can be assembled at a faster pace. One side stays open, but can be masked with a sheet or blanket (if you would like your baby to stay inside). My 9 month baby and I easily fit within the tent, with much room to grow. Easy disassembly. This tent does the job of getting baby out of the sun, and great place for naps when out. For this low price, nothing compares. Stows away neatly and easily in a small bag (approx 4x12 inches).
