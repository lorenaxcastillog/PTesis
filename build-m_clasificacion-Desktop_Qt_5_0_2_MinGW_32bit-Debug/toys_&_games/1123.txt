 My 2 year 4 month old daughter loves the Pirate Tub Time Adventure. She couldn't wait for me to take it out of the box. No more than a few seconds later she was asking for tub time. The boat floats well and the top lifts off to provide a convenient storage spot for Pablo and Uniqua. Pablo and Uniqua do plop out of the boat when bobbing along in the tub, but my daughter loves "saving" them from the torrent-laden waters. She has been playing make believe with this set for hours on end. She doesn't want to leave home without the two backyardigans either. It has made entertaining her a snap. This toy also can be thought of educational in the sense that it helps her develop imagination and tactile skills. She's learning how to put the removable sail back in--- basically she's learning a dexterity task with that. The only sad thing is she wants to know where Austin, Tasha, and Tyronne are.
