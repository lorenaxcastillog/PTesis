 Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better. Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom. took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank. Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great! Do not put fish in the shark tank. They will die
