 I was shocked at how big this Horse Stable is! I had to run out and buy bigger horses! I bought the Melissa and Doug horses - 12 in a wooden box and after seeing the stable I thought those horses are way too small! Now we will have a family of horses for the stable. The Quality of the Stable is excellent! Worth every penny! Is it not cheap or flimsy. I can't say enought good things. And the Seller was excellent! I ordered it a the last minute as a Christmas gift and they got it here in record time!!!!!
