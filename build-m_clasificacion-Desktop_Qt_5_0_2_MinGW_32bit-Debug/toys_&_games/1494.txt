 Santa brought this for my two-year-old, who is learning her letters. She loves to play with this and loves drawing on the chalk board. I haven't let her have the dry erase marker yet, but she does have some dry erase crayons (from a craft store) that work really well on it. My only wish is that Melissa & Doug could make this a sliding case so there would be a place to store those 30+ magnets (ABCs + numbers) that inevitably get scattered. One nice thing is that the magnets are contained within the letters, not glued on the back, so it's impossible for the magnet to come off
