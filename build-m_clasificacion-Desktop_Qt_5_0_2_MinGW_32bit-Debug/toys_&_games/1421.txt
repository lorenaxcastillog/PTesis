 As a game, spelling primer, and spelling practice "free for all," this is overall a good value for money (shop around: $5 - $15 range is out there). A couple of BIG downsides when using the letter cubes for anything other than the supplied cards: 1) many simple words cannot be formed because needed letters are on the same cube, 2) all letters are not represented (not "cool" when your child can't even spell out his own name), very limited 3 & 4 word cards (trim 3x5 index cards to supply your own cards, but make sure the word can be spelled with the provided blocks!) It would be nice to have additional letter cubes available, especially to have all the letters!
