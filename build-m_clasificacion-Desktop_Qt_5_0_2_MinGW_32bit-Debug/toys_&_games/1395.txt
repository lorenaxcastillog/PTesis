 I think this toy is not educational at all. It is way to over priced and it breaks really fast. It is a usless toy thjat is expensive to buy but cheap when it comes to playing with it. I had bought one for my little sister for christmas and two day after she was playing with it, it broke so I thought ok maybe she did it so I took it and told them whant had happened and then I got anonther one for her then the next day it broke so it is really a cheap toy in my eyes. And you might say ooh.... your sister was too young to be playing with it well my sister is 14 years old. So that is my review for the Pottery Wheel
