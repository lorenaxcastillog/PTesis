 I ordered this ant farm for my grandchildren in July. The ants came the middle of August and they were all dead. They replaced the ants and I put them into the farm. The next day my Granddaughter started screaming that something bit her. I looked and there were red ants all over the floor and table. They had gotten out thru the air holes at the bottom. The company replaced the farm and the same thing happened again only this time I had placed the farm on a paper on a table so when they got out they could not get out from under the farm. I cannot get my money back because it is over the 30 day guarantee. I didn't get the first ants until after the 30 days. Do not buy this toy unless you want a huge disappointment and a big mess
