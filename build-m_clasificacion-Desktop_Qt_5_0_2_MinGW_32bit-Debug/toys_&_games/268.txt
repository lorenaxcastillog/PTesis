 This was the best therapy game ever. My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games. We mostly played it with their friends. I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me. I decided to bring it to a family gathering. I have always been distant with my eight siblings. The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect. then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played. We had a total awakening of how we see each other. We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful. This game is the best. We laughed so hard we ached the next day. We played till 2:00 a.m. Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home. We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together
