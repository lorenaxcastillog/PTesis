 My son recieved this as a christmas gift and it is such a great toy. At 14 months he smiled at the animal sounds, and the animals we the perfect size to hold and explore. Now at 19 months he put the animals into their rightful places in the barn. (one side of the stall plays a horse sound the other, a cow) The pig gate also makes an "oinking" sound when opened. Also there is a rooster that needs to be slid in order to hear it's sound. My only complaint is the silo. It comes off too easily but we decided the silo doesn't HAVE to be connected to the barn. My son uses it as a hide and seek center(putting the animals into the top opening and the door closed, then opening the door to see if the animals indeed were still there) Since the back is opened, I can sit behind and do a "puppet show". It is defently a cute toy but the animals have such "weird" hair - ha-ha..
