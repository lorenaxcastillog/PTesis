 The decline of Western Civilization. Ah how I used to love Playdoh with its basic colors and a smell that was uniquely its own which was almost intoxicating. In the true American tradition of companies not leaving well enough alone the formula of Playdoh has recently been changed and the substance no longer has the wonderful smell it used to have. To add insult to injury the basic colors of the old Playdoh set have changed in hue. I am sure kids will still have fun playing with stuff but gone are the good old days of Playdoh. If Coca-Cola can come out with Classic Coke why can't this company come out with classic Playdoh? Jim Connell "Hallstatt Prince
