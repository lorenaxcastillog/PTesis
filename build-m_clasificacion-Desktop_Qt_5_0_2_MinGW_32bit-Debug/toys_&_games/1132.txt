 I bought this toy for my 2 year old grandson's birthday. He's in love with the "Cars" movie but unfortunately many of the movie's toys are not appropriate for his age group. This plush toy is great for him and seems to be very durable. He tends to be rough on things but the toy is holding up very well. It's also very cute and says some FUNNY things. For younger children, I feel the toy is well worth the money, but I think kids older than 3 would get bored quickly. Mater is cuddly and can talk but that's about it
