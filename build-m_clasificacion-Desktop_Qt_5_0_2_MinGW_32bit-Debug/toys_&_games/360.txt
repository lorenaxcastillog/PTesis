 I was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday! Unfortunaty our version wasn't like the version I had when I was young. For some reason the people stand didn't open or close very well. So while for some you could smack down, others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat. Not only that but when we would start a new game, you're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out. Well for the red board they didn't flip so well, in fact only a few would flip up with out help. That could have been my fault when I put the pieces together. The game was still fun, althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she's glad of who she got because she likes her hat. Although I didn't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly,(like you're soppose too) I still love this game and forever will.
