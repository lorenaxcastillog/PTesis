 Damn! I just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks. At first I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking. In other words, I've been trying pretty hard to break it. For it's price, the yostick is incredible fun. In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts. A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all. The movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls. The ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground. Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy It
