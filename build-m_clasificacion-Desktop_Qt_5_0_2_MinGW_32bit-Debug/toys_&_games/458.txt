 I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her. I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender! I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter. It was an easy fix with some super glue. I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
