 I stumbled upon this game years ago, and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game. This past year, I decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom. I must say...WOW. I allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the Frog Juice. They would even play it over other outdoor games at recess. Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash. The kids LOVED it. So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year. To any educators who might be reading this, it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all. Plus, it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far as games go
