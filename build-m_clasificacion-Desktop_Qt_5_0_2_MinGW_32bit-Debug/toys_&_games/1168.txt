 Quality isn't too bad. All holes lined up. Materials are solid. A couple of small issues keeping this from being 5 stars. 1) Amazon is incorrect in their description, there is no vinyl seat. Just the metal, see the picture. 2) the red paint was missed on a couple of spots and has started flaking right out of the box. Took about 30 minutes to set up for one person, half that if I had a helper. Compared to the plastic cars and trucks this one is a winner. By the way I picked this up on an amazon sale day, got it for fifty something with free shipping. Given that this is a 35lb it's a bargain. Cheer
