 I just wanted to share with everyone that this is one of the best educational toys that you can purchase for a little one. I got this for my son Cameron last year for Christmas. We just love this toy. He can play alone. He can listen and watch the story on tv or after listening to the story he can go back and it will ask him about the story line on a certain page or asks him about objects and he has to pick the correct answer...very entertaining. I am hoping they come out with more stories besides the first 8 that were introduced. I am surprised that this toy has been reduced on sale. I think they need to remarket the product and have more stories to offer in the future as long it still works on this original player. This is a great toy to buy for a child that loves stories or reading.A++++++++++++++++++++++++
