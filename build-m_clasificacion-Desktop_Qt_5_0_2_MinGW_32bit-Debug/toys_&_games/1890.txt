 I love playing Trivial Pursuit Junior. The questions are made for kids, so just from going to school for 7 years I can figure out many of the answers. I don't reccommend getting this for kids of different ages to play together, though, because the older person almost always wins. Like other people said, once you play the game about 10 times you end up memorizing most of the answers, and it would be much appreciated if Trivial Pursit made a booster pack of cards. The only other bad thing about the game is that the cardboard wedges get bent from handling them
