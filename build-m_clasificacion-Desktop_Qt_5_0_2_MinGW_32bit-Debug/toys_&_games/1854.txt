 This was a great idea for my 2 kids for Christmas, I thought. Unfortunately the Giga was a hassle to inflate with about 15 air chambers took close to an hour to fill. Then our first time pushing the kids around with 2 friends (only one child in at a time. Each kids weight was under 80lbs. It is rated up to 150lbs.) the one air chamber ripped at the seams. I now have a giga ball that was used 1 time with duct tape holding one panel together. It ripped on 3 of the four sides holding it together. Most of the chambers are held by 5 seams. This chamber was right by one of the two openings. So my Giga Ball experience was pretty flat
