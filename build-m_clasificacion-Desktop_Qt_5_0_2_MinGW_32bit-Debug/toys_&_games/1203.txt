 Carcassonne is an excellent game that is not only simple and fun to play, but chock full of strategy and planning. The game is great for family and friends, and simple enough to teach to the kids. It takes about an hour to play, so it's good for that after dinner game, or whenever you don't have multiple hours to play. That said, the game is fun and diverse enough to play several games back to back when you do have several hours at hand. As simple as the game appears, there's a lot of strategy that can get involved in the placement of your Meeples. You can spend the game trying to look like you're working on your own territory, hoping the other players don't notice you trying to rob them of their end-game points. There is a bit of luck that comes into play, and it can wreck your genius strategy, but that's the fun of the game. I highly recommend this game to any board gamer, to anyone thinking of playing board games, or to any gamer trying to recruit friends and family into the joys of non-electronic games
