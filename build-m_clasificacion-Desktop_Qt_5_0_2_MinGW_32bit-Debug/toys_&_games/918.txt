 You deal the cards, show the green apple card, everybody turns in a red apple card, and hilarity ensues. Each hand inspires discussion and chuckles. I liked the variations suggested in the instructions, such as dealing all green (adjective) cards and finding the best match for a red (noun) card, or trying to find the least-fitting match, or just turning in a red card blindly before seeing what the green card says. The judge can determine how to play the hand, and my favorite part, the decision of the judge is completely arbitrary, meaning you can pick whichever card you like. It's easy, fun, and a game can be as long or short as you like. There is a lot of shuffling involved, since you will go through a lot of cards quickly, so have someone on hand who knows how to shuffle a deck of cards. Recommended
