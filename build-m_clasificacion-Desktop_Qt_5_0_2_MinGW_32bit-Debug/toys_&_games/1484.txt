 I bought this LEGO toy because we've had several MegaBlocks sets and they fall apart over and over again as you build them. I hoped LEGOs would be better, but they're not. When built, the fortress stands only 12 inches by 12 inches, so the scale is small and you can't really play with it, given the fact that one wrong move sends the whole thing crumbling. My son is 7 and an experienced LEGO user, but even he said, "Oh, man! This is as bad as MegaBlocks." This is going to end up in our LEGO box as spare parts, which is sad considering we paid $39.99 for it.
