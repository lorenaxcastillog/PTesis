 The Playmobil Pirates sets are perfect for young children with vivid imaginations. This is my 4 year old's favorite toy. We spend countless hours sailing the high seas together. He has selected the 'skeleton' from the Pirate Island set as his own personae and we call him Captain Bones. The ship is very well made and has withstood many dramatic battles against "the bad pirates". The details are what he most enjoys, like the treasure, swords, goblets, lamps and other small items that come with these sets. Whenever I chase down Captain Bones with the shark figure, trying to take a bite of his boney leg, my son laughs with joy. And that makes this set my favorite toy as well: most of the time I am watching him and the smiles rather than the pirate my son has assigned me. You will get months and months of use out of this set
