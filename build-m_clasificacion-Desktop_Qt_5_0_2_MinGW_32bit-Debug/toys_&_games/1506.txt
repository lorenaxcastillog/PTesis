 I bought these for my son when he was a little over three months old... just about the age when he was starting to grab. They're perfectly sized for baby's hands to explore. The variety of textures on the toys seemed to fascinate him, and he loved to swing them back and forth, suck on them, and play with them while in his car seat. His fave is the elephant -- great for distracting him for a few minutes! It's also handy that you can attach to them to a baby gym, but frankly, I rarely did; they are handy in the diaper bag for when we travel, or (now that he's creeping), roll-around-the-floor time. They've held up well and now -- at nearly 7 months old -- my son still thoroughly enjoys them
