 I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. On the day after Christmas, I helped my son assemble this product. It worked flawlessly for the first day. The next day, I turned it on to show the boys' grandmother. Apparently, the steel ball "wheels" under the "riders" don't roll very well after initial use. The riders would be hoisted to the top, but would fail to slide onto one of the chutes. If they did make it onto a chute, they would sometimes fail to glide all the way to the bottom, or would fall off the chute. The failure rate went from 0% when first used to about 90% after the first day. I've purchased other K'nex items before and never had a problem
