 I truly enjoy playing this game with my 5 year old. She has greatly improved her reasoning skills while playing this game and asking yes or no questions about their physical appearance to deduce the character on my card. It helps her observation skills and, it has also exposed her to pictures of people of differing ethnicity. That allowed us to have a conversation that helped me teach her how to properly and politely describe their appearance, potentially avoiding embarassing episodes down the road. You never know what a child that age will say and where they will say it, so it was an unexpected benefit of this game for it to lead to that conversation
