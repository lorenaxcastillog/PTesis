 I bought this swing to put on the new variety climber swing set extension that we just bought. My 7 month old and 22 month old fit perfectly in it. When my best friends 20 month old boy came over to try out the new play set he just bairly fit. He is not an overweight toddler, just tall and muscular. There is no way a bigger kid would fit. So I am going tomorrow to buy the little tykes high back toddler chair for our bigger guests. One really nice feature about this chair is that it has a 5 point harness belt. That is really comforting. I really feel that my babies are safe sitting in it.
