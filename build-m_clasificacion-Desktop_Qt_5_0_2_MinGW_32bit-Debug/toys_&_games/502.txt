 I've got this thing for my twins for NE=ew Year, and they've been enjoying it for one day so far. We have two sets, and it's much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots is indeed a deathwish. I don't know how durable it will prove - the robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects, but it's only been one day. One drawback I found is the toy's inability to go shooter on shooter - for some reasons pistols, when set on team A and team B, refuse to shoot one another. But it's a fun toy nevertheless. The only educational value I can discern in this set is a little bit of understanding of just how stupid the computers are, and may be the realization that the light "bullet" gets reflected off white surfaces, so the robot canshoot you even when its back is turned toward you. Otherwise, not eductaional at all. Thankfully :)
