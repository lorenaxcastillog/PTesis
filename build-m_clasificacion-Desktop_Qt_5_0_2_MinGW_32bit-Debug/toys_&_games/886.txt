 This toy box as well of the rest of the mission set from Little Tike is excellant!! The quality is superperb. All pieces are solid wood not cheap veneers...the only exception is the hollow core toy box top WHICH MAKES SENSE!!! I would not want a solid oak toy box top of that size slamming on my 6 year old, 3 year old, or 1 year old's head. There is also a divot in the top edge of all sides so than fingers don't get pinched. The top still holds all three of my children with no problem, a combined weight of 120lbs. I am very happy as well with the table and chair set and and the storage cabinet. I plan to pass these on to my grandchildren, they are commercial quality. Eri
