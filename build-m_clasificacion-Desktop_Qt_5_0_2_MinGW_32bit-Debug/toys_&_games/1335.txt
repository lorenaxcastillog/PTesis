 This is a premature and overly ambitious design. My 7 year old is a gifted builder, and worked on several K'nex building models easily, and begged for something more challenging. When I bought this most expensive and supposedly most advanced model from Toysrus, I expected it would give fun not only in building, but also in motorized operation as the box claimed. I was totally disappointed. The whole system appeared weak and shaky, the sliding connections are not smooth, the riders get easily stuck at anywhere, or fall off. It is not broken yet, but it can never operate a full round without some manual assistance. The system also looks cheap and clumsy. It now occupies a big corner of the room, and is waiting to be disembled. We will leave it there for a few more days, only to sooth the boy's remorse for his effort in building it. My recommendation is, buy it only if your life is overwhelmingly happy, so you need to balance it by spending $80 to buy a few days of frustration
