 I was sucked into "playing" this a few years ago at a retreat weekend. It was the only "game" that still had all its pieces. After having experienced it, I know why. It never stayed out of the box long enough to lose its bits. Now, granted, I'm not an overly communicative type of guy. But I enjoy games, and when my talkative friends wanted to play, I was willing to give it a shot. By 5 minutes into it, even they were bored and were looking for excuses to leave. We moved on from pretending to go around the pointless board to just rifling through the questions for any good ones. The whole experience lasted all of ten minutes before we put it away. I've played fun communication games. There is a point and a purpose in playing those games: You can win. There is no win scenario in this "game". Did War Games and WOPR teach us nothing? If there is no winner, what's the point in playing
