 We thought it was a lot of set up. The lab did not seem stable. My 9 year old could not snap the mold covers on and the molds did not fill up all the way with the mix, which left him with 1/2 of a gummy worm. It was messy, awkward and not worth the money we paid for it. It is in the trash. We wouldn't buy another one. Also the piece that is used for the mixing - what an odd design. And I could barely pull it apart to clean it to make another batch. Save your money and buy the supplies to make the goodies in a bowl at home
