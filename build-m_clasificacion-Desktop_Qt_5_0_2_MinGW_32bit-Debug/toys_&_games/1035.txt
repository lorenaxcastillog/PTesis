 I would have paid double for this toy! My daughter has been intriqued with this toy for 7 months now!It has so many activities...she plays with it everyday. I like how the activities relate to her milestones...for example, it has a light switch on it with a real working light. She loves turning the lights on and off. She is always opening and closing doors, and this offers that to. There is a pleasant noise or music for almost every activity. I am just so surprised that it has captivated my child for such a long time.. and it continues to do so.
