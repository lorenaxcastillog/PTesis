 I purchased this toy as a gift for my 5 year-old nephew and it was a big hit. He had received many other gifts but had to open this one right away and start playing with it. He and 2 other children spent quite a while drawing on it toghether...all boys.It was nice that it was something they could play with together. I had purchased the toy not realizing that you could open the head to pull out a brain and the chest to pull out a heart ect. I was initially not too comfortable with this feature of the toy. However, when the boys played with it, they initially laughed at the parts and then paid little attention to them. These parts are not very realistic looking were good for a quick chuckle. My nephew continues to play with it frequently and it washes well. I have suggested it to a few other people with young boys
