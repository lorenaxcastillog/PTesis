 We just purchased this game for our 3 1/2 year old daughter and she got pretty bored with it after a few rounds of placing beans on top of the pot. Explaining how the game works doesn't really matter - she just thinks that if the beans fall on her side, she wins! That alone is priceless. I like the fact that this game teaches her to wait her turn when she's playing with someone and to only place one bean at a time - for patience. I played with this game as a kid, and it seemed that the entire plastic pot and holder is so much thinner and lighter than 30 years ago. I guess that comes with technology and newer raw materials. On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this toy a 5. It has to be a great toy if it's been around for 30 years! Just keep things simple for your little ones - they may not engage in this toy for more than 30 minutes, but it's better than alot of the other games out there for 3 year olds.
