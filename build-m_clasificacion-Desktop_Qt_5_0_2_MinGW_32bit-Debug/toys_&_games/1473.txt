 My 2 year old has struggled with the concept of addition ever since his exodus from the womb. Leapfrog seems to be one of the few companies in corporate America that cares as their cutting edge product the Twist & Shout has worked miracles for my child. The random quizzes and raucous electronic voice both work to subdue my child into hours of learning, laughs and all around good times. He'll one day be telling the tale of this product to his grandchildren, with a broad smile across his then wrinkled face, fondly recalling what toys were like "back in the day". Let your youngins share the same future pleasures by buying them one of these today.
