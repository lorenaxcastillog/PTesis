 I am using this tunnel for dog agility. Now I know these are for kids but for all of us who need equipment for agility and get tired of paying hundreds of dollars, you start to look around at other solutions. This is a great durable tunnel. You can connect them together to get a long, perhaps competition sized tunnel for agility. Great price too. Would suggest weights just like any other tunnel to ensure it doesnt roll when the dog is in it or blow around too much. So even though it is for kids, dogs love it too!!
