 My daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it. This pool is big enough that I can just get in with her and we have a blast. Because of her age I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away. I was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for traveling to Grandma's house too! I would recommend this to anyone young and old
