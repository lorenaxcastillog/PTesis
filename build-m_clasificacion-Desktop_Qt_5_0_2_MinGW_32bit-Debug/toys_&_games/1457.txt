 The descriptions don't mention the creepy voice that says "It's lullabye time" before it launches into an seriously off-key rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Firefly (huh? was there a copyright problem with using "little star"?) You can press the moon button to skip the first song, so I didn't have too much trouble with this- most of the songs after the first are mercifully without vocals. Later on this same Robo-Mom also says "I love you", which is seriously spooky. Aside from this, the "amazing 3-D ceiling light" is really more of a rotating circular slide projection of some cartoon animals, and the bee-and- LED light show on the actual toy looks really old-fashioned. The nature sounds are ok, but I am pretty sure one of the sounds is "plank of wood tapping against another plank of wood". Even with all of this, I was still willing to strap it to my son's crib and see how he liked it- and within the first five minutes the projector light flickered on and off, and the Robo-Mom got stuck and kept saying "It's lullabye time" over and over.
