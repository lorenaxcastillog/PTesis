 I purchased this item when my daughter was one year old, and it was amazing! My daughter was always a good sleeper, but when she began teething at around 9-10 months old, she began refusing to stay in her crib each night. I was out of ideas, and my husband and I had tried just about every method we read about without success. Finally, I found the Tomy Star Bright Light, and it was like a miracle worker! The first night I used it, my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling. Each night, her sleeping became better and better. Now, we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep. It is a much better approach then allowing your child to "cry it out". She actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep.
