 I bought this as a Halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004. He loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house. He doesn't really use it much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it! He can actually follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time. This toy has been great for our family. It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has performed amazingly well
