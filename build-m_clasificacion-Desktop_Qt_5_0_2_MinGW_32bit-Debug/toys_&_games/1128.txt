 Do not even waste your time getting this. First of all it's very diffucult to get it to the proper consistency, not too watery that is slips off the spoon and not too thick or it won't go down her throat. Even my daughter thought it wasn't worth the hassell and said "let's just pretend". If you are lucky enough to get the right consistency and it actually comes out the other end (sitting her on the potty is another story), it takes a long time to all come out and then it's a pain to clean it up. Don't do it, I'm telling you
