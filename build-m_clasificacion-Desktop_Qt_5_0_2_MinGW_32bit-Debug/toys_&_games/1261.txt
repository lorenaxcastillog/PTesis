 The true Grimm Fairy Tale of Hansel and Gretel is not a pleasant picture that most interpretations show it to be. Here is a figure that shows the terror that should have filled little Hansel. As a stand alone figure, it's not the best of this series; alongside the Gretel figure, it gets twisted in its own right as it looks as though Gretel and not the candy witch is who tortures him. This one may be the most delicate of the set but is still another great rendered piece by the sculptor. On its own it only gets three stars, with the set, it moves up to four stars
