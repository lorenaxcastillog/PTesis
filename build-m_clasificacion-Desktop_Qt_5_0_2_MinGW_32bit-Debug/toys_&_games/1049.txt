 I have Fianna and she is very pretty!!!She is my favorite one in this collection. But when I opened the box to get her out,I saw the her ear on the left side doesn`t have an earring.I`ve looked arround everywhere in the box and I couldn`t find any earring.But I didn`t had a problem,because I have Meygan,and all the Midnight Dance dolls has the same earrings.So I swiched from Meygan to Fianna and the problem was solved. Anyway...This note is for everyone: You are going shopping.On your way you buy a doll.Before you buy it,you must check everything on it before you buy it.Maybe there is something wrong,something broken or something lost.I must be really carefull the next time when I am going to get Midnight Dance Roxxi(which is coming out very soon).I must be carefull with the earrings. So be carefull if you are going to buy a doll.You need to check on everything with the doll before you buy it. Anyway...This Bratz doll I`ve got is my MOST favorite Bratz doll I have!!!Great Job MGA!!!I hope that Roxxi will be great!!
