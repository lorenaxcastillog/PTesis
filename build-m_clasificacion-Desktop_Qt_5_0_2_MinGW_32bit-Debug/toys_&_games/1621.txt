 I purchased this for my son's 8th birthday. He was delighted. Unfortunately the excitement quickly faded when we discovered that two crown gears were not included in the box. I contacted the company and they quickly agreed to mail these to me. Two weeks later, the geers have not arrived. When contacting the company again, I was told that these were air mailed the day of my original contact and that I would now need to contact my "local dealer". A web site was provided. Unfortunately the local dealer is a full days drive away. This has resulted in a very disappointed boy and little confidence in the company or their customer relations
