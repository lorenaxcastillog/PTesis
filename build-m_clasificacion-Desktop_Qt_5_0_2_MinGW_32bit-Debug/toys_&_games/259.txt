 I can't say enough about Illustory! My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet. So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say. We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book! The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided). We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her! I highly reccomend this kit
