 My daughter got this doll for her first Christmas when she was [...] She is [...] now and still sleeps with "baby" every night. All 3 of my nieces also have this doll and loved it as well. It's a nice size, slightly smaller than most, and has a soft body. My daughter doesn't like to have clothes on her dolls, so my complaint is that the soft body is (was) white. It's filthy. I have machine washed it 2X, though I don't recommend. It's hard to get completely dry, and the material at the connections has weakened and has had to be sewn. The body shape has turned into a "pear," but my daughter doesn't seem to mind. The good baby powder smell is still there. Worth the cost
