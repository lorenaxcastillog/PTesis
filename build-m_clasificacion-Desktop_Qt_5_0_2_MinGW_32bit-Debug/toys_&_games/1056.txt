 I think it's important to give this to kids at the right age. I bought the book and fingerpaints for my son when he was 2, and he was not interested. BUT, he was not interested in ANY drawing/painting in general. He is 3.5 now, and he just found he old book digging through his stuff, and he is amazed with it - he finished it in one evening. He still doesn't like coloring with crayons - this requires too much patience - but paints are a different story. Fingerpaints are especially interesting for him because of the element of surprise - they are all white but appear in color on paper, and the delay in color apperance, while irritating at first, is now cool. Yes, the paints are a bit messy. No color, but they stay on face, clothes, ect., so again, make sure your child is not too young, and understands where the paint should go
