 My step-daughter and I recently had to take a fairly long flight with a 2-hour "lay-over". I bought this version of Yahtzee to take along since we both love the game. It was perfect for use on the flight because it was neatly self contained; dice, score sheets, padded dice shaker and well lined pocket to shake them in to. Since it was so easy to take anywhere, we rarely got bored when my husband had business to take care of. Watching her use strategy and taking what she learned from previous games was great.....it taught me a few things as well. This is a perfect travel companion. I'm buying another one for my son
