 We received this for Christmas (along with lots of other Chicco and other brand toys)and a month later - my kids still won't let me put Bear Ville away to rotate it with the others!! My 2 and 1/2 year old and 15 month do not tire of this toy - AT ALL!! It's a great toy, very durable and even I don't get bored sitting w/ them and playing with it day after day after day. We have a lot of the Fisher Price Little People stuff and the Little People toys just don't compare with Bear Ville. The kids lose interest w/ Little People but not Bear Ville. You really won't be disappointed with this toy! I just wish Chicco would make other Bear Ville type items! I'd buy every one!
