 This is a horrible excuse for a Jack-In-The-Box. I recommend this toy only if you want to disapoint your child. My son wanted a jack in the box for christmas, He is only three, and this is all he kept asking for. Well when all I could find was this one, I took it. Not realizing how bad it was. The item does not work for anything. You turn the handle, and no music. So you keep turning, and eventually you hear the song, and if you are lucky, it will open. Now that it finally opened, fun trying to close it so the "fun" will begin again. We told our son that it was a toy from the Island of Misfit Toys. I am now trying to find a metal toy that actually works
