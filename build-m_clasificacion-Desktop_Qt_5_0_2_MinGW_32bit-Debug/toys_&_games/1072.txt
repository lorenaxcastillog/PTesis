 The Polar Express set is really unique. The train is beautiful; the bell is a fun feature, and I love the way the scenery works. It's really clever, I think, to have the snowman and tree hold up the houses. Very unique and distinctive! The tunnel, like the Brio Mountain Adventure Figure 8 set's tunnel (which has the same shape but different coloration), is beautiful but a bit short. Our Maple Landmark Name Train and Little Engine That Could have clearance issues with it, but that's pretty common since they're so tall. My big beef with this set is that there are no magnets on the engine. In order to connect the engine to another train, one must hook the engine to its tender and use the tender for the connection. A bit frustrating, particularly if you're a kid who just wants to hook a train up. Still, as I said, this set is very unique, and its combination of features makes it irresistible desipte the drawbacks
