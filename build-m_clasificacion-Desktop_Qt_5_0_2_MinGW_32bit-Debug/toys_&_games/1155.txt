 I give this ball pit 4 stars because my niece loves it! However, I would agree that it looks bigger than it is after you get it blown up - and you do need more balls! I bought this for my 13 month old niece - and she absolutly loves it - however after only 2 months with it - it is starting to rip at the seams in some areas - this could be due to the fact that she doesnt care to use the door on it - she just climbs over the edges. However, i gave it 4 stars because it is one of her favorite places to play - its like her little playhouse! Also great buy since I have amazon prime and didnt have to pay for shipping!!
