 My 5 year old daughter, who has seen me return home from the pottery studio with my works in hand, was really excited to received her own pottery wheel for her birthday. We were both greatly disappointed to find that the wheel power was so insufficient that each time she even gently placed her hands on the clay, the wheel came to a grinding halt. Given this, it was impossible to even teach her the basics of centering clay, let alone create any sort of thrown piece. I did not expect this to work as well as the wheels I use, but I did expect that she could at least learn a few fundamental skills. This product was completely disappointing and I would not recommend it, particularly if there is no parent with throwing experience. If this is the best product out there, I recommend sticking to hand building with clay--they can learn to thrown on a wheel when they are old enough to go to a proper studio
