 My daughter loves this game, along with the few others she has, like the Care Bears, Winnie the Pooh, Alphabet Game, Lion King and the older cartridge: Little Mermaid. She got it for her birthday and has figured out how to play them very quickly! I'm impressed! I think for a learning tool this has been a great help for her. She has speach impairment and it has made learning fun for her. I find it better than the PS2 games that my husband plays that she has taken a liking in. It's more her age and not just mindless games. It makes them think and they can learn all at the same time. It gives us something both to sit down and do. As a learning tool I find it well worth the money, well with the time put into it to play it
