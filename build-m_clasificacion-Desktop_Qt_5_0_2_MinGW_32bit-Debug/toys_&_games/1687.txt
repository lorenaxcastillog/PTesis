 CARS was one of my favorite movies of 2006. There were a lot of characters from the film that I liked and related to, but the star of the film was the main racer himself, Lightning McQueen. This little car is a spitting image of McQueen. The car itself is slightly bigger than a Hot Wheels and seems to be made of a lightly stronger alloy than a Hot Wheels as well, but it is about the same size in length. The wheels are also a little stronger than a Hot Wheels. I bought one of these for myself as a display for the office, but I know several preschool children who play with some of these little Lightnings and they love them. A good toy for any fan of CARS
