 This was a Christmas purchase in our house this year and we have found the game to be incredibly fun from the familiar classic level to the very strategious advanced level. The one drawback that we have found is the annoying fact that the pegs do not fit well in the vertical grid board and are always falling out, or in the case of the planes are sometimes impossible to get out without the pliers that we keep handy when we play. There are four holes on the grid that are part of the support pegs and these holes will not hold a peg for anything. This really detracts from an otherwise superb game
