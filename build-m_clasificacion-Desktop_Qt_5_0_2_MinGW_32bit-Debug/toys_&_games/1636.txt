 This is a great toy, the details and structure are superb, the product parts are strong and durable, the figurines are by far a better design and more enjoyable for kids to play with than any lego figurines, each figure is an individual character with changeable parts, the toy is not a building block toy and the boat won't fall apart or be broken into pieces by a young child,this product would make any 4 to 6 year old extremely happy, my four year old is a big fan of the entire megablok pyrate collection; and like most parents I don't mind spending money on a toy that will be used and enjoyed.
