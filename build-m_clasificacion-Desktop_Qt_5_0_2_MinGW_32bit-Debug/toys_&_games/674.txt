 This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute
