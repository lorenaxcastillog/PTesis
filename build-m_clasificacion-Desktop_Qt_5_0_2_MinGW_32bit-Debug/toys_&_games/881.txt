 When I went into Toys R Us today merely to check for new Barbie clothes for my Pullip dolls, I had no intention of buying this lovely girl. I skimmed through the Bratz section just to see what was there. My companion pointed out the Yasmin Kidz doll, and I thought she was very cute, but not my cup o' tea. I searched for a Cloe since she's my favourite- *Points to Cloe army* -and found her. I promptly fell in love. Her hair is very pretty, it reminds me of Sun-kissed Cloe's hair, minus the braids. Her face is very cute, and I like her body proportions. The clothes are well made, and she's the perfect size for carrying around. I cannot recommend her enough! If you like Cloe, you should defidentely get this girl. -Taff
