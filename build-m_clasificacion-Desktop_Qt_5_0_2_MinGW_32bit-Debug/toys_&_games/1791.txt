 We got this bed for our toddler daughter after having tried every other silly trick to try and transition her from co-sleeping to her own bed. This bed worked IMMEDIATELY and she hasn't been in our bed since the very night we got it and assembled it. Yes, it takes awhile to blow up but once it is done, it holds the air remarkably well. Who cares if it looks like a "raft"...it keeps my child excited for bed time in her OWN bed and it keeps her from falling out of bed at 3 AM. WELL worth the price, and WELL worth what it looks like for now. It's a great, inexpensive item to transition your toddler from infant to "big kid" bed.
