 Nothing new to add here as far as a review of the bed - it's a great bed and it is very easy to put together. Our son LOVES his new "racecar bed" and took right to it. This commentary was to clarify an earlier review stating that stickers were not included. Ours DID have the stickers included as shown in the picture, which are for the wheel covers only. The stickers might be easily missed when opening the parts, as they were attached to a piece of cardboard that was in the bag that contained the screws and hardware
