 I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday, since he is a construction truck fanatic. After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for the minor tweaking that this toy required (ie, taking apart the locking mechanism, which is VERY EASY if you follow the other reviewer's advice). This is a definite must, as my son was frustrated immediately with the toy as the manufacturer made it. BUT after the locking mechanism was removed this toy is incredible and he plays with it in the sandbox all the time. It is BY FAR his favorite toy and has held up to the wear and tear of the sand pretty well. Great buy and one very cool toy
