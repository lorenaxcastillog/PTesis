 This is the most hilarious board game you could ever play! It's great at your next party, family gathering, or get together with close friends. I was completely entertained and enthralled with the secrets that were revealed about some of the people closest to me. I learned things about my brother-in-law, for instance, that I just never would have believed! What a nut! Just a fun, amusing, down to earth game to play; I've played it numerous times, both with people who have played before, and newcomers, and it only get's better each time. And of course, it incorporates drinking in a way that only makes it more enjoyable. The secrets really start coming out only after a few turns. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good board game and a lot of laughs
