 We keep this one at our "other" home in California (where my family lives) so that when we travel, our son has everything that he needs for some creative Playdoh time without having to buy a whole new bunch of Playdoh accessories or carting stuff along. It is totally self contained and the "table" function of the box makes it great for a fussy grandmother who worries about Playdoh mess in her kitchen! My son can play with all of the tools and design toys, keeping everything on the blue "tabletop", then pack it all away again when we're finished with no fuss. We LOVE this product.
