 Before my 3 year old was born I saw these and bought them, I thought the were just too cute. When she was a tiny baby she liked to lick and suck on them, as she grew she played with them occasionally. The items inside were not as interesting to her as I thought they would be. The toy did not engage her, though her older sister enjoyed playing with them from the ages of 4-6. I just packed up my set and will be donating them to her school. I thought she would have become more engaged with them by now. Would make a great gift idea, but never know if it will be THE toy. Don't be disappointed if you child seems less than interested. As a parent, I loved them
