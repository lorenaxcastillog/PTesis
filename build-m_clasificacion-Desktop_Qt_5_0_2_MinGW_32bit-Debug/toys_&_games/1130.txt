 I actually bought this for my 82 yr old mother - who called and said how delighted she was with the product. She especially likes the feature where she can type in partial letters and get possible solutions. She uses it to help her solve Jumbles as well. It's easy to use, has appropriate words and lots of choices. In fact, she asked me to order another one for her neighbor, who has tried many other types, but was never happy with them. Now he's a convert to this one as well. The only drawback, according to them, is the lid is a little flimsy and with lots of use, tends to come off. Other than that, they love it
