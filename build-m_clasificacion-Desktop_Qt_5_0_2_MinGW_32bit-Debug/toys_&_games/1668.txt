 We were Christmas shopping when we came across the doll/outfits. My daughter begged and begged for it till finally I'm like OK, OK, OK. I'll buy that for you NOW. You've been such a great girl and mommies wonderful helper. BIG MISTAKE. She only played with it two days tops. I bought her the doll and bought the soccor outfit seperate. She was frustrated that the back back wouldn't hold more of her stuff. Shoes wouldn't stay on and that she couldn't get her hair up into a pony. I figured that my daughter is almost 5 and really prefers more interactive games. Lesson learned here!
