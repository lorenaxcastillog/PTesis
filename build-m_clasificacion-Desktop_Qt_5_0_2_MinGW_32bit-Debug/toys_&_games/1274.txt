 I bought this tunnel to add variety to the railroad I am building for my grandson. He is only 2 so there is a lot he has yet to think of to do with it. He always enjoys watching the trains go through it. And he has even more fun making the little Brio people climb up the path, over the bridge and down into to or up out of it. It seems well made and I think it will hold up well. The only complaint I have (and my wife agrees) has to do with the built in sound effects. When the button is pushed to have the tunnel play one of several railroad related sounds, we have to cover our ears. It is LOUD! Our grandson loves noise. His favorite activity is to push the button... over and over again. It wears us out pretty quickly and we put it away for several days at a time. Over-all it is a fun toy and it should last a long time. I have not found a way to turn it down but I would love to do so, soon
