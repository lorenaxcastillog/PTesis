 My 1 year old was given this for his birthday. Some of the phrases are rude. The songs are sung off key. The rollers don't always play the special song when there are 3 of a kind lined up. The car sounds are enough to make me batty. I don't see where it is teaching the child anything since it might say any one of three things for each picture. Is it the number? Is it the shape? Maybe this time it's going to be the animal. The low volume setting is still too loud. The only reason I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my son likes this toy despite the fact that the loses interest after a few minutes..
