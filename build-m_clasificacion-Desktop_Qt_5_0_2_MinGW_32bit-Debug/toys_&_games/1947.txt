 my daughter got this bike for her 2nd birthday from her grandparents. When they called to tell us what they found we were excited. A bike that was for 18month and up. My daughter has been wanting a bike like her 3 yr old brother has and she is into everything dora it could not have been more perfect. She opened the present was so excited knew exactly what it was and it was easy to assemble. WE put her on and she could not reach the petals she cried. My daugheter is above adverage in height so when a bike says 18 months and up you would expect her to fit. It was very disapointing. NOw we are going to try to add blocks to the wheels but if you want a bike that a 2 yr old can ride make sure you take them to the store or measure to see if they fit don't go by the age on the box. When she grows it will be a great bike very well made.
