 This little puppy was our solution to our 2yr old's request for a puppy for Christmas. It is such a sweet little thing that I even find myself playing with it. She's a little younger than they recommend, but has no problems getting him to do all his tricks. "Abbie" sleeps at the end of her bed every night. We've had no problem getting the battery pack to stay in - just have to keep the fur out of the velcro. Our family was so impressed by how real it looks and sounds, yet it's not annoying thanks to the fact it turns off after you leave it alone for a bit. I love that it doesn't have stiff robot legs so it is still cuddly and not too heavy. I really can't think of a better alternative to the real thing
