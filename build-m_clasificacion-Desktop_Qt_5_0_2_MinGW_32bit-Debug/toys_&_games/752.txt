 I purchased this for my [...] year old for christmas and we love it. I am always looking for fun educational things for her to do on the computer and this is a gem. Once you purchase the stuffed pet of your choice you register it online and a virtual version of that pet appears on the computer. The kids can earn money playing games etc. They then can build rooms in the house for there pet, take him to the doctor,go shopping etc. In this world of computer dangers this item is excellent and great fun for her, We love it
