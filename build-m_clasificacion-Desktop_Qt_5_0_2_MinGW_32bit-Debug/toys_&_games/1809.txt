 My daughter recvd this for x-mas from her grandpa and she is to keep this toy at his house for her to play with when she comes to visit. We were over there this past fathers day and she was playing with it i agree the soccer ball eraser does not erase all the way and to me was irratating, to her she didn't seem to mind. I don't think my daughter had any problems w/ the pen b/c if she did i would definately know! When we were leaving she was not done drawing and wanted to take it w/us which we would not let her and she kind of had a fit. oh well life goes on!:) over all i think this is a durable toy and definately a good thing to maybe bring out in the car when you run errands or on a long road trip where they can draw and amuse themselves
