 I have two major complaints with this toy... 1. It is not durable at all. My boys have not had much time to play with this toy yet, but there are all already plastic pieces broken off of the vehicle just from moving it around under the tree. 2. There are a number of pieces included with this toy, and the vehicle itself is too small to store the accessories. It seems to be poorly built and poorly designed. The only reason I gave it two stars was for the alien forms that can be made in the beaker. This toy won't last long at our house before it sees the recycle bin.
