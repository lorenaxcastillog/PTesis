 This product is not the best ever created, as the Roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of Bratz dolls. She has huge black and red streaks in her hair, as well as an oddly-shaped head. However, one gets used to her and can even find her pretty. The stage itself is a great product, but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think. This playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular Rock Angelz microphone, as it is gray and of a different style. Also included is a faux-snakeskin chair, Roxxi, a guitar, and a few accessories, like bottled water and make up compacts. The stage itself is rather nice, and I strongly suggest the Instrumentz if you buy this. However, be warned that it is not the BEST of Bratz products, despite its appeal. It's rather nice, though. :
