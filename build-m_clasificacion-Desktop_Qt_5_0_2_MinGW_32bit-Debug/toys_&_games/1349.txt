 My daughter is two, almost 3 in 3 months. She likes it well enough, but the fact that the paint takes a moment to react and show up is frustrating for her. I love that the paint is inclosed in the brush, but is difficult to get out to paint with and I hesitate showing her she can squeeze it. The whole point was to keep it in the brush, yes? Perhaps if they had caps to prevent it drying out and the brushes could stay moist with paint? The paint comes out of one place, so its all concentrated in the center of the brush, so you will need to work it in the bristles, or have big globs of paint and go throught it faster. On a side note, the paint dries crunchy on clothes. Also, my local Target has this set with an extra brush, for 9.99 and Michaels has it for 11.99, and no shipping!
