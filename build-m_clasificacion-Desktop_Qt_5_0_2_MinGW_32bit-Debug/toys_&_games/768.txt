 The box says that this game is for 4-7 year olds. When my 4 yr old son got this last year we discovered that the box couldn't even read 30 years and up. Both my hubby and my brother tried to play this game unsuccessfully. The problem is that the pizza surface is too slick and the pieces will not stay balanced up there. The toppings though are really well made and Isaac had fun making pretend pizza with them but we were never able to play the game. it was a disappointment b/c it looked so cute. We bought Topple instead this year, which is the same concept
