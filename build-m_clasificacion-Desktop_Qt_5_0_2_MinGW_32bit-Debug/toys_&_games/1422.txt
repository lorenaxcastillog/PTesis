 I agree that the "game" is more learning vs playing per the directions. However, a little creativity and a fun, educational time can be had. The newest version that I play with my 3.5 year old son has us splitting the dice and taking turns rolling our dice with the goal of getting one of the word's letters. He has fun rolling and searching his lot even if he doesn't roll a needed letter. Plus he can easily handle 4 dice. When you roll a "needed" letter you place it in its place. The player who fills in the last letter "wins" and gets to spell out and say the word. Sometimes we make up our own songs about the winning word. This version easily keeps him happy for a half hour at a time and he has also played his own take on his own.
