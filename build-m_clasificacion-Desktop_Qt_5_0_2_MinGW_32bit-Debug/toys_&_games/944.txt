 I just had to add my review!....I want to make sure people know this toy is a piece of junk. Nothing about this stays together! I'm annoyed with putting it all back together. It will soon go to never never toyland. This is probably one of the worst toys my kids have ever gotten. My daughter is 4 and she can't even get the toy to stay together. It's just ridiculous! Meanwhile, my poor 2yr old son just cries because he wants lofty to go over the bridge but the bridge won't even stay up!....gggggrrrr Oh and finally i put one star only because zero was not an option
