 I bought this unit for my [...]daughter, and I must say I really enjoy it. It is well made, and has the common sense features needed for a [...], such as the encased cd-rom games, No scratches!!! (now I only wish Disney would do the same with there movies so I wouldn't have to buy 4 copies of each movie!) The unit comes with "Jumpin' Bean Island", and I bought Spongebob and the Disney Princesses, but I must say, the "Jumpin Bean island game is the best of the three. It's educational approach is very, very good, covering math, reading, memory, etc. Tow thumbs up from the Jay-man! Perhaps I could have just bought some educational games to play on my PS2, but then what would I do?!?!
