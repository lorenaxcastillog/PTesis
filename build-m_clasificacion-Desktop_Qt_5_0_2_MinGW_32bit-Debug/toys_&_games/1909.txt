 I brought this last Christmas for my daughter, and I also recommended a co-worker of mine to do the same since her daughter was also two years old. Two days after Christmas the two front wheels fell off while she was riding it and they continued to fall off every time she would drive off the sidewalk into a grassy area or bush. There's a plastic round piece that holds the two wheels in place, but this piece doesn't fit properly to prevent the wheels from coming off. Two weeks later I went to visit my co-worker at home and she was experiencing the same problem. I got so sick and tired of putting the wheels back on while my daughter was outdoors riding it that I don't let her ride it anymore. Not worth the money or the time! Buy the Dora Explorer Big Wheel instead, my daughter loves it and it's very durable
