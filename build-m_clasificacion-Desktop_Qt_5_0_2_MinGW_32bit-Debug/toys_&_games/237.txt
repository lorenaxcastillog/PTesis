 Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us. First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room. Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker. Machines have a mean burn monster. The rares are something else. Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode. And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect. Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field. Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned. I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot. In other words, buy it. This is worth the money
