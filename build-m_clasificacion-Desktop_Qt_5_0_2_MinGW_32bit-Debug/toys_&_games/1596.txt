 After quickly destroying 4 cell phones from the dollar store, I bought two of these cell phones for the younger 2 boys of our 4 children. I wish I had bought one for each of our children, ages 2-8. The phone allows you to record and play back a short message. We've had lots of fun getting creative with that feature. Also, about 30 seconds after you close the phone, it will ring back. It makes the phone seem more "real". I originally didn't buy this phone for our oldest two girls, ages 6 and 8, because I thought maybe it was too childish or too drab in color for them. But, they are constantly playing with these phones and I have been trying to find more locally, but have been unsuccessful so far. We added stickers to personalize the phones, so the girls could make theirs more "girly" that way. I've not seen any other toy cell phone as nice as this one
