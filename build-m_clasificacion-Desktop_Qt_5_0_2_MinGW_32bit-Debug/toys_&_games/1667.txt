 I gave this to my 2 year old daughter for Xmas and she absolutely loves it. It is almost as big as she is and it is very sturdy. She has been carrying it around all day saying Dora is her best friend. Very cute. I like that it comes with the dog, backpack and book. The only drawbacks are that it doesn't come with Boots, Dora's monkey sidekick, instead it has a dog. And Dora's hair isn't very even and there are a lot of long, straggly strands of hair I had to even up so they wouldn't get caught on anything. But all in all it is a great toy that I foresee getting played with a lot
