 We bought this doll for our 4 year old daughter for Christmas and three months later she still LOVES this doll!!! She thinks it is great that the doll cries, and giggles, and kicks her feet like a real baby. My daughter has the best time trying to figure out what will make the doll stop "fussing". Sometimes the doll wants a blanket, sometimes a bottle, and sometimes she needs a diaper change. It is a continuous mystery. The one draw back and this is from a parent perspective only my daughter doesn't see this as a problem. :-) The only draw back is the doll is somewhat loud and doesn't stop making noise until you figure out why she is crying or just turn her off. But overall I recommend this doll for any little girl that loves babies.
