 I love this puzzle! It is fun and challenging. I believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge. However I find that there is one problem with it. THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS TO TELL YOU HOW BIG THE PUZZLE IS AFTER YOU PUT IT TOGRTHER!!! I would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box. I am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle. If you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle I would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection
