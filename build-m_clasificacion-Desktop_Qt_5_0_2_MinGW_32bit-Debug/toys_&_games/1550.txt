 My daughter is 4 years old and LOVES to trace so I decided to by her the Doodle Pro Glow. From the outside it looked like a snap to wipe clean, what a mistake! First you have to make sure that your child does not smear the marker (which stains) all over the place, second they provide you with a tiny sponge (not the same as the picture on the box)and you have to wash it clean after every stroke across the board. I don't know about you but I get tired of running back and fourth trying to keep it clean. Third you then have to wipe the board clean with a dry cloth since the wet sponge never gets all of it off. Take my advice and pass up this toy and go for the simple Doodle Pro, much easier all around.
