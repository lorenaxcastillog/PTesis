 This toy was bought for my son (14 months) because he has an obsession with the phone. My son instantly LOVED this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and I'm on it. It is a great travel toy as well. Being in the armed forces, we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone. Sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness. My one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it, he broke the center button that flips the features. We returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online. I'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again
