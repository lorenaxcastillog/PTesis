 I can't say enough about these toys! They are so nicely made and feel great in your hands. Small enough to carry around and big enough for little hands. Great quality, sturdy and superior look. Collectors are buying these up like hot cakes and ebay is living proof that people are willing to shell out the cash for these. Especially for the ones that are harder to find. People have written reviews on these that no stores carry them. They have been sold out because there has been a rush on these toys even before the movie release. Hopefully as time goes on and if they keep producing them they will be easier to come by. That's what I am hoping for. I don't have all the characters yet and would like at least one of each for my son, maybe even more for collecting. Good luck on your search!
