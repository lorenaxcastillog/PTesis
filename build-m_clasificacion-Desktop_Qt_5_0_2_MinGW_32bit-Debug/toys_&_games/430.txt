 We have had this sandbox for five years. It has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love it. Color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years. Sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids. We tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly. It is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done. The kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it as well. I find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless. Overall good investment and the kids love it
