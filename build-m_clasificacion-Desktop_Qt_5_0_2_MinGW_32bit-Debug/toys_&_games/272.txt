 I got a wagon like this when i was really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries from the store. It is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends ride in it. It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home. It can go really fast and it's easy to steer. You have to be careful if you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it. One time my mom was pulling me and my sister to the store. When she went over the curb it tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot
