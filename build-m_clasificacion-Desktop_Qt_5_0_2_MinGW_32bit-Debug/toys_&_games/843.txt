 This is my first purchase of any outdoor play equipment and i am very pleased with it. i bought it for my 22 month old and was a little nervous at first about her falling off of the top. i watch her very closely but she seems to have mastered it. i like the high hand rails at the top opposed to others i looked at because it helps alot with them to hold onto while sitting down. the steps also seem to be at more of an angle opposed to other slides. my 22 month old has not been off it since and it is also great for my 4 year old. i don't have a yard, so this was a perfect toy for my children to have a little fun with limited space. i would definitely recommend this product! it is alot of fun and with it being made by step 2 we all know it will last a long time
