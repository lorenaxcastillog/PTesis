 We received these as a gift, and have only just realized that they are by the same company that makes all of our son's favorite toys. He's been playing with them from about 1-2 months. He loves these boxes, especially the red one with the mirror on the end. They have interesting things for him to grab onto and look at, varied textures, and make different sounds that he likes. He'll get his hand into the rings, clutch the boxes to his chest and chew on their corners, but he'll also spend minutes just staring at the red one and cooing happily. We thought he was looking at himself in the mirror when he did that, and sometimes he is--but as often as not he's just admiring the patterning on the side. Great toys for a small infant
