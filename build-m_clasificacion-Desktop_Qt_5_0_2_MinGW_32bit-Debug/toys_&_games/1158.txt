 I only purchased this item due to the 4.99 price. I must admit when I opened the box I wanted to stuff it back in and say forget it, but that could have been due to the other 25 things I had already put together and was just tired. 15 minutes later my 11 year old son had it complete and my daughters 6 & 10 were having a blast. I figured I would have to go out and buy them a couple of the mermaidia dolls to go with but that wasn't true. Any barbie works great. It came with a table, 2 chairs, one character, mirror, sink, comb, hammock, a flying flower, and a slide. The house itself is about 2 foot tall
