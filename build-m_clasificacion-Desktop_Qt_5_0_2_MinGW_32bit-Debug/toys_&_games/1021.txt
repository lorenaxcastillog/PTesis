 We purchased this puzzle for our son when he was 1 year old. Now, one year later, he still enjoys playing with it. This is such a wonderful starter puzzle because it teaches little ones that pieces can only fit one way. This seems so basic, but it lets them have early success, which builds confidence for doing more advanced puzzles later. Also, the chunky wood pieces are easy for small hands to recognize, remove, grasp, and manipulate. This puzzle is not challenging for our son anymore, but he really likes talking about all the vehicles, the sounds they make, etc. Like all Melissa & Doug toys, this puzzle is very well-made. One bonus about this company is if you lose or break a piece, they'll replace it, usually with no additional charge. That's quality service!
