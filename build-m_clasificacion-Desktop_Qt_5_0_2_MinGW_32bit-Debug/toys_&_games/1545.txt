 This item is very cheaply made. Some parts do not stay together, etc. I am happy with the price I paid for it through Amazon---thankfully I didn't pay what it was selling for in stores! But did notice right after Christmas it was on clearance for approximately 70% off. That alone lets you know it is not of the best quality. My daughter tried to enjoy this toy, but with pieces falling off she just got fed up. It has been the least played with of her toys. She owns numerous Little Mommy products and really enjoys the dolls. The retail prices of of the Toddler Doll and Activity Center certainly led me to believe they would have been of better quality
