 My 5 year old daughter got this guitar for Christmas. She couldn't wait to get the guitar out of the box and start playing it like her daddy does. She just rocks out on it. She is constantly asking her daddy to play guitar with her. They go into music room and rock out together. The guitar is just a toy, but to a 5 year old whose daddy plays guitar she just loves it anyway. My 3 year old wants one now so guess I have to go out and get her one for her birthday now. I have to agree that the mircophone is poor quality. It will not stay on my daughter's head for anything. She actually gets it to stay but not the correct way. She tells me that the Wiggles have one of these and sing into it.
