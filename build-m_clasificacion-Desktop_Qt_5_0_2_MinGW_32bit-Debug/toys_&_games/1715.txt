 I ordered this raft late in the summer hoping we would get more use out of it. My one year old loves the water and gets really hard to hold after a while, she never wants to get out. Although she tried to climb out of this raft, unsuccefully, she seemed to enjoy it. She was able to splash in the water and kick her feet. We could still play motor boat and twirl her around. I gave it 4 stars because you still have to blow it up and deflate it and I do not know how long it would last if used heavily
