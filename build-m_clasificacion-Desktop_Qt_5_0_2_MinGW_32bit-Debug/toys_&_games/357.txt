 The Maestro, the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse. Apocalypse being the kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series. Maestro Hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst. His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head. He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you. Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series. Talk about alpha and omega
