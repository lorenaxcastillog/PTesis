 We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years. After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked. And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped. Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel. The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve. The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them. Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling. I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly.
