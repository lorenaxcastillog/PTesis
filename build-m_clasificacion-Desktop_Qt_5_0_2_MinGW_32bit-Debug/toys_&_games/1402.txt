 I bought several of these for use at our church. They are an excellent alternative to a standard globe. I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on regular globes, and we don't have a lot of room to store them. These globes can be deflated and easily stored when they're not in use. Also, if you are using them in a classroom, and you want a child to identify a country on the globe, you can simple throw it to them. Believe it or not, we didn't have any trouble with the kids getting rambunctious with it, but it did keep their interest
