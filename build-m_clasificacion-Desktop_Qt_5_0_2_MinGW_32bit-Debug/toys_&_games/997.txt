 I agree with many of the other reviewers that this bike tips over very easily. My son does know how to pedal a bike, and yet this tips without any warning. He has gotten caught underneath the bike, and had the handlebars turn so that he needed help to get the bike off of him so he could get up. The only positive aspects are that we store ours outside and it has held up well, also, my son was able to reach the pedals before he turned 2 (he is a lttle under the 50% for height) so he was able to learn to pedal on this bike. As a side note, the 2 most positive reviews for this bike are over 18 months old, I think it is quite possible they have a different model than what is currently available
