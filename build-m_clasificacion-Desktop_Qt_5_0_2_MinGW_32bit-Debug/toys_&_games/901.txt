 This game asks questions about the Marvel Universe, mostly the recent trend in movies, but also some questions about the actual comic books and popular characters in various franchises. The questions are relatively easy, but if you're playing with other people, this is part of the fun, as you race to see who can shout out the answer first. The DVD game modes are diverse and interesting, including clips, comic book covers, and other games based on either pictures or words (fill-in-the blank, scramble, etc.) If you enjoy Scene It! (basically Trivial Pursuit with a DVD), then you'll like this game as well, as it is similar to other games in the franchise
