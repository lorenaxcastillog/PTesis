 Thought the price + free shipping was one of those "too good to be true" deals, but went against my better judgement and ordered it anyways. Glad I did. A sturdy table and nice set of trains/tracks, but you can tell the original Thomas/Brio tracks/pieces are better quality (for 4 times the price). There were quite a few scratches on the wood pieces and one of the glued on pieces for the storage box was in the wrong place so I had to pry it off and reglue it in order for the "walls" to fit in place. Also another piece of the table had a glued on piece that fell off so I had to re-glue that one too. Under the Product Features, it says "Rolling storage trundle under table". There are no wheels on the storage box. The playboards have 2 holes (2 inches in diameter). I suppose it's to make it easier to pull the boards up, but I covered them up because the edge of the risers kept falling in the holes. All in all, a good value and my 2 year old loves it...which trumps everything I said above.
