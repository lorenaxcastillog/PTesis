 Have you ever seen the movie Se7en? If you have, then you have seen Humpty Dumpty. While Humpty was origionally an egg, here he's more like an obese (overly) man who, instead of getting cracked was more like disemboweled. This is where simplicity meets detail and works, better than lets say 'Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater'...It's simple in that there are not a lot of small pieces and such...it's just a big blob of plastic, but it's detailed in that there is a lot going on here. The detail is, for lack of a better word, disgusting, but then again, so is the thought of a broken egg (yolk is messy)...So, as I've mentioned before, these are less 'toys' and more shelf space and that's how we like them...on the shelf in their plastic and meant to be owed at because McFarlane is a genious
