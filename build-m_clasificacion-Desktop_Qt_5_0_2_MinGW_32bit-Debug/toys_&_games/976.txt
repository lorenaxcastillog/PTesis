 My son received the Read With Me DVD System and all the DVDs as an early Christmas present from his uncle. After a week this DVD and the Dr. Seuess one are his two favorites. This DVD has a charming story about Curious George visiting a chocolate factory. It has a fun game where kids can make their own chocolate candy and design a machine. It also teaches new vocabulary. One part of the story teaches the children what "curious" means so they understand why George has his name. I like that my son is learning new words, listening to an entertaining story, and enjoying himself at the same time. I would recommend this DVD to be purchased if someone is wondering which ones in the series to buy. It is much better than some of the others.
