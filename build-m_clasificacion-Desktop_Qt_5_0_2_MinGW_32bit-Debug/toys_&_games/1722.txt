 Like many others, my 3 year old daughter received this for Christmas. She received the castle that was packaged w/3 bonus ponies. The castle feels solid and is easy for her to open & close. She likes the option of using the wand to open the castle or pushing the button above the doors instead. She enjoys putting her ponies or other toys in it. I also like that she can close up many of her ponies in it for the evening and everything is confined into one little space. She can even carry it from one room to another that way. The problems: there really isn't room to play IN the castle with the few small accessories it comes with, some of the accessories are very small, the magnet on the dance floor is a little difficult to manuever. None of these issues bother my daughter, though. She loves the castle, which makes it money well spent
