 My husband and I have ignored many poor reviews in choosing toys for our 18-month old and have often been pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the Peg Perego Thomas Ride-On train. He is exceptionally tall and strong for his age, yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the button required to keep the train moving, much less hold it down for any length of time. So the operation of the train requires an adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the experience. My son enjoys pushing the train along the track more than riding it. However, the train is flimsy and easily comes off the track, so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again frustrated and annoyed. All this and then you need to get out the screwdriver to charge the battery every time you "play" with it. Don't buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are. It's a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major Thomas-lovers will probably not enjoy.
