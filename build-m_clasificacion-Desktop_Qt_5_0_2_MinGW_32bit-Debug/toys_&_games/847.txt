 This was the main thing my daughter wanted for xmas. Three months later I finally gathered everything up in a grocery bag and took it back to the store because it had just sat collecting dust. Main reason being we couldn't get it open. It took 2 days to set the date. Then I figured since I could do that it would be ok to close it until we could work with it some more. We tried and tried to use the password but no luck. Honestly I think they need to take the thing off the market. It's a nice concept. I ended up getting her the barbie dairy instead. Much less stress and much cheaper. I know there are plenty of people out there that agree with me I only wish I would have listened to you before I bought it.
