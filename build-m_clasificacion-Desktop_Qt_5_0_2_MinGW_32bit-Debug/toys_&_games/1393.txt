 We purchased this bed with the intention of using it for vacations, sleepovers etc. However, we soon came to realize that setting this bed up is no easy feat. It comes in four seperate inflatable pieces. You need to first assemble the footboard to the headboard which is done by fitting plastic pieces into each other and turning them. The only problem is they keep falling out. The battery operated ( 4 D cell batteries) pump that is included is painstakingly slow. Even with an electric pump which we used, there are many different air chambers that need to be filled and it is quite time consuming. This bed can not be set up in minutes as they claim and as far as taking it apart, to fit it back in the storage bag you need to completley deflate it. I would not recommend this bed to somebody looking for a travel bed. We ended up returning it
