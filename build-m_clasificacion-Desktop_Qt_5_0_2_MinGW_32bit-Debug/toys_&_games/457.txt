 I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly. This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic "tow truck". Melissa and Doug have made two other puzzles similar to this, a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle, with the same concept. This one, however, might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks. One of our pieces (on the fishing version of this puzzle) did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy!
