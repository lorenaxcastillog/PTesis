 I have a 1 year old girl and a 2 year old boy and both of them love this toy! My youngest loves the sounds that it makes and my oldest loves changing the tiles over to reveal a new piece of the puzzle. They don't understand how to make a new picture (by flipping the tiles until you get a matching piece of the puzzle. there are 3 puzzles) but that will come in time. It keeps them busy in the car which is great, and its educational because its a puzzle, but it doesn't have lots of pieces that would get lost. I think that it is totally worth the money and a great itea!
