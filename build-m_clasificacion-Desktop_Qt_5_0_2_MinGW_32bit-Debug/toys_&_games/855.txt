 I bought this book as a sanity-saver to take on my recent 4-hour plane ride with my then 19 month old son. It served its purpose and then some. He still loves this book, over a month later. I was surprised to read other comments about losing the pieces and having to play "supervised" with this book, as I have had no problem with this at all. Sometimes we read the book together, and sometimes he "reads" it himself. He hasn't lost a piece, yet and this book has been on many excursions with us, including the one mentioned above, where we took it across the country. (including connecting flights) My only complaint is that the pictures aren't so great. In fact, it is very difficult to discern the animal in the "M" picture for monkey... even for me. But they're not all bad. It was still a great choice for us
