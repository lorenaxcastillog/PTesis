 My soon to be 2 year old son is obsessed with shapes and had outgrown the basic shape puzzle (the large knob puzzle by melissa and doug) and I was looking for a puzzle that went beyond that but was not too difficult. I was thrilled to find this! It looks and feels great too. My son really enjoys it and I think it is conceptually very well put together. Not only are the puzzles well within his reach but he also enjoys free play with the shapes. He recently discovered that 2 triangles can make a square and two rectangles can make a square too :) That was only possible because the shapes are thoughtfully proportioned as such. I do agree with the other viewer who said that this puzzle is not for a 5 year old. My son is not yet 2 and he can do them. If it wasn't for the sharp edges of the shapes I would say its for 18+ months - 3 years
