 I read some of the other reviews about htis item and was nervous about getting it put together. Despite what I read, it was very simple. I did it all by myself and it was ready to play with in just 2 hours (That's counting putting on all of the decals). If you just set up your "work area" before you get started, it's simple. The decals weren't hard to get on with it being set up. I think this is a great toy to have. My daughter is 4 nd a half and she absolutely loves it. I would recomend this toy to everyone with kids. I am very pleased with my purchase and know this toy is well worth the $199 I spent. I ordered it directly from Step 2 and they had it delivered to me on Christmas Eve.....just in the nick of time!!
