 When I got Kerplunk home and opened the box, I was dumbfounded. The game was this little plastic thing made from cheap materials. As a kid, we had Kerplunk and it was much taller and wider. It was made of a heavier plastic, too. You could be extra careful when you removed the straws because the whole thing was solid and wouldn't budge. The new one is so little, you have to hold it with one hand while you pull the straw, making it difficult to move carefully. I think this is the same type of problem parents are having with retro games. The toy manufacturers know the parent will say, "I had this game when I was a kid, so I'll buy it for my kid!" Unfortunately, the new versions are smaller, cheaper and more fragile. If the original version of a game is what is desired, then a parent will have to buy an old game from Ebay. This is actually a cool game, just not the new version
