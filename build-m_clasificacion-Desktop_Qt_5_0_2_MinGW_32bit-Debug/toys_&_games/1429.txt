 My daughter loves this swing. We bought it ot put on the variety climber with swing set extension. She'd love to swing all afternoon if she could. I do have to agree with the other reviewers, the swing does tend to swing at a diagnol, but it happens when the child in the seat isn't centered in the seat if they are leaning to one side or the other. You can only do small adjustments on the swing because it only comes with rope. No extra chain etc. really will fix the diagnol swing, but you can barely tell it swings that way. It has not taken away from the fun value and Grace doesn't seem to care one bit. It is safe with a buckle and easy to get in and out of once you do it a couple of times. I would buy this swing again, diagnol swinging and all.
