 These are, without a doubt, the BEST bathtub crayons available (and we've tried all brands!) The pigment is vibrant, and they even color under water. It doesn't matter if they get wet...they still work (unlike other bathtub crayons). These 'click' up to expose fresh crayon, and do NOT dissolve in water. Clean up is easy with the provided duck sponge (and when my husband is in charge of bathtime, and forgets to clean the tub, I can testify that they do, indeed, wash off without staining the tub!) I can't recommend these crayons enough to other parents...our toddler loves them and has become quite the bathtime artist. A great gift for friends too
