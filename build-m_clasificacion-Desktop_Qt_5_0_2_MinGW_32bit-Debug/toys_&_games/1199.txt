 Booooo. Not fun, don't waste your money on this one. Talk about disappointment. I have searched for cool tub toys for so long and thought for sure I had a winner. Nope! 1)The little clown head doesn't stay on. 2)the beach ball that you squeeze to make the water run down the slide, simply doesn't provide enough umph to get the water really going 3) the slide keeps falling off 4) the suction cups don't hold really well. I took the slide off and now we just pour water into the cup at the top and call it a day
