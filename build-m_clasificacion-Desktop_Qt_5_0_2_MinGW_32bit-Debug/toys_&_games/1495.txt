 Ok, this set is a little on the small side. Despite this, there are a good number of bricks in this set - can't remember the actual number right now. The Batman sets are a little on the pricey side; but since this is the smallest of them, it's the most affordable. You get two minifigs, Batman and Catwoman- that alone is reason enough for fans to pick this set up. Catwoman's motorcycle is great, but you can't rebuild it into very many other things. Batman's dragster - I don't like it on it's own - but it's built of enough parts that there is huge potential for making your own creations. Plus you get some bricks with Bat-symbols on them. This set also includes a good number of tiny less-common bricks that a MOCer would always find useful. A must have for Batman LEGO users
