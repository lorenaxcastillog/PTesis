 We bought this toy for my little neice for Christmas - what a let down! The toy looks easy enough to put together on both the instruction sheet and the photo on the box but in reality this thing is very confusing and nearly impossible! The slots to insert the sticker back and the clear plastic are so tiny - we used tweezers and still could barely do it! Once you think you've figured out how to get the paper and stickers and plastic together, you've used half of each roll and there are not additional rolls included, nor can you buy them separately! There is an internal piece that just doesn't fit once the stickers were in place - this toy is ridiculous. It is such a cute idea, but three adults spent over an hour trying to put it together and we finally gave up. Such a disappointment to a litle girl on Christmas morning!!!
