 It can be almost impossible to turn at times. Instead of moving one to the right, you have to go three to the left, or fiddle with it so it lines up properly. You can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move the way you want it to. I was hoping it'd be better cause it's really cool that it fits in your pocket. It's just too hard to turn. I ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way. And I cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing. I really like this product (I'm buying another one), I just wish it wasn't so stiff. Maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it, you can finish a rubik's cube in 5 minutes, max, so I don't see the need to prevent it from turning. Apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter
