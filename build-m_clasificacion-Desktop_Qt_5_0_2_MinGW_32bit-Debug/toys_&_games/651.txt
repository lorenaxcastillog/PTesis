 Our little girl absolutely loves puzzles, and this one presented a real challenge. The pieces are somewhat irregular, left from right, which allows for growth in her problem-solving abilities. I bought this when she was 22 months, and she has been able to master it quickly. Not only do the pegged pieces help define fine motor skills, but the numbers, colors, and left/right make this a multi-dimensional learning tool. She's 24 months now, and has most colors down as well as learning to count. The colors were really helpful, because being the neurotic parent, I was beginning to wonder if she had some colorblindness because she wasn't recognizing colors at first. But silly me, I forgot she was a toddler. So much for my fears of why she isn't solving quadratic equations.
