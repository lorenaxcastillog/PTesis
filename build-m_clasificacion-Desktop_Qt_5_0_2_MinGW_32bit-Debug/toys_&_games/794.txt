 This has got to be one of the best things i ever bought my kids!!!!!!!!!!! Even the adults loved it and we have found that you dont only have to use the paper we even put 4x4 household floor tiles on it making sure they were centered and the kids painted them not only with the paint that came with the thing but with the paint you find in any craft store. then we sprayed them with clear spray paint and you can use them for coasters or as i am gonna do use them for a back splash made by my kids. This is a MUST BUY TOY FOR ALL AGES my 4 year old grandson was even able to use this with no problem, and they have ran the thing for many hours and it is still using the same batteries that it came with.
