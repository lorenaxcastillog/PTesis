 MY SON RECEIVED THIS LAST CHRISTMAS WHEN HE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD. WE KEEP IT IN HIS CRIB AND TILL THIS DAY WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, INSTEAD OF CRYING FOR A BOTTLE OR JUST FOR US TO COME GET HIM HE PLAYS WITH THIS TOY! IT IS A BIG LAUGH IN OUR FAMILY BECAUSE AT LEAST 4 NIGHTS A WEEK WE HEAR HIM PLAYING "HIS PIANO" AS WE CALL IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!! HE ENTERTAINS HIMSELF TILL HE GOES BACK TO SLEEP- WHAT A RELIEF FOR US! MY BROTHERS 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER STILL WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO I SUGGESTED HE RUN OUT AND GET THIS TOY! I LIKE PLAYING WITH IT ALSO, AND THE COLOR AND LIGHTS ARE VEYR NICE. IT IS NOT LOUD AND ANNOYING LIKE SOME TOYS. IT IS ALSO PRETTY DURABLE. 1 YEAR AND STILL GOING STRONG
