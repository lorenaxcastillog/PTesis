 Unfortunately you CANNOT use mini cds instead of the PVDs. It may burn the disk, but if you put the mini disc into the video now player, the machine DOES NOT recognize it, and you will get an error message. According to Hasbro customer service, you can't purchase the PVDs separately anywhere, so if you want more PVDs, you will have to buy more of these kits. You can cut down regular Cds as another reviewer suggested. However, this is a tedious and difficult process. Overall, this is a good idea, but you have to wonder what Hasbro was thinking by not making these blank discs available for sale individually..
