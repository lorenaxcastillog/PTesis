 I bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister. The skates are good overall. They are easy enough to put on and take off. The padding inside is nice. The only drawback I can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll. I am not sure if I just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates. I will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting.
