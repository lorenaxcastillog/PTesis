 This toy is not safe for other children, the batteries keep running out every time i play for 20 minutes how rude. That's why i don't play my leadpay no more cause mommy saids i'm to busy honey i can't go out and buy some sorry. Where ever I touch the leapad said something wrong and wrost of all I get something right it saids its wrong and once you play for like 5 days it bores you already.... stop selling this!!!!!!!! but its kind of fun once you learn something you never knew and it talk so this is not to boring. This should be in schools why no
