 My 6 year old son got this as a gift for Christmas and immediately wanted to make the "food". All the recipes for the gummies are basically the same, you just change the flavor to suit your taste. We never did find a flavor or combination flavor that he liked, and ended up throwing out all of the treats he made. The drinks were equally as bad tasting. There were no directions as to how to set up your "lab", just a lot of connector pieces that didn't seem to fit everywhere you wanted them to. As other reviewers stated, you need to have an adult there to help with the mixing. He grew bored with the kit, put it away, and has not asked to play with it again.
