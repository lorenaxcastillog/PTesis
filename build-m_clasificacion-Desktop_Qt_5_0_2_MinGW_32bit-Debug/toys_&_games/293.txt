 Our daughter got the pull and spin caterpillar for christmas (she was 9months at the time). At the time she wasn't able to pull it but loved to chase the caterpillar as it was being pulled. Now at 12 months she is able to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the back of the caterpillar. The toy it self has a very cute face and when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down. The only problem with the caterpillar is the pull string. It is very small and thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to pull it. Overall a wonderful toy, not only for the balls that come with it but for anything else that your little puts on it
