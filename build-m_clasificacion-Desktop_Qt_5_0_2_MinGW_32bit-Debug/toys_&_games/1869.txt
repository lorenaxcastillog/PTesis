 When i opened this present,i was like "oh great, a useless present that i will never wnat to play with" well, i opened it up, read the simple directions, and began making music within the next couple minutes. you can plug headphones right into it or even plug it into your standard amplifier. I think that if you just like playing with music toys, then get this. If your actually serious about thinking of playing the drums or whatever, i think you would be happy with this. even though there are only about 6 drum sounds, you can actually make some serouis music with this thing. instead of buying a $500 electonic drum set, just get these!!! Also, since it is just classified as a toy, you would think that when you wave the stick, a sound would come out 10 seconds later or something - well you wrong! this is very very accurate, and the sound is heard as soon as you wave the stick i just think everyone should no that these drumsticks are amazing, and i cant stop playing with them now, stop reading this, scroll up, and click "Add to Cart
