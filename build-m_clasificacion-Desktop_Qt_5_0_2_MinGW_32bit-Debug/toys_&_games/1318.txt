 This Star Wars game is the best plug and play game of its kind. You get to choose amongst five games. Included are two Jedi themed games, two starfighter themed games, and one in which you ride a Boga across the planet of Utapau. My personal favorites were the Coruscant Attack and the Utapau Chase. In the CA, I am Obi-Wan in a Jedi starfighter as I shoot down droid ships while trying to bring down battleships. Once you learn how to control the ship, it is all down-hill from there. In the UC, I am again Obi Wan as I ride a Boga shooting down or slamming enemy Bogas into the wall. The final showdown involves a duel with General Grievous' speeder. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good video game.
