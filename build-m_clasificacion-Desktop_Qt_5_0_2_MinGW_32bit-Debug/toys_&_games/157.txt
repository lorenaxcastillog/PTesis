 I'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones!! Ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. It wasn't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort. My son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly. He loved to see the lights and the little puppy "dance" when he "sang" into the microphone. I continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then I finally put it away. I wish I had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer. My son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after Christmas last year, just before this piano broke. I highly recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech. We have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have owned have broken on us. Garbage!
