 I wanted a floor mat for my child because some of her toys are designed to be hung from the bars, but I didn't want to pay the $60+ price of many mats. We paid ~$25 for this one. She liked to play with the toys provided; however, these toys hang from the bars by velcro strips. There are no rings on the bars with which to hang other toys. We were able to hang other toys on the bars and secure them in place with velcro straps inserted through the ring of the toy and wrapped around the bar. I have not had the assembly problems referred to in other reviews
