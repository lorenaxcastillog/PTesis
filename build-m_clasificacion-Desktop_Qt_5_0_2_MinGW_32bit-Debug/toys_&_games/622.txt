 We bought this for our son who will turn 2 this month. He loves to cook and was always in my pans. He now has his own kithchen and loves all the sounds and different compartments. He is a very active boy and loves to climb and try to tear things up. I love step 2 because it is very durable and this kithchen is a great addition to our toys. Plus I love the neutral colors considering this was for a boy!! Highly recommend and was not that difficult to put together. Just do the stickers first and have 14 batteries ready!!
