 My 4 1/2 year old son got this for his 3rd birthday and it is still going strong! Even after his uncle put a tow hitch on it and he tows any thing he can, including his sister's Barbie Jeep. He "4x4"'s, slams into things and is just generally very hard on it! Compared to his sister's jeep & cousin's ride on toys, the turning radius is the best I have seen, the two front seats are quite roomy and the battery holds better than I expected. It rides on pavement, gravel and grass with ease and with a running start can make it up some decent grassy hills. It is well worth the extra money. The only con I could find is that it isn't big enough for me to drive!
