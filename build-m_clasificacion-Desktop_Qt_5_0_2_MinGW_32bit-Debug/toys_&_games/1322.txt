 My two year old daughter has been collecting a variety of Weebels Toys since her first birthday and she loves them all, but the Weebalot Castle is, by far, her favorite play set. The most entertaining featuring is obviously the revolving moat, and my daughter delights in dropping her Weebles into the moat through the secret passageway. The Weebalot castle is very well made. Our only complaint is that the draw bridge pops off very easily, but this doesn't bother my daughter as much as it bothers me. Another reviewer complained that the music does not play long enough... the music plays for a very short time, but my daughter loves activating the musical features again and again, so this is not a problem for us. Before my daughter received the castle, her favorite toy was the Weebly Wobbly Tree House. She still plays with both sets often, frequently along side one another, but when she chooses only one set it is usally the castle! We have been giving this as a first birthday gift to friends and cousins and it is always a big hit
