 My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother. He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets. Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart. NOTE: he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys. But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play. After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it. We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale. I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money. Save yourself the pain and frustration and buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff
