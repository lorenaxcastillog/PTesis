 The dumper in the back is already full. My son can't put dirt or sand in the back and dump it out. It's already filled with plastic "dirt" with another layer of plastic "dirt" underneath that becomes visible when the top layer is "dumped." But even this dumpable top layer is attached to the toy...so nothing gets dumped! We got a tiny screwdriver and released a screw under the dumper (took forever), and the fake dirt popped out. Now my son is happy his Muck is "fixed". He asked us to fix the bucket, which is not curved enough to scoop any sand or dirt because there's a magnet inside. But there's no screw. So he can only use the little log it came with. As clever as the magnet is, it's only fun for a day. As is the trend, this toy is only capable of playing in a closed system. It doesn't fit into my son's life. Can't they just make me a Muck? Why do they have to gunk up the works
