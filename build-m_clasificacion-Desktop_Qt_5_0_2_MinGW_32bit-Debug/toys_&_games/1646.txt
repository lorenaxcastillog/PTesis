 Hi, the names Tom, i'm 12 years old and I know a thing or two about kids these days being one my self, my parents bought this toy for me last christmas and it was terrible, it took 3 days to put up and when it got put up every time you tried to use it it broke so it took another hour to set backup. It's almost impossible get the orange tubes in the right place and when you get it in the right place they bend back out, so when you drop a ball it either misses the thing completley or it hits the rim and bounces out. I highly do not reccomend this toy. *************** MY toy rating in the top 100:98 ***************
