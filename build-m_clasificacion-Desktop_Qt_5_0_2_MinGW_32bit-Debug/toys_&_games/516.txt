 The first time I played this game was with my co-workers at Happy Hour and then again with my family members on our summer vacation at the beach house. Although we were already close and "thought" we knew a lot about each other-this game only made us closer. I don't remember laughing as hard as I did once secrets started to become revealed. The next morning at breakfast, no one could even make eye contact without laughing! This game is perfect to play with a group of friends or family and will keep you laughing all the way thru! It would make a perfect holiday gift-I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are up for some laughs!
