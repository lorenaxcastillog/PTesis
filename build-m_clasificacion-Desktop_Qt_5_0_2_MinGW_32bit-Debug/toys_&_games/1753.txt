 We received this as a gift for our son. The toys that came in it are his favorites, hands down. When he first started teething (at 4 months) he chewed on the little alligator and pelican non-stop. Now (at 9 months) he loves the stacking cups and rattling balls. Wherever he goes he has a ball in each hand. We offer him toys with lots of bells and whistles, but he only wants these simple, colorful ones. Definitely one of the best gifts we received. Unlike the other reviewer, I have not had any trouble with mold or a plastic smell
