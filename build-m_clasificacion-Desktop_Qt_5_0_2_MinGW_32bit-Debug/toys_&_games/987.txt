 My 3 year old received this toy for Christmas. She enjoys putting the puzzles together very much. However, she has trouble getting them apart - the wooden pieces do not come apart very easily. We already have 4 or 5 pieces that have broken - a layer of the wood has come off, either off the picture part or the back of the piece. I was disappointed when a piece broke after we only had the puzzles a few days! The wood is very thin. The shapes on the back are great for sorting the pieces, but the compartments that hold the pieces aren't big enough. If the pieces don't go in "just so" - the lid won't close. The puzzles are nice, but I would not purchase this toy again due to the quality
