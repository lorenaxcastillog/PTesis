 I showed my 20 mo. old daughter this at Wal-Mart and she's adored it ever since. It worried me that she forcefully bent back the characters all the time, but 2 months later and they're still going strong. This piano has 8 songs, one by each character. Each bit is 10 seconds long approx. "Wigglegroove" "Rolling Down the SandHills" "Music w/ Murray" "Where's Jeff?" "Vegetable Soup" "All I need is Food" "Play your Guitar w. Murray" and "Calling All Cows". That's more than enough to entertain a child that age. She can follow some of what they're singing like "Clap your hands and spin around". Also it's nice that there are two volume levels so as not to vex harried parents. The worst thing that happened is the toy got a liitle wet underneath and some of the piano keys won't work anymore...she hardly pays with them anyway and will pull the guys and jump along to the recorded songs. For ages 1-3 this toy is fun, if your kid loves the Wiggles like mine does.
