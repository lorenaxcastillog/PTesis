 This parachute is a lot of fun! Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it, but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down. He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction. This one is bigger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing, but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home. If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around. But if you have only 3 people to play with, while it still works, it's more fun with more people. But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be! Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids
