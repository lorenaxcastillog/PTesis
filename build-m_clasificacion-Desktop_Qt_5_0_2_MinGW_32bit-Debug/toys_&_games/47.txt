 Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle. Now on to the reality... I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier. But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk. You get what you pay for. Stephen John Beccia Author of The Treelanders
