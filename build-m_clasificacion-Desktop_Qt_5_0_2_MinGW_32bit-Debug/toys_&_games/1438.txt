 I was so excited to see that this was on sale, especially after seeing the picture of the baby inside the toy under the customer photos. When it arrived, I was very disappointed. The picture is clearly of the larger version of this, and it doesn't tell you that. This is actually quite small. When I ordered, there were no dimensions listed in the description, I'm not sure if they changed it. It's only about a 15 inches tall and wide. Also, the toy isn't really that great. The bead thing is neat, but the sliding puzzles on the sides are pretty pointless as you can only slide them about an inch. The music drum thing is attached to a very short cord, so it's hard to use it on the xylophone. It is relatively durable though, made of nice wood, so it will probably last. But then again, my son barely plays with it, so he wont have a chance to break it anyway.
