 The reason I'm so THRILLED with this sturdy, wooden set from LIttle Tikes (table and chairs) is that it's smaller than most kids furniture. I was all set to pay big bucks for Pottery Barn Kids stuff, but my (very tall) two year old wasn't big enough for them! He loves doing projects and play doh etc. so we wanted to get him a table. I spied this set behind a bunch of stuff at our local toy store and when he sat on it, VOILA!! It was perfect. It is heavy and sturdy (good for boys) and the natural wood looks great in our home. I also realized that although I lusted after the painted PBK stuff, it will chip and stains will show much quicker than this natural wood. We are VERY pleased with it
