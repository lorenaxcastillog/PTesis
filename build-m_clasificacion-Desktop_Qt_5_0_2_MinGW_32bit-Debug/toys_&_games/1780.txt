 There isn't much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. But I will. This game is labeled for ages 7+. I'll tell you, though, my boys were absolute UNO ADDICTS when they were 4. It's really easy to learn, so they caught on very quickly. For about 6 months, they played this game with my husband every day as soon as they got up in the morning and the minute he got home from work each day. We have taken a deck with us everywhere we've gone incase we've needed something to do to pass time. We would never be without this game. Playing with the little kids, we never keep score. We just play that whoever goes out wins. Works for us.
