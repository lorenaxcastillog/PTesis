 If you have to put the tracks on the carpet or even an area rug I'd definitely get the "sure tracks" for the hill, we had problems with the trains getting stuck either before or after. However, if you have a train table, or any hard surface it's not a neccessity. The battery-powered train is nice though not super fast by any means. Also, the switch on top is hard for my son 2 1/2 to turn off, front is forward, middle is off and back is backwards, kind of tough to get it in the middle to the off so when I tell him to go turn his engine off if he's going to leave the room, I have to help him or do it myself. Also invest in some rechargable AAA batteries as they only last about a day or two if they run a lot. This mountain adventure set definitely has the "cute" factor going. Love the mountain/tunnel and bears with the cave. All pieces seem high quality, even the plastic mountain and bridge.
