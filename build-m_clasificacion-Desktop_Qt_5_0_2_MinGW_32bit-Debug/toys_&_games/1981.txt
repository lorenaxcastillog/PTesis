 This is the first Kid K'Nex toy that we bought for our 3 1/2-year-old boy and he loved it. The parts are big enough for the preschooler's hands and very easy to snap together. First he made many different designs by himself and was very proud of it. After a month, he started trying the designs in the design booklet. I was surprised to see that he was able to duplicate the models, though I prefer that he makes his own designs which he still does. I like the flexible parts and wish there were more than 2. Overall, I'm very happy with this toy
