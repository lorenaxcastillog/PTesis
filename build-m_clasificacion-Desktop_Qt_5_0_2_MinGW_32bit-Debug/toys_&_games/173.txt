 BUYER BEWARE!!!! I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas. On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt. I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd. I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December. The billing however has yet to be straighted out. My credit card has yet to be credited, I do not have the product, and no one returns calls or emails. BUYER BEWARE!!!
