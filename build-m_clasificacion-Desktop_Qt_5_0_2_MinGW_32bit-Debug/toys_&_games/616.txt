 Overall this is a nice toy. My daughter loves animals and if your child does this would be one they would enjoy playing with over and over again. It comes with everything you need to care for the puppy. The puppy is soft and very huggable. The only thing I would suggest is that it should come with a small bag to keep all the pieces in. My daughter ends up throwing all the pieces into the carrier with the dog in it and they jiggle and spill out sometimes when it's being carried around. It would also help to avoid losing those small pieces. Other than that, we love it
