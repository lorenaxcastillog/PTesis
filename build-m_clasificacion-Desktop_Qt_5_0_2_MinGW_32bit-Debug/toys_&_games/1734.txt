 I got this for my 9 month old who has mastered basic crawling. She loves to have her "secret" hideaway and I love that I can still see her. She'll pull toys or snacks into the middle of the tunnel and play. We have fun as I chase her through the house and she always makes the tunnel part of the route. She just learned that if she faces towards the fabric, she can crawl and use it like a hamster ball. Sometimes when she crawls through, I start to move it side-to-side for a challenge. She really enjoys compensating for the movement.
