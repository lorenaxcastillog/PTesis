 I agree that the Denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny was born in Taiwan. Chinese people don't look any one way and to expect them to is racist, like saying they all look alike. The hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good . The dress looks redder when you display her out of the box.Fabric quality is better than average for Mattel. Her hair is also much nicer and has more style than Mattel had been giving us. I think this doll bodes well for better things to come in this doll series.
