 I love this doll and so does my 2 year old and my 5 year old. I couldn't get the 2nd one before Christmas and just got the Hispanic version, which I think it cuter (at least on the computer) than the Blonde Caucasion baby. My daughters only speak spanish from Dora the Explorer, but this may help them - and my 2 year old doesn't care which language she is speaking, she seems to know what she wants! Anyway - I would suggest this doll for anyone! I EVEN LIKE PLAYING WITH HER!! LOL :-) I do agree with the not enough diapers and too much food. Right now we are just "Pretending" that she is eating, so we don't waste the diapers. I'll give her an A++ her hair is thin, but her head is dark, so you can't tell. Not sure what the blonde hair will be like
