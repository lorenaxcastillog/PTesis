 I like the simon hand held because you start following the pattern to a stopping point when you lose. Then you are frusterated and are determined to do it again. Even if you beat Simon it is still calling you to play again. It is very addicting hand held. I go to O.T. and my theripist introduced me to Simon and I started playing it and I spent 30 minutes trying to beat Simon. I did beat him once and I beat him again right when I was about to leave. I still can't beat it again. My theripist tryed to do it and wasn't even close. She spent 10 minutes figuring it out. She didn't get after 10 minutes and gave up. So if you decide to make more Simon hand helds, for your sake in money you might want to make it more difficult so it will be even more addicting.
