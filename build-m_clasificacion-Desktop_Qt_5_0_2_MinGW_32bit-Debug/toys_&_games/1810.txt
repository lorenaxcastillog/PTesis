 I had previously purchased the standard blue Doodle Pro for my 3 year old, and he loved it - a great toy. So when my 1 1/2 year old twins started showing an interest in drawing, I purchased one of these Little People boards for each of them. Much to my disappointment, the tip on the end of the pen was so short that its impossible to draw unless the pen is straight up and down. The soccer ball slide eraser is so tight that they can hardly move it. The only good thing is the magnets are nice and big and easy to use. I have to say that all in all, this is taking the product downhill - stick with the standard Doodle Pro, you'll be much happier
