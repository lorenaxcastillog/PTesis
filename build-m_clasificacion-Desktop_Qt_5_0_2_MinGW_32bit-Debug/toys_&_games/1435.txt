 Ever since I first saw Luke power up his first lightsaber in Episode IV, I knew I wanted one of my very own. This replica is the closest I'll ever come, and I have to say, it's well worth my money. My brother, sister and I each have one, and we're all very pleased with them. The craftmanship is remarkable on these things! They are all made of metal with some plastic and rubber and are of VERY high quality. This Anakin Skywalker replica feels very solid in my hand--it's about the same weight as Mace Windu's and slightly lighter than the single Darth Maul blade, but Anakin's feels the most comfortable in my hand (not to say the others are at all uncomfortable though). We have been dueling (carefully) with the blades lately, and they have held up surprisingly well to some fairly solid clashes. However, the manual clearly states that these are NOT designed for dueling, nor are they toys. What they are is cool as hell. As a side note, the blue and red sabers shine much more vibrantly than the purple, and all of the blades look much better in low lighting conditions.
