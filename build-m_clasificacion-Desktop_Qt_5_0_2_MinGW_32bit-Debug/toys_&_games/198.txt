 This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack. Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game. However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well. Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work. Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end. I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly. So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success
