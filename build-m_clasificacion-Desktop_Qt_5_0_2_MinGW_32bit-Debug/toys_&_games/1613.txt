 My 4 year old received this from Santa this Christmas. It is great. No batteries too!! He can charge the cars up himself and the race is on. (Just push them back and forth.) He had rec'd a Hot Wheels set from a family member before Christmas. (The box had a large bird on it.) One of the cars starting springs was broken, so only one car could go around the track. The large bird would not fly, it would pop out of it's holder and dive...down. Returned it. We are so happy that Santa brought this one instead of another Hot Wheels set!
