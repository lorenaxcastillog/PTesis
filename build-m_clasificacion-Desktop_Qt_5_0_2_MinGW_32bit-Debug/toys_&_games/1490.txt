 My son absolutely loves cars and that is all he really plays with! He never really slept in his crib, always slept with us but i wanted him to start sleeping in his own bed so i decided to buy this for him when he was 14 months old and he absolutely loved it and he actually wanted to sleep in it. Of course with me at first but he got used to sleeping by hisself and now hes 26 months and still loves it. He always says Vroom Vroom Night Night Car before he goes to sleep. If your son loves cars like mine then he will love this bed. As far as its durability, my friend bought this for her son 4 years ago and it still looks new. It is also made up of durable plastic and should last a long time
