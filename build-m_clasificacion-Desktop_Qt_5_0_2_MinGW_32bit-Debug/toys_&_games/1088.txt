 My husband and I bought this Summertime Playcenter for our daughter's first birthday. I was looking for a standing sand table but wanted sun protection (my daugher has very fair skin like her Mom!). When I found this item I thought it would be great to have the sandbox plus picnic table and sun umbrella all in one - and it is! She and 2 of her friends who are between 2-3 years old spent one entire Saturday afternoon in and out of the sandbox, spreading sand on the table, sitting at the table, and having a ball. My husband also likes the fact that the set is plastic (easy to maintain vs wood) but doesn't look like a loudly colored hunk of plastic in the yard (made to look like wood). Our lid was a bit misshapen from shipping but after leaving it on the sandbox in the sun for a couple of days, it fits tightly. I would recommend removing the umbrella entirely when not in use - it's not too securely set into the table and can blow away even when down ... may be a safety hazard
