 This is the first review I have taken the time to write on Amazon. This toy is as bad as others have said. So much is wrong with the design - but the worst thing is that the reflective panels do not stay in place- I wanted to think that they MUST lock in place somehow. Has Rainbow Art tested this product? I was hoping to read some Amazon reviews of Digidraw to find out if anyone had a remedy for the panels slipping- The remedy is to return the toy. I will quickly say that the reflected image is a blurry shadow - my boy's can do better freehand. Please don't waste your money!
