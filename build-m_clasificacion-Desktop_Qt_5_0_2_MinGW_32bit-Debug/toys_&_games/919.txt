 I was looking for something small, just so my 18 month could cool off with. This is a SMALL pool but for the price its worth it. He doesnt care for the ring toss or the dangling stars. Actually he climbs in and out but it serves its purpose. When its time to mow the grass its not to heavy to empty and hang over a chair until we are ready to use it again. I always ask people, "would you buy it again if something happened to it"?, in this case I would for this season but next year my son will be to big for it
