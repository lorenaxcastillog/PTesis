 My 2 year old daughter plays with the farm nonstop! She loves making all the animal sounds and will make the farmer ride the horse. I LOVE that there is a bed and workbench that make sounds for the farmer. The only thing I wish was different is the merry go round-like part should be easier to turn when full of animals. But other than that, it is SO fun! It has the food and water so the animals can "eat" and the farmer has his cart full of food to go "feed" the animals. This was the toy that started my daugther on the pig snort sound
