 My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day. I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy. The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places. The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit. I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy. I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better. Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality.
