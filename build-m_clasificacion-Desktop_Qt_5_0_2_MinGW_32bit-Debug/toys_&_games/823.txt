 Guillotine is great family game, although some parents may find the premise a bit gruesome for young kids. The characters (from the French Revolution) on the cards are all drawn tastefully, and other than the premise that they are all waiting in line to be beheaded, there is no overt blood or gore invovled. I noticed that the recommended age is 12 and up, but my 8 year old has no trouble understanding the fairly simple rules and strategy to play this game. Another advantage of this game is the short playing time. For two people a game takes about 10-15 mintues, and gets about 5 minutes longer for each additional player
