 If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan. I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable. The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck. Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong
