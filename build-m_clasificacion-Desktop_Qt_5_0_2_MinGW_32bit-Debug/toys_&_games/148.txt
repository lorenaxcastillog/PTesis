 I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option. When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track! The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track. This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market? You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it. I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is. We wanted this toy for portability. Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable
