 My daughter got this for her 1st birthday. We had two other walkers already but this one is much sturdier and more fun. There's a stopper on the back to prevent it from tipping backwards- bigger than the one in the front shown in the picture. There's storage under the seat, a piano, a horn, and plenty of buttons that make noises. It also plays 2 different songs when you push the trees in front and spins the figurines around. The old Disney Princess walker is not as sturdy as this one. Even my 3yr old can ride it without worrying she may break it. Very pleased
