 Why is it that they will come up with a great idea to make a product to create your own PVD's, but don't sell blank disk's? The Disks that come with the Media Wizard only hold about 20min of video which isn't enough for anything really. Why can't they make (and sell in stores like Wal-Mart,Zellers,Giant Tiger,Sears, etc) blank PVD's large enough to put a whole cartoon or even a movie on it? If they do, they should make them more available to the public. Overall, the VideoNow it's self is Great! But I wouldn't waste the money on the Media Wizard. It is almost impossible to fit anything on the disks
