 Just received my Original Big Wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box. I call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing. Went to the website for faster service................ After you fill out the information, it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand. Try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box. Looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging. Thumbs down until I can get the parts to repair
