 For Christmas, my mother bought this keyboard for my son. He was just a few days shy if his first birthday. Since he is always fascinated by Mommy and Daddy on their computers we all thought this would be a good idea. He absolutely was fascinated the first time we put this in front of him. I completely agree with previous people that the software that comes with this is basic. It is completely age appropriate for him since he's 1, but I couldn't imagine in 6 months this software keeping him interested in the slightest. For now though, it does. We do have the additional software as well and my only complaint is for the ones with an overlay I have to physically tape them to the keyboard for him to play with them. Once he's older that shouldn't be necessary but try to explain the logic of an overlay to a 1 year old is not really an option.
