 My [...] loves this desk. He really works the book that came with the LeapPad, and loves to do his art at the desk now. He usually wants to interact only with other people involved, but with this, he will focus so much at his desk, I dare not bother him. I would have given it 5 stars, but the chair makes me worry a little. He is pretty careful, but admittedly, the style of the chair makes it too easy to tip. He hasn't tipped over, but parents should still keep this in mind. I am very happy with this purchase
