 My one year olds twins received this for Christmas along with the Discover Sounds Kitchen. My daughter sticks her hand down the ball drop hole to pick up a ball instead of getting a ball from the side pocket. Once she has the ball in her hand, she cannot get her hand back out and hasn't figured out to drop the ball. This has happened three different times. Once, she walked off dragging the workshop behind her until I caught up with her. She was not injured, but was very upset. I sit right next to her when she is playing with the workshop, or put it up. My twins use the Discover Sounds Kitchen more often and we have not had any problems with it.
