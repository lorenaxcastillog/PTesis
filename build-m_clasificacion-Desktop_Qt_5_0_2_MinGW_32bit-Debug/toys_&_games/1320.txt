 I got these games about a year ago as an impulse buy. I was walking to the checkout line in some store and I saw it on a shelf. At first I was a little hesitant, I didn't know if I really just wanted to buy a Pacman game with some other crap on the sid. I then realized that it had Galaga and Pole Position and I was bought. Galaga has to be one of the garestest games ever made. Miss Pacmcn and Pole Position are pretty addicting too. Also, they're all the originals. Not some fake copied version that you can get for free online. You could play it for hours. It holds up well too. I hear about all these joysticks breaking after a few months and I'm scratching my haed wondering how they did that. This is probably one of the best video game buys I ever made, including Xbox 360. You will not regret it.
