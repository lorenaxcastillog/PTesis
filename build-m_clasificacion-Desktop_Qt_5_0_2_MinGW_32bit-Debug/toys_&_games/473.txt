 My 17 month old enjoys playing with this kitchen, mimicking Mommy. However, in the past few months she has REALLY shown an interest in kitchen playsets for 2+ that are for the child to stand at while using. She doesn't go to this kitchen as often as she used to. For her, this toy seemed to be at it's prime for about 3 months (12-15 months of age) and now she has moved on to the next level of play. It is a cute toy that introduces toddlers to kitchen "ideas", but it either needs more intrigue or a younger age to start. I think that when she was 9 months old or even just sitting up she would have had fun playing with parts of it-opening the refrigerator/microwave/or oven, hitting the stove to make the music play or turning the "water" in the sink to make the music play. She may have had more trouble with the shape sorter then, but I think toys are good to grow into. I do not recommend this as a 12-month toy. Wait a few months and buy one for 2+
