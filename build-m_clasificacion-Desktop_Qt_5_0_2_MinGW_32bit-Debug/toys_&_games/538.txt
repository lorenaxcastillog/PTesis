 I have been waiting for this game to come out for my daughter as a reward for potty training. My daughter just turned 3 and this game was very easy for her navigate, as the previous poster stated some of other V-Smile games are hard to control. The graphics and characters voices are as if your watching the Cartoon Dora. This game is also very educational with teaching spanish and english colors and numbers. Also they teach animal sounds and recognition of animals (both underwater and farm animals). Today was the first day we had it so I'm sure I'm missing a lot in this review, but this game is by far the best V-Smile game of them all and we have all the V-Smile games (we keep up to date when the new games come out).
