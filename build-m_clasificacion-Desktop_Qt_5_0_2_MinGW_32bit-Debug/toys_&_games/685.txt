 Now you can own Bertie the bus, Thomas' loyal friend who has always been there to help. Thomas first met Bertie when he got stuck in the snow. Terence came to rescue Thomas and Bertie came to pick up Thomas' passengers. The next time Thomas and Bertie met, Bertie challenged Thomas to a race. If you haven't seen that story, I will not tell you who won, but you can find that story on a lot of Thomas tapes. The only bad thing about this toy is that it doesn't have any magnets or anything but I guess your child will just have to use his/her imagination
