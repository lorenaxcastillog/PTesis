 I bought this puzzle for my 4 year old twin girls. They absolutely LOVE it. The pieces are cut along state lines, which makes this puzzle a great learning tool for geography. They currently know at least a dozen state names and where they are located within the continental US. After half a dozen times putting this puzzle together using the box as a guide, my daughters were able to put it together from memory. We have great conversations about each of the states and learn a little about each one. For example, the Washington state piece has a picture of an apple on it, so my kids now know that Washington is known for its apples. They also understand when I travel where I am going and how far I am going relative to where we live. I highly recommend this puzzle
