 I recently purchased the Magic Touch N' Crawl Pooh as a Christmas gift for my best friend's 7 month old little boy. I was so excited to read the rave reviews (with only one mentioning a mechanical sound). To my dismay and disappointment when Pooh arrived and was started, he sounded like a car wreck was occuring every time he turned his head! I was extremely disappointed and promptly returned him. (I must note that Amazon.com does make returning a purchase extremely easy.) Please be aware of this terrible sound that is much louder than the music that plays when considering purchasing this product
