 My son received the town & country wagon for Christmas when he was 2 years old, he is now 30 years old and has a son of his own, who will be riding in the same wagon he rode in. He took care of it and it is in the same condition as when he got it. It is a very good wagon and lasts forever if you don't abuse it. Kids have ridden in it, carried dolls, toys, etc in it and it is still here. We even use it under the Christmas tree each year with toys in it. My grandson and two granddaughters are enjoying it now as much as he did 30 years ago. Great buy for the money
