 I bought a few of these kits to use for a birthday party for my daughter turning 7 years old. I had all the kids paint one of the horses that they could take home. I also bought the Horse Stable and Corral kit and had all the children attending the party sign the roof. It was a really fun idea and now we have a fun reminder of who came to her 7th birthday party. The horses come in all different shapes and are made out of a nice wood. The paints are very good quality and are great horse colors. It was amazing how well they turned out being painted by 7 year olds. I definitely recommend this kit to anyone who loves horses
