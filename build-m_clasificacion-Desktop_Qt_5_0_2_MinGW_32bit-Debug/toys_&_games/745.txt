 I bought this house for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter for Christmas. I can honestly say it is the best money ever spent. I even got it at a great price during toys r us' by one get one free event last October. A friend and I were both getting them for our daughters so we got a great deal! Anyway.. she has played with this for several hours every single day since she got it. The only negative I can say about it is that sometimes it is hard to get her away from it so we can go places and sometimes she wants me to play a little too much!
