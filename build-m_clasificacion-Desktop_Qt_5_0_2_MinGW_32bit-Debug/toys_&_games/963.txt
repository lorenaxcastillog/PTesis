 I have not been following the Technic series for quite a while but when I saw this I knew I have to get it. And get it I did. It might be a bit pricey, and personally I don't like motorized pieces because of uncertainty (might go kaputt anytime), but this sure is a looker! However it is not all perfect, IMHO; the outriggers could have been made more powerful (how so is another matter). The turntable could have been geared. There could have been another pair of wheels (imagine). There could have been suspension in the wheels. And the dummy steering wheel in front looks rather ridiculous. But nonetheless this is still a master piece. What's next, a giant fire engine? Count me in
