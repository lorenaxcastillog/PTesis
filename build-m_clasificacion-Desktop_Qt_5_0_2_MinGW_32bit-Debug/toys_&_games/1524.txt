 This FP3 player is great! I deleted the pre-programmed songs but kept the stories. Now my 3 year old daughter can listen to her favorite songs and I don't have to worry whether the volume is too loud or if it will be damaged when she drops it. The software could be better - to add songs you have to have the CD and the program copies it from there but you can't move music files already on your computer. I only added 12 songs at approximately 3-4 minutes each but I think I could add almost 3x that amount
