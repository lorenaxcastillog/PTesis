 I bought this for my one and a half year old son for christmas and also recieved one as a gift. When I put many of the letters into the holder many letters said the WRONG letter. both sets did this, as the little tabs on the bottom can get stuck. So I returned one and kept the other. My son, now 2, enjoys playing with it and singing along and counting along with the songs. I wish it came with a storage case for all the letters. We have lost many of the letters and numbers under the sofa and who knows where else. They are rather awkward to keep on the fridge. but overall a nice toy, especially like that it has an off button with high and low volume
