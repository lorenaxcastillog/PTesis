 My toddler son LOVES anything Wiggles and thus, this dish set is his favorite. He follows me into the kitchen all the time asking "Where Go-Go's?" (he calls the Wiggles the "Go-Go's!)and just likes looking at the dishes! I have to limit the use of them sometimes because often he'll just dump out the plate or bowl just to look at the Wiggles! The cup has also been good for helping to encourage my son to transition to a lid-less cup and learn how to drink from something other than a sippy cup. One draw back, though, is that the set has no matching flatware. I know you can use any flatware, but a matching set would also help encourage some toddlers to learn to use a fork/spoon, too. Anyway, a must-have set for die-hard fans!
