 We got this for our just turned 4-yr old daughter and she LOVES it more than I expected her to. She wants to dance with the dvd every night and the look on her face is a joy to see! She was Cinderella during Halloween so she already had the dress and the glass slippers to go with it. I highly recommend this product. Tons of fun. Hard to find though. I got ours at Toys r Us 2 months before Xmas, it was the last one and the box was pretty beat up. never saw it at Toys r Us again, glad I got it
