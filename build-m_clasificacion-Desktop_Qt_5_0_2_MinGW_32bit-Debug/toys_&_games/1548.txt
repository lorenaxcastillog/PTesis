 First of all, YES the markers stain, so keep that in mind when having your children sit down to play with this. The GOOD news is that the stains DO come out. For those of you having problems try adding whatever clothing is stained to a bucket of HOT water... Pour 1/4th -1/2 cup of Hydrogen Peroxide into the bucket and let sit for 30-45 minutes. The stains DO come out.. This product is EXCELLENT for pre-schoolers who have an interest in drawing. I LOVE the trace mechanism on this and quite frankly it's one of the best "Trace" teaching tools i've seen. The children LOVE the "flourescent" look and it's been hard to get this away from them! You can also add pictures for them to draw by making your own..... Just use a white crayon or marker to highlight the picture and voila you have more pictures..
