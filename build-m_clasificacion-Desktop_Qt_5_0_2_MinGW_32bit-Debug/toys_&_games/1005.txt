 Both my boys, aged 6 and 3 (the younger being a little under-ag for this toy) simply love this toy. It's robust and is hanging in there so far (about a month into the deluge). There are MANY small parts so my sofa has also been enjoying the toy, but the good news is there are so many parts the boys don't seem to notice when one or two go missing. My only complaint is that the mechanism for weighing the anchor is a bit lame, but they seem to enjoy "fixing" it each time it pops off the deck.
