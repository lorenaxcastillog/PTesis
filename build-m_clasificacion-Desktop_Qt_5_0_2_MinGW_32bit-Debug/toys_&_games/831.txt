 We bought this house for my daughter for her 1st Birthday, we must have looked at about 15 different houses, this one stood out because it had a little table and built in chairs, opening shutters, a mail slot, and a working door and doorbell (although the doorbell did not work when we installed it and had to have the manufacturer replace it, which they were happy to do). Another bonus is the built in floor, so that if you choose to keep it outdoors (we haven't) little feet are not sitting in the dirt. She loves to play in this house it keeps her busy opening and closing the door and pushing 'mail' through the slot. She especially loves the table and chairs. I like that it's open and I can see what she's doing and she likes that she can be seen 'playing house'.
