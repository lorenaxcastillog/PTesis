 I bought this for my Twin 2 year old girls this past summer, and set it up in thier bedroom. The house is great quality, like all little tikes, the pieces fit together nice an snug. A few screws here and there, and BAM a house in thier bedroom. The house is rather large, But my girls didn't play with it too long, but they are spoiled. It is large enuff that I can climb inside and then they wanna play. The door did get ripped off within the first hour of play, so i just left it off. Still a great toy, I am now thinking about adding a 8" padded board across the bottom of the now open door, and filling the house with plastic balls(like chucky-cheese).
