 I don't normally write reviews, but after reading the only review for this item I felt I should. My girlfriend recently introduced me to the game a few months ago when we visited her aunt and uncle. I wanted to get the game for us to play. I checked the local Toys R Us they had the regular Rummikub for sale it was $20. I could tell it was cheaply made with plastic tiles. I then looked online for awhile and found this set and ordered it. We were very pleased with our purchase and talked all day about how nice of a set it was. The set has very well done ceramic tiles and a nifty carrying case. My only complaint would be that one of the hinges had come undone during shipping but was easily fixed. I come back today to buy a few more to give out for Christmas presents
