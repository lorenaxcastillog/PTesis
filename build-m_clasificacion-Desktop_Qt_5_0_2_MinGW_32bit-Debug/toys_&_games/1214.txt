 My son got this pull toy for his 1st birthday. He loves chasing it around the house as we pull it. He isn't walking yet, but I know he will love to pull it when he does. He had a frog-themed birthday party, so this frog was a hit. The legs move up and down as you pull it, which makes it interesting to watch and so cute. The quality is pretty good. The rubber on the wheels isn't consistent all the way around, so some of the wood touches the ground. The paint is wearing off in those places. Other than that, it is a great toy. That one thing would not keep me from buying it. Also, unlike many pull toys, the string seems long enough for pulling (some have really short strings). My 5 year old twin girls have a blast pulling it around for my son
