 this is an awesome toy....this is my son's very 1st hot wheels toy and he loves it. My husband likes it as well. :) It is a very sturdy toy and the cars are fine on the track. The only problem I have with it is that where the booster is and the batteries, it is very light. when the cars come around to go thru the booster, it really shakes and moves around a lot and lifts off the ground. It does not effect the track, but they could make that heavier so it does not move around on the floor....
