 My daughter received the loving doll house for Christmas and LOVED it, however our family consist of Mommy, Daddy, girl, boy and a golden retriever. When I spotted this item I was so happy to see I could duplicat my daughters real life family. She absolutly loved it. She actually played with just the dogs and accessories for 3 days. It was hard to find in stores so I just ordered it from amazon/toysrus. It was out of stock so she did not get it until after Christmas, but that was ok she said "more presents" when it came in the mail
