 I bought this kit for my 6 year old daughter. She couldn't wait to start drawing. She dictated the story for each page and drew extra "love notes" on the remaining pages, and even deticated it to her Nan Nan. We opted to add the "About the auther" with a photo! My daughter did get impatient waiting for the book to come back,.. but since Katrina the mail has been very unreliable. Finally, her package arrived and she LOVED it! We rushed it right over to her Nan Nan. It is a perfect little book, that will be cherished forever. I've already bought 2 more!
