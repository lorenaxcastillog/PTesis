 We bought this playhouse for our daughter's 2nd B-day. First of all, let me say it is a beautiful playhouse! The door-bell doesn't ring loudly and the play phone rings the same way. It was very easy to build, but it took two people, for holding purposes. The front porch is very roomy but as you enter into the house it's VERY SMALL inside, 30 1/2 wide by 41 1/2 long!!! Overall, the house is quite large appearing as you view from the outside. The inside is LITTLE. I really can't see two children being able to play in the house part without knocking into each other. I really liked the porch idea but i just didn't realize that it took away sooo much inside the house section. I really like Step2 and we have several of their products but this one will have to go back. Sorry Step2!
