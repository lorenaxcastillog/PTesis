 I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for, but the bottom line is that this product is finger paint. It is labeled as finger paint, and even though clear, it is still a paint product. It will be messy on your fingers, and like any finger paint, you should cover your surfaces- throw down some news paper or a place-mat first. Voila! Easy clean-up. That being said, I think it's a great product for the recommended age. My daughter started with color wonder products at 18 months. Now, at almost 3, she actually enjoys them and is (somewhat) responsible with them. We take the marker sets everywhere: on airplanes, to restaurants, to grandma's house, in the stroller, etc. True, the paint has a Vaseline-like consistency, but traditional finger-paint is like pudding anyway. Color Wonder Finger Paint does clean up well, the colors blend nicely and create really interesting swirls of colors (think easter egg dyes) and will provide hours of fun to a age-appropriate child who can handle waiting a moment for the color to appear. Part of the fun is the anticipation of the magic picture to show up. Just try it, what could you lose
