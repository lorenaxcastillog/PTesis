 We bought this playzone after we returned the superyard. The reason we returned the superyard is because it is not sturdy, hard to set up, and high to be stepped over because it does not have a door. We are very satisfied with the playzone and recommend you to consider this product. The little door is helpful for the children and adult to go in and out, but yet I feel safe to know my baby would not know how to open the door. The set up is pretty easy, but most of all, the color and the toys that come with it. It makes my living room more like a childcare and not a children prison. The only thing that made me unsatisfied completely is the shipping cost. I want to buy some more corner extensions, but the shipping cost is almost the same as the price itself, and this product is not sold in stores.
