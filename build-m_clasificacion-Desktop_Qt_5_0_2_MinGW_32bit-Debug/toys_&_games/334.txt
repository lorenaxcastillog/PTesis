 We recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight (would not give it up sooner). My son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four. This bed is durable! The bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new. It is so easy to wipe clean. My son feels that his bed is special and just adores it. He sees "regular" beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car. I have a feeling he'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. Five stars
