 We gave our 3 yr. old granddaughter this barn for Christmas. She already LOVES horses as her daddy takes her with him to the track or barns to check on his race horses. I own a riding horse,also, whom she adores. When she opened this gift, she and our other granddaughter,who is 2 1/2, just went "bonkers". We had to remove the barn from the scene because they wouldn't look at anything else! They also were fighting over it! We gave our 2 1/2 granddaughter another barn since she loves animals of all types, but THIS BARN was definitely the "Big Hit"! It is really beautifully made, large enough for the model horses of all sizes, and will last for many years
