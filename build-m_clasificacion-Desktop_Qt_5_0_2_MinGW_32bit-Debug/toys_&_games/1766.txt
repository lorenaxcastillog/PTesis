 I bought this for our 6-year-old twins, and we've genuinly enjoyed playing it with them. It has rules for younger kids as well as rules for adult play, and even playing with the kid's rules, my husband and I enjoy the game as much as they do. It doesn't take long to finish a game, which is great with their relatively short attention spans, and the kids win as often as we do, so they enjoy the challenge of beating Mom and Dad. I would highly recommend this one to anyone with kids. It's a perfect addition to family game night.
