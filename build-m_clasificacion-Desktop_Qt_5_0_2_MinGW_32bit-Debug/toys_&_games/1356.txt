 This is not the toy for a child who has no other toys! I would not buy this doll for Toys for Tots. We kept it because; 1-It's a hassle to return it. 2 The child has tons of toys anyway. This doll has soft ragdoll legs. It's not very beautiful. It does talk nicely. I would have tried the other dolls that speak languages if I had known about the soft legs. I am so bummed about the legs. What if you bought it for a poor child who has nothing to play with and then the legs being only fabric wear out? Bummer!
