 Ok, I don't understand the negative reviews for this game! This is such a fun great game. The little ones can play it because their isn't any reading involved. Yes, an adult has to take 5 minutes to set up. The leaves do not come out... I am not really comprehending what is being done wrong. And yes the game is quick... you have bees being balanced on leaves... after the first 5 pulls the bees begin to slowly drop on people. That is the purpose of the game afterall. It is fun and a quick game unlike some tedious games like "Candy Land". As a parent of 3 kiddies under 5... I am very happy when games are quick and fun
