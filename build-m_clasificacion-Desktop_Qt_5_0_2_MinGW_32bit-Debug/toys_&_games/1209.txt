 This is a very fun game to play. I'm sure everyone who is a fan of the show (as well as most people who aren't) would like to play it. I hope for those of you who have posted that the game only turns off by itself read this, because you can manually turn off the game by holding the on/off button for a couple of seconds. To turn on is a simple click, to turn off is holding it. The sound is very interesting when it calculates the odds, just like the sounds of the show. Just stinks Howie doesn't speak in it, it would have been good to hear him say Deal or No Deal. I certainly recommend the game thoug
