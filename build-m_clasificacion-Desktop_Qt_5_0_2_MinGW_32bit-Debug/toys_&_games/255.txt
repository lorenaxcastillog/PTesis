 I'm here to find replacement parts for this toy. My daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this, and right when she got it together, one of the wires attached to the light broke off, when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection. We can't solder it back in, there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we don't want to order another one, just to make her happy. Seriously, this toy is a piece of crap. I gave the toy high marks for educational value, because it teaches kids an important lesson. Once corporations have your money, they don't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it, or have fun, or will need replacement parts, they only want to get MORE money off you, somehow. Also, buyer beware is an important lesson.
