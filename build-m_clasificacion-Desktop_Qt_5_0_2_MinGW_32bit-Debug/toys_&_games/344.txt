 My 8 yr old grandson wanted this for Christmas but the price was over $100 so when I saw it for under $15 on Amazon, I got it for his birhtday in February. He and his 9 yr old brother LOVE it! I also purchased one booster pack at the same time. Then I found another game and booster pack at Target for a very reasonable price. So he got the game system, two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00! Both he and I were happy! (The only reason I give this a "4" is because the games are a bit hard to come by
