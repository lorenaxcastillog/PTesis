 This product differs from what I found in the store because the loom is made of metal; those I found in the stores were plastic and I was told would break with use. When I was a little girl, I had the metal loom and made potholders for all my family members for gifts. I wanted my grandchildren to enjoy that same experience. Only a week after Christmas, I got my first new potholder! I am confident that the loom won't break and the children are learning about color and how combinations work together while creating something useful, making them proud
