 My son received this toy as a present from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box. I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system. While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right. While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system. I have only one complaint and that is I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters. My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages. But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.
