 I WAS TORN AT WHAT REMOTE CONTROL CAR TO BUY MY 4 YEAR OLD SON. THE SALES CLERK AT THE DISNEY STORE COULDN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CAR, MY SON IS A HUGE "CARS" FAN--I WAS SOLD!! IT NEVER WORKED, IT JUST JERKED A LITTLE BIT! MY 2 YEAR OLDS FISHER PRICE CAR WORKS A LOT BETTER FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE. NOW I GOT THE BOYS FIGHTING OVER THE BABY CAR AND DON'T EVEN ASK FOR LIGHTNING MCQUEEN. I AM GOING BACK TO THE STORE AND GET MY MONEY BACK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TOY!! THANK YOU.
