 I wanted something for the adults to play at Christmas that would definitely make people laugh. This definitely hit the spot. We played with eight people, of which four of them had already had their share of drinks, and that just made it all the more fun. Listening to someone try to figure out the phrases can be hilarious. For anyone who actually knows how to have a good time and wants to have fun, this game will do it. I played later with my twelve year old, and it was just as fun with her. She can't wait to play it with her friends, and my eighteen year old daughter can't wait to take it and play with her friends. It's a good laugh for a lot of different ages
