 We purchased this table for our 3 yr old son for Christmas and he was VERY excited to see it set up "under" the tree. He plays with it quite a bit, loves the track and all the pieces that came with it. Everything is made of wood and seems to be good quality. The table top has a nice road and building scene painted on it with bright colors, it's very cheerful. The track pieces fit with other wooden track pieces from other sets pretty well. The only thing I would change is for the table to be a little taller. It's at a pretty good height so that he can walk around the table moving the trains on the track and such, but a little higher table might last him a little longer. The table was also very easy to assemble. My husband did it Christmas Eve in less than an hour, with no swearing or throwing of parts!! We think the table is great.
