 I just bought this doll for my 4 year old daughter. I found it very difficult to find a doll that had brown hair and brown eyes that wasn't an African American doll. This doll is also very comfortable to carry for a little girl. It isn't too big or too small with a soft body and she smells sweet. My daughter is over the moon with her new 'baby' that looks like her. She carries her new "Baby Anna" (her name for this doll) everywhere and is acting like quite a little mommy. This is a FANTASTIC doll thank you Fisher Price for realizing that not all little girls have blonde hair and blue eyes
