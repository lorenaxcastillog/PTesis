 My child is always trying to get my keys from me as I strap him into his car seat and try and get on the road and he cries when I have to take them away to actually start the car. I took to giving him the house keys a few times, but then lost them for a while only to find them a month later deep within the inside of the car seat..okay so I'm not a genius. When I saw this product I thought- great! It looks close enough to the real thing, it just might fool him ionto thinking he's getting his hands on the real thing! Its a pretty good product overall, he is certainly interested in it and accepts them as a replacement for the actual car keys during the strapping in routine. One thing, I wish the body of the key chain were a bit more true to life size, as well as the actual keys. He IS a baby, but he also knows the difference. As all moms know, as with the fake cell phones, even as they get more and more sophisticated, your baby can always sniff out a fake..
