 My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.
