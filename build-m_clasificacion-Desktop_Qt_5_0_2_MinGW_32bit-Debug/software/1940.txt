 The NIV Rainbow Study Bible is an excellent product. I must congratulate the author and his support team for such a wonderful and thorough job. I received this gift from my boss eleven years ago and still I am and will always be an avid reader/student of the Bible. It has been such a helpful tool in understanding the Bible that I have been giving it to my friends and family. I use the maps, diagrams, subject guide, concordance, and the analysis at the beginning of each book. Most of all I just love the color coding with the different subjects like, Faith, Family, God etc; this makes study interesting and gives a "hands-on" insight into the inspired Word of God. This NIV version is reader-friendly in a language that is easy to understand and follow along, as against the earlier versions, which made comprehension a bit challenging for me. During my study I also compare NIV's contents and interpretations against another version and so far no content has been lost through the interpretation. My one desire is have it in a smaller size so that I can carry it around wherever I go! I would defintely recommend this product.
