 This system is very good for road trips. I just went on a road trip for spring break and it worked. I had a similar system from back in 1999 from Co-Pilot. The Co-pilot system was not a accurate but had some features that should have been in Streets and Trips. For instance Co-pilot had a voice recognition and could verbalize the turn by turn directions. It could also answer select question such a 'how far' 'next turn'... Over all I am giving Streets and Trips 4 stars because is does have a great receiver and an incredible number of points of interest. I would buy it again but just expected more from a product 8 years newer than my last system. I mean think about how far laptops have come.
