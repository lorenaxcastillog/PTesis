 Outstanding! The copy protection kind of stinks but the software itself is GREAT! Very, very realistic driving experience. On-screen performance matches the true vehicle's performance. Many customizaton options. I did end up downloading a "cheat" to give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but the overall experience is outstanding! I would highly recommend this software to any racing enthusiast
