 So, the interface for the new version of Internet Security is very nice and is very easy to use. I have used the previous version in the past upon the recommendation from CNET as the one of the best internet security suites available. I have not been disappointed. The software was very easy to setup and start up and seems to be very secure with regular updates and scans. Fortunately, I have a prety isolated network so I don't worry too much about virus contamination but I do want to monitor my network's usage - especially since I have a wirless system. The software allows me to monitor such activity easily and alerts me to anyone trying to get on without permission. The one time I did have a virus, the realtime scan function caught it before it could embed itself into my system and deleted the malicious code immediately. I haven't seen too much activity overall from the sentry software which is a good thing (I think) and attests to the overall functionality of the software (I think). Either this is a great piece of programming or my computer has been taken over by spyware gangsters in Russia and I'm none the wiser. I hope this help
