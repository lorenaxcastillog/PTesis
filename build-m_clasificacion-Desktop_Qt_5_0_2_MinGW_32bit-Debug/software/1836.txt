 Every anti-spyware program has its pros and cons... no single program can find everything... Pros: Its had good reviews in a couple of magazines, and on NPR. It has an Internet Shield, Startup Shield, etc so it can alert you if anything has been added to your PC that you don't want. It finds some things that other programs do not (and other programs find things that this does not). Cons: Cost. Ad aware and Spybot search and destroy are free. Also, I'm not sure how up to date they keep their database. Its one of the OK programs if you decide to pay for one. E-trust's pest patrol has had better reviews (Maximim PC). Overall grade: B
