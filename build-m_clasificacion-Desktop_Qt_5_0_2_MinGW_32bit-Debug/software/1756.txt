 This is my 3rd year doing my taxes with TurboTax. I encountered some bugs with non-material stuff, but I didn't go and hand-check the entire return so I don't know if there would have been any material bugs that would actually affect the dollar amounts. The bugs that I encountered were the following: - When asking me for changes to my address which it imported from last year's return, it didn't provide phone numbers. One of those phone numbers had changed. Later, when doing the state taxes, it asked which phone number I wanted to use. At that time, it provided a choice of the old phone number but didn't allow me to update it. - It seemed to import all the information from my financial institution OK and it reported the dollar amounts of the net proceeds and cost basis correctly. However, on the worksheet, even though the description said it was a sale of 50 shares, the quantity field said one share. Little bugs like these make me wonder if all the math being done underneath is OK. I'm also worried that if you run the program in a different order, the results might be different. But who knows? With a cursory check things looked OK. One thing that I was bummed about was that when entering the buys corresponding to a stock sale it allowed me to enter things in reverse chronological order (and in fact didn't prompt me otherwise) and yet at the end of the program when doing audit checks, it wanted me to reenter the data in chronological order. I didn't bother since it only affected a worksheet. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there are no material errors! Unfortunately, it looks like other tax products also have these kinds of weird bugs
