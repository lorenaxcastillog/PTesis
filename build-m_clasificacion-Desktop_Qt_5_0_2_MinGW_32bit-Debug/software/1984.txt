 As previous reviewers have mentioned, you should make sure your hardware and software is XP compatible before you buy. Assuming everything is compatible Windows XP upgrade is a breeze to install, once installed it is very funtional and stable. The main irritation about previous Windows operating systems was the instability. My Windows XP installation has not crashed a single time since I installed 768 MB of Ram. For a stable system it is very important that you have enough Ram. When I only had 256 MB of ram installed the system was not much more stable than Windows 98 SE. I am very pleased with Windows XP, you will be too, if you have enough Ram, and XP Compatible software and hardware.
