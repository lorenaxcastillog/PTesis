 I purchased this to give to my mom for Mother's Day last year. She's in the process of trying to figure out what to do with her backyard and I figured this would be an ideal tool for her to use in order to get a preview of her backyard. She's fiddled around with it some, but has yet to upload photos of her backyard and really start messing around with it, but I suspect she'll get into it in due time
