 I originally bought a CD-DVD-RW drive that shipped with the O.E.M version of Nero 7. Every so often it would "freeze-up" and I would have to reboot the computer. Since I bought the full blown edition of Nero 7 there has been no "freeze-ups". What I really liked about this edition is it comes with about 20 programs and you have the option to install which ones you feel you may need
