 Pros: Simple to setup and use CD has S/W easy to install Editing capability to fine tune tracks' start and end times Cons: Default in Wave Corrector program not to put a suffix can be changed but on each save; cannot change default setting permanently. Intensive PC activity may cause program to skip a moment in recording (start that track over). Cannot append to an existing file. Could do a better job of finding gaps between tracks. Despite the Cons (I'm just telling you what could be better), the product does a good job of copying records and cleaning the sound. Worth the money if you have records in good shape and hate to spend money buying CDs to get them portable. Peace, LJ
