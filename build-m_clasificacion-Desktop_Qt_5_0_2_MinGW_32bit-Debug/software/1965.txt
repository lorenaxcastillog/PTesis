 This software seems brilliant - does a very accurate job of scanning and decoding. It could be improved by allowing for multiple page scans (without having to set a timer for page insert)It will defintely save you time. IT does not appear to have an page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 Stars for its scanning and decoding. Registration becomes a problem if you have to reinstall the software several times (I redo my computer frequently), it is not smart enough to know it is the same machine and forces you to contact technical support. MS Office will recognise its the same machine so its not a hassle. If you are interested in document storage and filing on the computer then other ocr might be a better choice. If you want ACCURATE page scanning for modification and changes I would MOST HIGHLY recommend this software.
