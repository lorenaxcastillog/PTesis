 Microsoft's OneNote is a vast improvement over its original release. It is more intuitive, easier to navigate and just plain easier to use. As a writer it has significantly improved my productivity in compiling interivews and notes for my articles. I recommend it very highly and I do not, as a rule, make such recommendations lightly. More bang for the buck
