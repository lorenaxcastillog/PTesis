 I found many improvements in overall manageability, but some have taken time to get used to. The application window that opens for some filters is too much for me. I do love the ease with which I can move from Photoshop to Painter as I use both. Since Photography is my main reason for Photoshop, Bridge is great for working with RAW (once I figured it out), but as a browser for finding images I had to learn to adjust to it. The old browser was simpler to use. Sometimes I do not want it around in the background, and now I just close it out. For me Bridge was the biggest new addition. I like the rename feature, metadata, file info window, RAW adjustment. The rest of Photoshop was a natural upgrade and was easy to move into.
