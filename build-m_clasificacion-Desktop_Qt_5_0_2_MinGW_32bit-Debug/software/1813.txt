 I gave my grandson, ages 12 & 15, the Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007 for Christmas. I thought it would be a wonderful aide in the subjects they were studing at school. However, my concern was..."Would it be difficult to navigate and not be used or would they even use it enough to discover all the benefits of the software?" Well, they are raving about how great it has been in assisting them with their schoolwork...especially in Geometry and Algebra. Mom loves it too because the math help not only gives the answer but explains the steps on how to arrive at the answer. For my book...money well spent. It is so hard to buy a gift for teenagers that they get excited about... especially one that pertains to schoolwork. I was well pleased with their excitement about the product. I was satisfied with how easy the program was to use. Use the product once and you will find a live-in tutor
