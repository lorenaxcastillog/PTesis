 When I first switched over to the Mac (after years of believing in Windows XP's superiority, mind you), it was a Powerbook G4 with Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. After using it for just a few minutes, I was finally convinced that I was wrong about Mac vs. Windows in a big way. Once you get used to it, OS X is not only easier to use, but it is prettier, more powerful, and far more stable as well. Tiger improves on that platform. My favorite new feature is Dashboard, which brings a whole bunch of handy little apps to your fingertips, such as a calculator, calendar, stock tracker, weather forecast, dictionary, sticky notes, and hundreds more available for download at Apple's website. Spotlight is also a cool feature; certainly better than any other search feature I've used. Microsoft will be coming out with its new Vista OS pretty soon, which basically steals most of OS X's ideas. Personally, I could care less. Give me OS X any day. I will be one of the first in line to buy Leopard when it comes out this spring
