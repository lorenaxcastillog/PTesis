 My husband and I bought two copies when it was a Gold Box featured product so he could install it on both of our computers. He is a computer consultant and rates ZoneAlarm at 4 stars because, after using it for a few weeks, we find too many spurious alerts for items that ZA should have had on their "safe" list, particularly the "suspicious activities" of the OS Firewall. This program is puzzling for a casual user such as myself to navigate alone. I would still rather have more protection than I can handle, rather than a dummied-down version that I would understand better but that might not provide the virus protection we need, but he says he wouldn't recommend this to his novice clients unless they wanted a lot of hands-on control of their systems.
