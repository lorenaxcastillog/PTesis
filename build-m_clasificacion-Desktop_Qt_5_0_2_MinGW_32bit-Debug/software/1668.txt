 Given that this is a stripped down version of some of Sonic Foundry's more powerful (and expensive) professional tools, Acid Music 3.0 is still a pleasant surprise. I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, "paint" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth. Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone. This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music. But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces. I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation. It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program. It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing
