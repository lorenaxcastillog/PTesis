 I resisted upgrading my 2004 version, especially after reading the reviews here. But the R4 release upgraded all by business, bank, and investment accounts without any problems. For business, the accountants would rather you use Quickbooks, but since mine is a simple service based business, I still refuse. Quicken works just fine and having everything in one place is just too valuable. It looks largely the same as 2004. But I was impressed by the online improvements, which is why the 2004 version is not longer supported. Now, it will automatically rename things the way you like. Since this eases the biggest problem of using software like Quicken, namely the discipline to enter and label everything, it a huge benefit. If you are looking to get control over your cashflow, and see the forest through the trees, this is the program. Learn it, know it, live it
