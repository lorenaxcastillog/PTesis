 I found this to be a very good teaching tool to learn to play rock style music. I have never played the guitar before only the violin for eight years while in school. Now I am in my thirties and thought it would be too difficult to learn to play. I have been through the first four lessons and so far it is great. I can work at my own pace, repeat sections I find difficult and play actual songs with lyrics. It is great to play real music not just practice the chords and riffs (although practice is required, it is just more fun). Great piece of sofware. I combined this with a couple of books to study when not at the computer and this worked great for me. Great job eMedia. I look forwrard to additional eMedia song books for rock music
