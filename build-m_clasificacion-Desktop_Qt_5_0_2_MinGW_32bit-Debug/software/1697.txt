 I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas
