 I have used a voice to text translation device for several years. I was interested in the Dragon NaturallySpeaking product for two reasons. My current product is much less accurate than I would choose. Secondly, it does not provide automatic punctuation. The advertisement for Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard suggested that it not only increased accuracy, but did that without training, and it provided autopunctuation. I purchased the product and met with a disappointment when it arrived. Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard will not install with less than 512 MB of RAM. I didn't know that. My machine had 256 MB. I had to purchase an additional 512 MB in order to load the product. While I was waiting for the memory to come, I used the new microphone on my old product. The new microphone was at least five times better than my old one. The accuracy went up. I was very happy about that. When the memory arrived, I installed the product. I was surprised when it asked to go through a training exercise, but I did it anyway. I was impressed with the increased accuracy. That was very good, but the autopunctuation wasn't there. I found out that that is an option. When I turned on the option. It began to work. It doesn't do as good a job as I would hope, but for normal sentences, it's okay. All in all, I like the new product. I also like the rebate that may be quite affordable. I hope this evaluation helps
