 Microsoft Student has exceeded my expectations. It includes Microsoft Math which is an incredibly useful program--it has the following advantages over a graphing calculator: 1) it is MUCH faster, 2) it can explains intermediate steps on certain types of algebra problems, 3) the user interface is both easier and more pleasant to work with, 4) symbolic input is allowed, meaning you can work with such things as cube roots without using clumsy keyboard workarounds, and 5) it is cheaper than a graphing calculator! I have not yet used the other components of MS Student, but they look promising, too
