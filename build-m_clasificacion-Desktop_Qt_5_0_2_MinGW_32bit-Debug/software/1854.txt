 It is very easy to go wrong with this product. It is being brought out in a relatively simple form that you just know is going to grow. It is NOT photoshop or even photoshop like. It isn't what you use to fix a picture (though you sure can). Something has happened. Film is going away. People used to have to pay for film and for images that were anything from totally black to whiteout with maybe 1 good image out of 24? Now we preview and shoot freebies as digital. Lots and lots of pictures. Some of us shoot over 1000 images in one outing. Ohhhh, but it gets more hairy than that. Now digital cameras are taking images that are as good in print as film. And - if you use the original data from the camera (in raw form called RAW data) rather than an automatically interpreted shrunk (JPEG) version, you might even get paid money for what you take. But those unshrunk RAW files are big? Yes. So how do you zip through 1000 RAW data files and sort them into Aunty EM, Lion, Scare Crow, Oz... or make a slide show, or print certain ones or make contact sheets. and brighten 30 at a time or boost the contrast in this bunch - fast.
