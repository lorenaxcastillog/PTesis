 I've used TurboTax for 3 years now! And again this year the software is the easiest way ever to do your taxes. Now I don't dread waiting till the last minute. I love to see the "Federal Tax Due" box get smaller and smaller. It is easy to download - no problems like some software. If you have the time to work on your own taxes then I suggest this program. Need help with a question - you can use the help box, get live help...
