 Outlook 2007 did not carry all the fancy visual changes that other applications from the 2007 suite did (e.g. Word, Excel...), but the changes were quite awesome. First, it now has a sidebar with your tasks, a calendar and TO DOs... When you are on the calendar tab, you will notice a beter organization and, on the bottom, there will be the tasks due each day. Integration with other calendar tools and online schedules is much better. Also, it is much better integrated with Windows Mobile. If you buy Office 2007 Home and Student, don't forget to buy at least one copy of this Outlook because it is not in there and it is necessary for synching your Windows Mobile device.
