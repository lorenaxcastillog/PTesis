 I previsouly used an accountant for my S-corp (federal, state and NYC) returns as well as (federal and state) personal returns. That can easily come to $1000. With turbotax you save a bunch around $750. The business product DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE RETURN which is another $50, and the NYC return is an additional $50 (available from inside the program). I used it the first time this year, I am pretty good with numbers, accounting and excel. It tool me well over 10 hours to enter the business returns after having all my numbers estimated in excel. The customer support by email was helpful as was the community forum, but responses are not always quick. and it is a time consuming process to research questions. The is VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE in filling out the state and NYC return. TT basically gives you the form and let you fill in the areas not generated by numbers on the federal return. TT reviews those returns for errors which certainly adds some value (relative to pencil and paper). It was too difficult for me to fill in state and NYC myself off the fed business return without any software, so I don't see that as an option (to save $100) despite the limited additional information needed. BOTTOM LINE - The first year using it will probably cause some of your hair to turn grey, subsequent years should be much easier. The navigation and interface is not intuitive enough for to make the first year smoot but over the years you can save a substancially in preparing you own taxes. One strategy might be to try it one year and run it by a tax accountant (as training wheels) and then in subsequent years do it on your own. (of course year one would be time consuming and expensive but that probably makes sense in the long run.
