 I used to have Norton for years. After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough. I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.) So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings. I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky. Well two years later I have not looked back. I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out. They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc. After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle. When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in. Talk about nerve. No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest
