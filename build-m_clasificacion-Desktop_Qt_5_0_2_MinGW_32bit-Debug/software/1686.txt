 I have yet to make a card with this software, but that is by choice...I prefer photo cards, and find it's easier to make the outside of a card with my Canon photo software, and the inside with Digital Image. I love the stationery section on this, however...lots of choices of paper designs, and it's very easy to use. I just can't figure out how to make the text larger, if you can. When you're typing up your letter, it has LARGE text; when you print your letter it has SMALL text. Making an envelope is easy, too...it's the only easy software I have for that! Only, I have to go to my Control Panel to click in my Canon printer properties to change the paper type to envelope. The Hallmark software doesn't allow this--at least not the envelopes that directly follow stationery printing, although it allows it when printing your letter. If I don't change the Canon to envelope, I'm left with ink tracks on my envelopes. (There is a separate envelope category, however, that I haven't used. Maybe that one brings up the printer properties.) There are loads of fun projects in this software, and it's a very colorful software. About installation...mine was a nightmare.
