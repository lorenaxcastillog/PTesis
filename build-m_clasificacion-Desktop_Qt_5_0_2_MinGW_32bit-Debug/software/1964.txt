 I have been using Readiris 11 for about two and a half months on a project I work on about 4 to 6 hours a day. The project is to put a book I wrote about 25 years ago that was typewritten but never published onto a CD as a course. So it involves using Readiris to read the pages into Word where I edit the work. The Readiris wizard (without tinkering which was a disaster) and pages with dark ink work best. If the pages are light because of typewriter ribbon age, I must first darken them in Photoshop and then print them out for Readiris. I found that Readiris does a wonderful job and is worth every penny
