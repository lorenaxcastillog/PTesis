 This memory improvement software is marvelous. It helps you improve your memory providing you with motivating games that will let you keep one playing. The only question you need to ask yourself before buying this software "Is English your mother language?" as the most of the games are words games.. In fact, I loved the software although I'm not first language speaker. While playing, the words that are new to me disturbed me from getting high scores. Highly Recommended for English first language speakers.. Looking forward to seeing this software in other languages.
