 I bought Premiere after I discovered that the software that came with my new DVD Palmcorder didn't let me edit on my PC. Somewhere I ascertained that Premiere did permit this, and indeed it does. I found it very easy to use, so much so that I was able to get my first two "productions" up on YouTube in a matter of perhaps two hours. Obviously I have not learned everything this product has to offer, nor do I use very well what I have already discovered, but it was easy to get results that, for a rank beginner, actually look sort of polished. This product would get five stars from me if it accepted DVD-RAM from my Palmcorder. It does not, and I nearly gave the product five stars anyway because my inquiry to their customer service people produced a very helpful and completely candid response that was clearly personalized for me. In other words, the quality of the customer support almost erased a small deficiency in the product. Overall, this is a really good product
