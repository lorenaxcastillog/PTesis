 I have had both McAfee and Norton over the past three years. McAfee subsriptions would expire early and customer service could never help long term. Their website was no help. Norton's hindered my system performance dramatically and its' Junk Mail interface would only sporadically load in Outlook. I did my research this time and heard much the same from other reviewers. Purchased Zone Alarm, received a competitive rebate from my old Norton disk and installed it. It installed smoothly and interfaces seamlessly with my Outlook, doing a great job in segregating Spam. The ratings filters work great and my system just hums along. The scans and automatic updates work perfectly. No complaints here and I have had it over 3 month
