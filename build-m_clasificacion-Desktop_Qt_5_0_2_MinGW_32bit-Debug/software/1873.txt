 I've used Quicken since around 2004-2005, and have upgraded with each new release. Quicken 2007 is not without a few bugs and quirks, but has nonetheless served as a worthy upgrade for me, and I certainly have not had the dismal experience that some are reporting. The primary change in 2007 is the interface. It's just much easier for me to find and run reports in this version. I also love the cash flow feature integrated with the calendar, where you can set up known income & expenses and monitor your cash flow. Just a great tool. I also found it easy to set up accounts and integrate with credit card statements. I have not yet set up investments or mortgage but that's the next step. There have been a few quirks. A couple of times I've clicked a button and the program has just closed. Also, I had to reinstall the product at one point because the automated account setup screen kept popping up every time I started the program (actually the underlying reason why I did a reinstall was b/c I was a bit hasty and set up some things incorrectly; once I figured out what I'd done I decided it's just be easier to start from scratch). But the reinstall did seem to solve the problem with the setup screen. About the only thing I can say that I don't like about the program is that when you are in the register, the control buttons for that entry do not allow you to see the next line item in the registry. A few times I've been looking for a specific expense and it was hidden just b/c I so happened to be on the entry above it. However this is a relatively minor issue. In short, if you're happy with Quicken 2006 then you probably don't need to spend the money on an upgrade at this point. But if you've found some of the reporting and other features a little cumbersome to figure out, then 2007 solves this problem with a much cleaner interface
