 After removing Symantec and installing Zonealarm my computer speeded up by a factor of at least 10. I'm not certain why Symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast - in my case it insisted on scanning every program transferred and used and on scanning every outgoing email even though I truned those features off. I recommend Zonealarm for users with some expertise - during the initial usage you need to understand what programs to allow and what to block (look them up on Google)
