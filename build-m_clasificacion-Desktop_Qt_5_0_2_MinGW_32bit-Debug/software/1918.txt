 well when i first got this game, i didn't know what to do. but there is something called the tutorial where it helps you play the game. this really helped me.so when you get to the options menu, click on scenario and click on tutorial.and once you take care of 10 bunnies you go on to cats then you go on to something else.this game is a little confusing but fun
