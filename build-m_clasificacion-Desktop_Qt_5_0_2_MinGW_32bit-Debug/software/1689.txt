 I do quite a bit of teaching, so the latest versions of Power Point and Word are very useful to me. This software does feature some significant improvements of the 2000 edition, such as better presentation formats and backgrounds for Power Point, easier inclusion of graphics, animations, etc., and the new features for Word are also nice improvements. The price for these upgrades was reasonable as well
