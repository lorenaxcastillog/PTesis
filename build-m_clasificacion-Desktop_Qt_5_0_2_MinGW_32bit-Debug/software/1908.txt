 Good product but when are they going to fix the screen that says you have not UPGRADED ! ! ! ! It drives me nutz to have that pop up every time I go to Quicken online. I have written as I'm sure others have but still it is there with no way to remove it even after "registering" my upgrade. Quicken is easy to learn, easy to use, maybe not so easy to import and export data as it is very propriatary but still and all I love it online for portfolio views and data at a glance.
