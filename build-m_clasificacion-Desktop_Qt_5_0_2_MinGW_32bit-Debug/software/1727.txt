 This product, as well as other software developed by Sonic Foundry, is used in the gaming industry. It was even used to make the music in Summoner! I've been using this product for a while, and I have made tunes like THAT and saving them as MP3s, WAVs, and so forth. Heck, if I make a digital home video or something, I can rig it with music by adding the music in with ACID Music! Get this if you want to make games with tunes, show off to friends and make them say &quot;Damn! You couldn't have made this!&quot;, or if you got other reasons to make some good music without needing to hire an orcastra (eat your heart out, John Williams)
