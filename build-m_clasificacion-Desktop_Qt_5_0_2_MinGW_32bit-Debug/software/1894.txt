 We've been using this program for our business for about a year now. I find it to be easy to use and a good value for the money. We used it to create invoices for our customers, to keep track of our checkbook, to have easy access to the amount of our sales each month, quarter and for the year and more. I would recommend it for small businesses starting out.
