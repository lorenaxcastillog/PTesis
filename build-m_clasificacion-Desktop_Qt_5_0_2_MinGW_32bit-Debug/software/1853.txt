 I've just started using Lightroom 1.0 and I love it. I especially love the organizational capabilities and the develop module is terrific. There is a bit of a learning curve, but with time I know that Lightroom and I will be producing some superb images. I'm not sure yet if I will bite the bullet for CS3. Digital photography is always expanding, always improving and alas....always getting more expensive. What does annoy me is the current trend towards very little printed documentation. Lightroom arrived with a little booklet...only much later did I discover the documentation file on the cd. What ever happened to providing a basic book with the software???
