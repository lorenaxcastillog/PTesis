 This is a very nice product. Chosing what you want to paint or change is very simple. It installed easily and is quite simple to learn. My dislikes are that you do not have the option of manually adjusting the color tone. Many of the colors appear to be one color in the color selection panel but are much lighter when placed on the project. It would be nice to be able to manually darken or bighten the color. Because I was limited to the color selections they offer, I was not able to find the right color for my kitchen
