 Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them. Plus it is only 70 issues but for 9 bucks thats awesome. I think they could have put another series on the disc like the complete X force or Exiles or something just to fill it out more.Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics.
