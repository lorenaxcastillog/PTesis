 With individual images from a photo library costing about as much as this whole collection, it's great value. I'm a beginner in the design business, and was encouraged by Robin Williams' design books to acquire resources. Art Explosion is certainly a great way to go. The large collection of fonts was an unexpected bonus. Only last night my son was looking for photos of fruit for a project he's working on, and Art Explosion came up with hundreds. I'm working images into various items that I write and the huge variety means I can find something to match the other elements. I did have a problem initially with a mislabelled disk. However an email to customer support and a replacement is on the way. A better search would be nice but I'm aware of the enormous task of tagging a collection this big, with no doubt a huge increase in cost. As it is I browse it with an ordinary file browser (which I actually find easier than the inbuilt catalogues) or search with a desktop search engine. Overall it's a great product
