 I interviewed for a job and notice the office was Mac dominated. I had always been reluctant to go with a mac so once I got offered the job I ordered this dvd to as to not be a total Mac dumb-donkey. I watched the first few lessons and I was set, my first day of work went well thanks to the DVD. The quality is the best and Tod the presenter is a gifted teacher, good voice, excellent overall. thanks To
