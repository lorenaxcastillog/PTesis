 I am a nurse who works a lot of overtime and has several income properties to supplement my income. I don't have a lot of time because I work a lot of overtime. Turbo Tax Primier made getting my entire withholding for both state and federal refunded to me far easier than if I'd taken all that paperwork to an accountant for the same task. The cost was a fraction of what the accountant would have charged, too. My returns are very complicated, but doing them with Turbo Tax Primier was definitely not. I've used it for 3 years and am extrememly happy with it
