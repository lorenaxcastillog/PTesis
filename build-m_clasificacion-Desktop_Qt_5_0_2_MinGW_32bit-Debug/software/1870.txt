 This is the second year I have used this product. I found it simple to follow and a great convenience since we were doing all our taxes manually before. It was even better this year since it automatically imported entries from last year saving me the time of re-inputing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to simplify the tax process! I had no problems with the install either
