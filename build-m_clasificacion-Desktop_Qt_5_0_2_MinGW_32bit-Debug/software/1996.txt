 I agree this is really dumb. What's the point? The original CD's may be backed up (thank God), so it's useless as an anti-theft device. I am a Mac user, and I have messed around with using disk images to replace the CD, but without success. Apparently they only permit direct hardware calls to the CD drive. May check with some gurus to see if there is a workaround. Basically a good product, but with just enough dumb, annoying flaws (and over priced) to prevent five stars
