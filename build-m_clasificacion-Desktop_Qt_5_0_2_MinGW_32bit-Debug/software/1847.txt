 I've been using graphics apps since they were invented and I remember well who has been the first to invent new features in the major drawing apps. In the old days illustrator had almost no market share because, well lets just say it had no market share. it is in my humble opinion the most difficult program to learn and to use I have ever seen. Freehand by contrast was adroit, thus it had all the market share on the mac platform and has for instants always been united press internationals world standard. with the release of version 7 of freehand macromedia announced that in order to reduce the apps growing tool set they would now build controls into objects. perhaps this is why some neophyte reviewers think coreldraw is a knockoff of freehand but in point of fact this was corels original innovation in version one of corel draw many many years before freehand copied it. Some of illustrators newest features like the ability to add spot colors to a bitmap were in version 3 or earlier of the corel package. Draw was the first program to offer true transparent vector objects, gradient transparency of vector or raster objects, interactive controls and draws vector lens effects are simply incomparable. The list could go on for days. Corel Draw today is by far the most capable app in the world. It's feature set is unapproached by illustrator. It's output to any device is always flawless and for my money it's lightyears ahead
