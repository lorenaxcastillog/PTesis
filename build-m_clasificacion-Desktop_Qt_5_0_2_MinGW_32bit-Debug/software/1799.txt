 This DV editing software is one of the best in the industry. While if you one version 1.x or 2.x who really are missing out on this new version. If you do NOT run OS X you should think twice about buying this product. However OSX users should definatly buy it because it adds native support. Also if you do not own a G4 also don't consider it because it is truley optimized for the G4 and will not preform well on a G3
