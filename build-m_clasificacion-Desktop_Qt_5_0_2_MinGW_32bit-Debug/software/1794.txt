 I was getting stressed out on how behind I was on scrapbooking- so I researched scrapbooking software. Ulead's Scrapbook 2 program was rated as an affordable, but good option, so I bought a copy on ebay for 21 cents. No big investment, just wanted to try it. It was a more stripped down version of the program, with 350 clip art items, and 100 pre-made pages, instead of the regular hundreds or thousands (I'm not sure), but that was fine, because I paid 21 cents, right? It was, in my opinion, hard to use, but I did like the possibilities of digital scrapbooking. So I went on the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer, and bought the Broderbund program. LOVE IT!!!! I've kicked out 10 or so pages tonight that look better than ANYTHING I've tried to make with paper and scissors. If you can use Printshop or Printmaster, you can easily master this program in a matter of minutes. Tons of scrapbook templates, tons of cute paper, tons of impressive effects. (I like the "torn" look around the photos, I always loved the look, but could never actually tear the paper to make the effect look halfway decent!) A very affordable, great program. Get it and get caught up! Let go of the guilt and burnout!!! You're still a woman, even if you can't cut paper:) Don't let your first kid have a huge scrapbook, your middle kid have a medium sized scrapbook, and your last kid have a box of unlabeled photographs....LO
