 I have been a huge champion of WordPerfect since it was written by Satellite Software Inc (SSI) about 200 years ago. I was forced into MS Word and it is not as good, but you get used to it. One caution, WP X3 does not handle PDFs at any useful level. Even simple PDFs had so many formatting problems, it was faster to re-create them by hand (which is not a fast thing).
