 After going through weeks with activation problems with Norton Anti-virus and then for them to tell me to get off dial up and go the high speed internet in order to get their product to work and still come up with the activation hang up, I then was referred to PC-Cillin. It was difficult to switch, because you get use to Norton, but now I am fine and my computer has been okay so far. It's recommended by most computer technicians..
