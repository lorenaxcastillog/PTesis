 I think that any paranormal investigators that deal with EVP's (Electronic Voice Phenomenon" can agree that this is probably the most important program that you can own. This is used to apply noise reduction, loop, slow-down, normalize, etc. when editing an EVP. Adobe if you are reading this review please oh god please someday release this product for the Mac. A great and certainly very powerful program
