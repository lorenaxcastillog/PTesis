 I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it. I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better. This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards. My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner. The reminders are wonderful. I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program. I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead. Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy. It should satisfy any user.
