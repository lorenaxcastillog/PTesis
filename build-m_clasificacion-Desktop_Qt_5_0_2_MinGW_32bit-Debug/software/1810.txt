 Interface, Schedule C and handing Partnerships and multiple State Returns was SO MUCH better than last year. I don't know why maneuvering around the Federal Return is so much easier than the interface for State returns. I had to visit the Turbotax forum to get pointers on restarting the state interviews. You really have to review the printed returns because the software kept deleting one of my large tax credits that I couldn't add except through the forms option and outside of the interview. It took a few whacks at the apple to get the entry to stay in the final calculation.
