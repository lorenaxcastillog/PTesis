 While not easy, this is a very good product for learning the French language. There is a variety of learning tasks that reinforces the learning experience. Although most of the learning options were useful, I found typing responses in French to be too awkward and time consuming to use without a French keyboard. The visual pictures would be more effective if images from France or the French speaking countries had been used.
