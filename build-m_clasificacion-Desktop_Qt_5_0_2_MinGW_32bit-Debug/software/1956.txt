 I've been using the beta for a while now, so I know that I like Office 2007. PowerPoint 2007 is especially exciting and new; Word and Excel don't seem that different to me. However, I just bought the full version and I COULDN'T OPEN IT! I felt stupid until I found out that I wasn't alone. Even with instructions that I found on the Web, I had to call Microsoft. There's a transparent label over the top that you need to remove before you can pull the red tab to open the box, but you can't remove the label without tearing the Certificate of Authenticity on top (which I might want if I ever sold it). In the end, I had to take the point of a scissors and squeeze it between the cracks on either side to slit the sides open. Next, I put the CD in the drive and nothing happened. I've never knowingly turned off autorun (this is a Vista machine). I had to go into Windows Explorer and double-click setup.exe. Finally, there are two disks, but no clue anywhere that I can find what the second one is for or what it contains. The installation instructions only mention one disk. It was a frustrating beginning
