 It's the first time I used TaxCut after years of TurboTax. Didn't have any installation problems and even the data import from last year went fine. It's basically the same thing as TurboTax, but not as slick. I guess less computer-savvy users should go with TurboTax, because navigation and entries that are off the interview path are quite tough to figure out. Despite my overall preference for Intuit's product, how can you resist the difference in price including the e-file rebate and now the $10 special rebate for TaxCut?
