 Ratings relative to other racing games. No doubt if this is your thing you will like this game. It's not an arcade game like GTA or NFS but is intended and seems to succeed as simulation. Several help / assists make it easier for rookies. Extrordinarily difficult on maximum settings, but satisfying if you "dumb down" the competition a bit, otherwise the learning curve and intensity is extreme. On line play available but expect to contend with both obsessed and extremely skilled components as well as crash happy losers. I would consider this the most compelling and perhaps realistic racing simulation around. Fabulous 3D rendering really requires current high end hardware. Using with a MacBook Pro (XP on boot camp) it works really well. Hate to admit of how much time I've spent playing this. Way cheaper than running real race cars and a lot safer. Works great with the Logitech G25. Problems: Missing online code available from manufacturer via e-mail. Starforce copy protection is annoying (requires original disk in drive) but has not caused any problems that I am aware of
