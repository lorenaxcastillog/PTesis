 Take it easy, get comfortable, the lessons repeat themselves and after a few hours you are amazed at how much you retain. Was sceptical at first, but the next afternoon when I was telling a friend which words I had learned, we were shocked at how much I had retained . It's easy, it's repetative, it's making me wish I had oredered all 3 levels at once. My oldest child is now takng spanish in high school, so I will order her all 3 levels. We can let her sisters use it to get a jump on spanish as well.They start spanish class in two years. This has been a good investment, as a contractor overseas working, it has paid off for the price paid and the time spent learning. Shows respect for others when you can learn their language to communicate with them.
