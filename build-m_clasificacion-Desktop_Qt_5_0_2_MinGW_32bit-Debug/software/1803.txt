 This is the NLT Life App Study Bible in Camel/Camel Leatherlike. First of all, the colour of this Bible is fantastic---actual eye candy for me, so out of all the other Life App Bibles, this one drew me. I like these colourful Leatherlike editions, and they were made in South Korea, which means that the bindings are sewn, and will last. The ribbon-marker is a decent length. The translation is very, very well done, and professional. Now, remember, this is not a 'literal', or 'Formal Equivalent' translation. It is 'Dynamic Equivalence' or, it translates the thoughts of the Biblical writers. With that in mind, the New Living Translation is a re-do of Ken Taylor's Living Bible Paraphrased, which, in my mind, was the most exciting and riveting Bible there was. The NLT is much tighter, and can be used for study. The notes are superb, as well as the character studies, which inform very well about different Biblical personages. The only thing I do not like about this Bible is the red-letter text in the New Testament. It almost makes the red-letter verses seem more important than the others, which is not good. On a practical basis, it is very glaring. I wish Bible publishers would publish just the black-letter text. This Bible is also not a lightweight. It's a good 2400 pages. But, all in all, this is indeed an edition to have. And the NLT is a great, great read. No seventeenth-century English to have to translate. And the colour on this one is a knockout
