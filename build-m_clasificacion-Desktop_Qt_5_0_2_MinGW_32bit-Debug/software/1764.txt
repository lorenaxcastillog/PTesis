 WordPerfect is a wonderful word processor. I have used both Word and WordPerfect. It is much more intuitive than Word. The reveal code feature is worth its weight in gold. Unlike Word, user has complete control over all aspects of their document. Quattro Pro and Presentations are equally capable in office environment. Since it allows saving in MS Office formats it is very handy
