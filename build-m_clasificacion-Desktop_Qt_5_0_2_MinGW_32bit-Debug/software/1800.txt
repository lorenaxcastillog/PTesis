 I use this clip-art at work. The selection of art is great. We have several other clip-art collections but I mostly use this one because it is so simple to search for what you need. Some of the photographs that I have wanted to use for backgrounds have been too small to convert to 300 dpi, though. But other than that, I really like this clip-art.
