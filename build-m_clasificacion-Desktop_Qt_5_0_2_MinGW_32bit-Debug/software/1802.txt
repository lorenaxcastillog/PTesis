 I have used Tax Cut over the past few years, for my federal returns. Tax Cut does the job, and was relatively easy to use. I do not use the state programs as I can file on-line for my state, which is simpler and faster than using the option provided by Tax Cut. I think the high on-line filing fee ($15) is a bit much, since the process probably costs about 2 cents to execute, and a stamp and envelope is not much more costly. That said, filing method is a personal preference. Having to download a state return is pain in the rump for someone without a high speed internet connection, though it probably makes business sense for H&R to structure the process this way
