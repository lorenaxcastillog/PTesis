 R u board with PowerPoint? Business meeting seem to go no where! U think u have seen it all till u try KeyNote! Folks I landed a promotion thanks to KeyNote just last week! I had a major presentation for a major central monetary agency (dead serious types) and I can tell u that they have never seen anything like KeyNote! I have yet to try PAGES but Keynote is the best presentation tool out there. Takes a bit of getting used to since we (the business users) have been on PowerPoint like forever! The best part is after I finished my 57 page presentation it was exported flawlessly to PowerPoint (without the special cinematic effects of course) and PDF and QuickTime movie! You can also import from Powerpoint but u must use your styles carefully so u don't end up tweaking each slide in keynote. Next time I am starting my entire project in keynote. (it does a flawless job of exporting but importing needs some work) If u wana wow the crowd with simple and graceful presentations (like the one's Steve throws @ Mac Expo) You open your mind to Keynote! A must have. Other wow products BTW I have been using on my MacMini is Merlin (the best Project management software ever) Good Luck to al
