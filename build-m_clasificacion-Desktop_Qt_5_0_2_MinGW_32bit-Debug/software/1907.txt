 For me the upgrade was a great thing. There had always been things about Office XP that just didn't work right. After the software was loaded, indeed I had some configuration issues. It worked, but it wasn't slick. But Microsoft Help stepped in. The software support guy took control of my computer using net-meeting and looked at all the configuration issues. Turned out to be some conflicts with my virus protection (I've had these before, P.N.) and with some Microsoft add-ins. Point is, he made the conflicts go away. Microsoft "help" has been a sometime thing, in the past. Today, it rose to the top shelf. I am quite happy with Office 2003.
