 Ok- I know that a lot of people say that they have a lot of problems installing Windows XP. First of all- the way that XP Handles Drivers is very different from 95,98,ME, and 2000. Many drivers do not work with XP, so it is important to contact your hadware manufacturer(s) to make sure that it is compatible. Older hardeware (ESPECIALLY LAPTOPS) may not have drivers that are compatible with XP. However, if you are building a new PC... I highly reccomend Windows XP Professional. Home edition is okay for a lot of things. But when you get into home networking and other advanced tasks, XP Pro is the way to go. I have had 2000 on my computer before this... and I always had problems. As soon as I upgraded to XP Pro, all problems went away. I also just built another computer... and XP Professional Works seamlessly with it. I am 100% satisfied with XP Pro
