 We tried to just dive in and do our dream house, but it takes a little more time to get into it. But, once you do the tutorial, you can do almost anything. I bought the product so we could see what our dream home would take. We are almost too amateur for it. We probably didn't need to spend this much to be pleased, but it's worked great for us.
