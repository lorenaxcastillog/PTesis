 When I first began downloading this program I did not know how I should install it or how much memory it used. I phoned tech support and picked this poor young man's brains. He answered every question I asked patiently and politely. He even walked me through some basic tools in the program. I am impressed! The software has hundreds upon hundreds of pre-made scrapbook pages for photos to be inserted, a heap of quality graphics, and these cute balloons you can add text to!! This is so easy to use that after 1 hour of playing with this I had printed half a dozen scrapbook pages! PEOPLE.....THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT!!!
