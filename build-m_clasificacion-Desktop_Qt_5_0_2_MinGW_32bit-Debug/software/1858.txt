 First off, I gave it 4 stars because for windows users- 5 star product, but for mac users- 3 stars windows users- if you're still using windows, you are missing out on no more troubleshooting problems, great user interface and next gen features like spotlight, dashboard and of course the great iLife. Tiger is about two times better than vista ultimate, and combining that with the expensive price, tiger is 8 times better. Even though vista copies many of the features in tiger, they are far from being as productive and easy-to-use as tiger's (not to mention tons of bugs and problems). SO GET A MAC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! [...
