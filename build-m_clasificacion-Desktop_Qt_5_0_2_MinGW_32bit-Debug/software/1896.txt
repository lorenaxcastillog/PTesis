 I'd been vacillating between Money Small Business, Quicken Business, and then stumbled across QuickBooks Simple Start. I bought Quickbooks because I expect my small business to grow to need the more advanced versions. The install was simple, the set up equally easy, and using it a breeze. It does just what I needed, with the exception of allowing me to charge by the hour instead of the product (or maybe I haven't figured out how to do that yet... that's what cost it a star. If it can do that, bump this up to a five.) Clean, simple interface, easy to use. Thrilled I bought it, but paid twenty dollars more for it last week than it's listed for now. :( Aw, well. It's tax deductable..
