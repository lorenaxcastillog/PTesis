 Family Tree Maker V. 16 is still a major software purchase for the family tree enthuiist. Simple to use, many printable reports and family tree outlines. You are able to record and save all your data and it is uploadable to online-family tree site in the GEDCOM format. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so. A must buy
