 I just bought my 2nd copy of Outlook 2007. I really like the many more email color categories, and you can assign your own name tags to them too. Much easier to use, runs faster, better features. On the downside no documentation and MS online documentation is incomprehensible. I wound up spending an hour on the phone with MS support. If you are already running an earlier version of Office with Outlook, you must first go to add/remove programs and change office to make Outlook un-available. Then and only then put in the disk and install. Do it any other way and you will be very sorry, all kinds of error msgs. and even your previous version of Outlook will no longer work. And yes it does import your msgs. and settings from your previous version. I run XP
