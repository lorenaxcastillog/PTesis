 Am longtime user of Microsoft Office. I admit it was frustrating at first to use this new system, but have been delighted overall. Really cool new features (or least now accessible to me): Outlook as nice feature of a to-do bar with just the next few appointments coming up to right of monthly calendar view. To do file management like delete/rename in Word open menu, (as opposed to going to to file manager), the real time resizing and recoloring of text as mouse passes thru the color and dropdown menus (as oposed to choosing, see if it works, go back to the size menu, choose, see if it works etc.). Their rational in going to the ribbons was that too many features were never discovered for use, and I do feel that as a power user my power is enhanced as I go through the ribbions by clicking on tabs at the top. Bottom line, for someone really into the esthetics of software and who is patient, this upgrade is probably for you. Otherwise the previous version will do nicely. P.S. If you've not download the free Microsoft Desktop search program, run to rather than walk to is my recomendation. James Warner, Seattl
