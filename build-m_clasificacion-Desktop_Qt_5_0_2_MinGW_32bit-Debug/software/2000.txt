 I had a problem where my hard drive was failing and the manufacturer was sending a new blank hard drive. I could either spend the next few weeks trying to replace the system, programs, settings, and files, or I could ghost the entire hard drive. True Image was easy to download and install (1st try). It made a mirror image of my hard drive to my USB-connect external drive in about 45 minutes and then was able to verify the back-up. There was also an easy guide to make a start-up disk on CD. When the new drive arrived, I replaced it and then True Image took care of the rest. In about 2 hours I was up and running again and didn't miss a single thing.
