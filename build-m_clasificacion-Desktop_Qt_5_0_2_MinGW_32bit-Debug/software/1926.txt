 I bought this about 6 months ago when I bought my first mac and also my first computer.I don't know why they aren't selling more of these things .For me ,looking at a manual the size of a phonebook is about as interesting as stocking shelves in a supermarket.This DVD rom is 8 hours long and covers all the items in the contents very well.Perhaps with a manual you can get into more detail but for me this is the place to start at least.What I do is watch a section and then either take a few notes and go to a particular program or just go to a particular program itself.By the way I do own a couple of manuals for Appleworks but they just collect dust
