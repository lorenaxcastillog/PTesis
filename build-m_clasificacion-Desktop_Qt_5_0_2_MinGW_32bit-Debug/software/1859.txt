 I purchased a PowerBook last year, so I was forced to start using OSX. Up to that time, I was using OS 9.2 on my G4 tower. Within a month of using OSX on my notebook, I almost completely stopped using my desktop computer because its operating system was so outdated. Finally, I updated to OSX on the tower. Now I have two great computers to work from. OSX rocks
