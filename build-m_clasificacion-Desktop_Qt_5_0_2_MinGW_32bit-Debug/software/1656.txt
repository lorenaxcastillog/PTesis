 I recently bought this version of Windows XP on Amazon.com after the release of Apple's Boot Camp. I printed out the installation instructions and followed the meticulously after setting up my new Macintosh. I then installed this software, installed antivirus (and other software like Office, Publisher, Visio, SimCity), and I updated the Windows OS. Everything operates as well as on my old pc, except it runs A LOT FASTER. I have a mac with 1 gig ram, dual-core intel processor, and a mammoth harddrive (4 times bigger than my Compaq), and I can access the corporate intranet, LiveMeeting, and other apps with so much ease. When I am done, I reboot and I am back to my Mac. Give it a whirl. It is awesome
