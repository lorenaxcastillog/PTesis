 I bought this for my dad as an upgrade, since he used the old version of Quickbooks (2002) and his tax guy bailed on him and never returned to upgrade. So, my father had 2 computers, one that was a dinosaur (6 years old!)and one that he just bought 2 years ago (top of the line at the time). He never got around to installing a version of quickbooks to his new pc so he always used his old one. I got fed up with him and his poor excuse for a number-crunching machine and bought this product for him. I backed up his old quickbooks company file to a few floppy disks, installed the 2006 version on his new computer, and the update was a snap. All I had to do was go through a few menus on 2006 and it asked for the floppies. I threw them in one by one, and it not only transferred ALL of his company information and ALL of his thousands of customer invoices and estimates to the new computer, it also updated to files to 2006 all in one "swing of the bat". E Z install, E Z company data transfer, all of this was installed and transferred within an hour (would have went faster if his old PC didn't take 10 minutes to boot up)! And to think, that was my first time dealing with Quickbooks. Not to meantion, I found it easier to navigate through the menus in comparing to 2002. A significant improvement over 2002, undoubtedly
