 Excellent upgrade! Read all the problems other had, was concerned. Did a dual boot, kept XP just in case. One month latter no real issues. Upgraded from XP MCE, HP suppled all the driver updates. Cons: Learning where some options have been moved or hidden (they are still there). Did not like UAC, you can turn it off. I did for awhile, now I've left it on. A couple of freeze ups, only in the first days. Software - Upgraded NERO Pros: Faster start up - even with a complex system (3 hard drives) "Start Search" feature. "Voice Recognition" very good, there is a learning curve. "System Diagnostics" with a system tracking record. Also there is a VISTA compatible version of "Open Office" free download Have not used XP since (seems dated now). Congratulations Microsoft, job well done
