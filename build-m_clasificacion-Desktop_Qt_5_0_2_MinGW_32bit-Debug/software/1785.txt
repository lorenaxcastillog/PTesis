 OK, so I got some old comics but I never found number 79. I always wondered what happened in that one. I read 78 and 80 many years ago, but there was always holes in the story. Now I can find out exactly what happened without paying a small forture for a collectors item. I will never be able to afford all the different comics and bound reprint collections to own all of the "FF." Now for a relatively small amount of money, compared to the cost of every comic at it's original cover price, I own every individual comic and then some. Wow, unique. This is kind of different. It works as promised, so I can read any story I want. A story I own that is packed away in one of several boxes from my youth, or a new one that came out when comics were the last thing on my mind. I won't buy many of these collections. But having one presents the possibility to go through one title and see its history. Few people had this option until this product came out. Give it try. See what you think. It will take a lot longer to go through than a TV series that costs the same.
