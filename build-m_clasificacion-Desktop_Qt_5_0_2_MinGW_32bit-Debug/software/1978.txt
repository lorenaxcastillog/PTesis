 A lot of brain flexing while enjoying the program's great graphics. I give the makers of this game a thumbs up for coming up with it. My son's use of it has sharpened his learning skills - without him knowing it. He just enjoys the games and funny (and safe) animation. A parent or older sibling will have to be there to help them understand some concepts, but as soon as they learn the game at level 1, it's easy to jump to 2nd then the 3rd level. Then again, this will depend on the child's age, learning ability, and the time spent on the computer. An hour with a bit of relaxing in between would be suggested when working in front of the computer to rest the eyes.
