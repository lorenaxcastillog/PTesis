 I'm an advanced amateur photographer who takes photos mainly for my own pleasure but I've also sold some prints and I also do some paid assignments. Anyway, trying to calibrate my monitor to achieve accurate color has been a difficult, seemingly impossible, sometimes almost futile endeavor. I've used manual (eyeballing) software tools such as Adobe Gamma without any success. Adobe Gamma got me whole lot closer to my ideal of a perfect color match than my factory default unadjusted monitor, but it was still off... the colors were a little too warm and the gamma a bit too high. Then I decided to order a hardware calibration tool. Enter the Spyder2Express. This thing is amazing! It was very easy to install and set up. About 10 minutes later my monitor was perfectly calibrated! Now my prints match what I see on the screen with amazing precision. I should have ordered one of these things a while ago... it would have saved me tons of headache and wasted prints
