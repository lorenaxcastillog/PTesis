 Tried to install with previous Norton Systemworks and Norton Internest Security on system. Had all kinds of problems. Microsoft add/remove software method would leave tidbits of programs and foul up install. Finally went to Symantec site and found Norton Removal tool which completely removed all Norton programs. Install went smoothly then and Systemworks Premier is working quite well. (Had same problem installing 2007 Internet Security and installed it first, then found that you have to remove Internet Sec. before installing Systemworks!! Removed IS, installed Systemworks and then reinstalled IS, now all Norton programs working well.
