 I got iolo's message about 'save $20 on SM7' so I went for it. Bad move. SM7 downloaded ok, installed ok, ran ONCE ok, then I couldn't get it to open up again. Then, about 30 seconds later, my computer shut itself off. My computer was only 7 months old at the time. I tried all my computer tricks about uninstalling, manually deleting files, system restore. Forget it, I was licked...all the computer would do is bootup, then after running 60 seconds or so, shut down. I had to do F10 and choose DESTRUCTIVE RECOVERY. What a drag. After spending the next day and a half re-installing all my programs it was ok. I ran it that way for the next month and a half, then the computer got a bit slow and I put SM6 back in. SM6 is running fine. SM7 is junk
