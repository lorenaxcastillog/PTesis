 Just as promised, Stan Lee has reproduced the entire Fantastic Four collection published for the last 44 years. Theres no way I have been able to read all of the issues, but it is really easy to pick out the issues I wanted. Some of the comics scanned could have been in a little better condition, but at this late date most of those are sealed and graded by CGC. It would be nice to have a search engine to help find issues with particular characters as well. Overall, though, it is great to have all 500+ issues on one disk for a reasonable price.
