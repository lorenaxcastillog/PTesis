 This review might be alittle hard on the product but I wasnt impressed. Expecting something revolutionary instead the lessons were kind of like going though High School again with one big exception. They dont give you a writen translation of what every thing means. Rossetta Stone focuses on pictures and the actual sounding out of words spoken. In the program you are presented a picture and in Italian a narrator tells you what is going on or what the picture is. However what he is saying is not directly translated in written words. Its up to you to figure out what he is saying based on what you see in the pictures. So pretty much you are not sure at times which words spoken are verbs or nouns. They do their best to single out the verbs in which they give you multiple pictures of ppl performing the same actions. However still its up to you to figure that out. Other than that its a great program. It forces you to pronounce italian with an italian accent using the pictures you see. You are able to write italian sentences using the same technique (still no english translation). I chose a language I already knew to try the program out. If I was a true beginner...I might have a hard time learning this language and I would by far not be fluent in it. Thats for sure
