 Running Norton 2006 it took almost 30 seconds to open an Excel Worksheet on my 2002 Dell with 256 MB Ram runing Windows XP. I uninstalled Norton and installed Kaspersky. It now takes 3 seconds to open the same file!! It did take longer to initially scan my machine, so what? I can do it at 3 AM. The machine runs faster. The one feature that I have not yet gotten to work is where already scanned and unchanged files are not rescanned. That would reduce the scan time to minutes. Allowing me to scan the machine every day if I wanted to.
