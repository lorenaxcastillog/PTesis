 what it does is awesome, unfortunately i wasn't able to make it work with adobe premiere on my computer, so if i want to capture with it i'd have to use the included pinnacle software. the free software works and it's pretty intuitive, but it takes way longer to load than premiere (for me anyway) and doesn't do what premiere does. overall, great product, just needs more compatability
