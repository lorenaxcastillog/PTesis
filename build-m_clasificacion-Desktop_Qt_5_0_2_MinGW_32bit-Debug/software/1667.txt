 Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar)
