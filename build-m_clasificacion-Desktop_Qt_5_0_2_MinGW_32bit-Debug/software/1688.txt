 How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop. Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy. I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center. Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography. And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea. Aperture is completely non-destructive. The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master. There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software. Its a digital SLR's best friend
