 I used this application to design an addition to our house. It was very easy to use;it has an extensive library of furniture, window styles, flooring, etc. You can change the dimensions of whats in the library as well as colors, finishes, materials. It made it possible to view what the room would look like with our existing furniture and helped determine what size the room would have to be. I took my laptop and printouts to the architect and builder, and the room looks great!
