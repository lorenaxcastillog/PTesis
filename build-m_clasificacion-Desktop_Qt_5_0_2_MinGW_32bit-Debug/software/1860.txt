 I had the Hallmark card program on my last PC, and found it to be comprehensive then. The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2007 is full of professional-looking graphics, and is easy to use. However, I would have paid the price for this programme just for the Event reminder calendar! I have all the family birthdays, and various appointments entered into it, and each time I boot up, the reminder pops up on the screen. Brilliant
