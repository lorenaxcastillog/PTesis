 AutoRoute Europe, not surprisingly, is very similar to Microsoft Streets and Trips. It is easy to use, the maps are very legible, and it has many convenient features such as distance measuring and route marking (highlighting), trip planner, etc. It seems to lack some of the detail of Streets and Trips. For example, it could not find Via Martinuzzo in Reggello, Italy. I believe the street appears on the map, but is unnamed. However, this is minor. Most of what you would be looking for is available and easily found. (I had no problems finding streets in Germany, even in small towns like Wittingen.) All in all, a very good product
