 I don't like to find time to review stuff like this, though all the Vista bashing is making me sick, so I feel its needed. I received Vista for free, through my engineering department of my university. If your in college check your technology website. Most universities provide lots of free software. However this is one OS I would gladly pay for. I installed the 64-bit edition of Windows Vista about 3 days ago. I can honestly say, that I have not had one driver or program compatibility issue as of yet. Of course I verified all my drivers were available for the 64-bit edition before I installed vista. Vista is very, very stable. I have not had a single problem yet. The OS surpassed my expectations, which were kind of low from all the Vista-Bashing I have read. The OS looks absolutely beautiful. Despite higher system requirements I see no slow down in terms of speed. I absolutely love the sidebar, which allows me to view my stocks, news, and weather while my computer is connected to the internet. Everything looks better to me, from control panel to the start menu. NOT A SINGLE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM TO REPORT WITH THE 64-BIT EDITION.
