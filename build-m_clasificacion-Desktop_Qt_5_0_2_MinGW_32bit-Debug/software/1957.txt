 I do not understand people who do not have Antivirus, firewall, etc. software. I am not saying you have to have Trend Micro's but if you're researching products, I can tell you that Trend Micro's works very well. I used to use Norton religiously but had several viruses crop up undetected by Norton. I have now had trend micro for 2 years and when I first installed it, it picked up some viruses that Norton didn't even detect. The other difference I noticed right away was that the "footprint" on my system was extremely reduced. Norton was a monster, slowing down my system. Trend Micro works BETTER and does not hog resources. I feel that the level of protection is also very good, I have had NO major problems since I switched to Trend Micro (I repeat, NO problems). I shudder to think back to the problems I had with Norton
