 Microsoft Works sometimes gets a bad rap. If you never used it, you may not know that includes a database, spreadsheet, word processor, and more. What's even better, is that the spreadsheet and word processor are compatible with Microsoft Office. So you can save files so that they can be opened in Microsoft Office AND you can open files that someone else sent to you if they were created in MS Word or Excel. This is perfect for the work I do for the humane society that I volunteer for as well as planning my daughter's girl scout troops activities and camping trips
