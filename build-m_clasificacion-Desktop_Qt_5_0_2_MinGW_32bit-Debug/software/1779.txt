 My girl has always loved Mia and she loves knowing words in other languages, so Mia's Language adventure in a real winner in our home. I sat with her through parts of the game and was amazed at the depth of the educative activities. The story was fun and I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in second languages. Bravo
