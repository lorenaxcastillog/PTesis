 I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more. I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user.
