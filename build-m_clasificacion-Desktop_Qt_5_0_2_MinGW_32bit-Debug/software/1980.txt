 I love the product. I especially like being able to type text onto scanned pdf documents. Extremely helpful for filling in government or preset forms. I should have checked the nnumber of licenses with the upgrade (only 2). I use on my office, home and laptop computers. A single license is not available so I had to buy two full upgrades
