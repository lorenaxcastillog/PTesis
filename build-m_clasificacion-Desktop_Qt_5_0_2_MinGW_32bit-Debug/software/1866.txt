 This is a great way to enjoy comics of the past. I enjoyed reading them all. One thing that use to get on my nerves is you buy a comic and the story is never finished, and you may never read the ending of the story if you can't get the next issue. This was great because I could read each issue without wondering what happened they are all there for me to read. I hope they continue to put the most popular back issues on CD/DVD. It is just great
