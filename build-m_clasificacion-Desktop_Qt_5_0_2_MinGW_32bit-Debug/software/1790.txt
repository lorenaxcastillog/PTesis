 I have evaluated only the free version of Snapfire, which is pretty polished and seems to work ok for me (I didn't run into bugs), but runs pretty slow on my laptop. I find Picasa 2 and Adobe Photoshop Album to be more full featured. Both run better on my PC, and are easy to use. Picasa 2 is free, and I'm leaning that way. PC Magazine has a good set of reviews of these software packages, so that's a good place to look to learn more.
