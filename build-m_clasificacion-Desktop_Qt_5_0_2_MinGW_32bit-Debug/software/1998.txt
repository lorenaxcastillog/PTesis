 I found Taxcut to work very well and was easy to follow. It's hard to bet it at under 9 bucks! I didn't buy the state version because the Michigan state tax form is pretty much a no brainer to fill out since you get very few deductions and once you have your AGI all you have to do is calculate the tax due. I mainly needed a tax program that would figure out if any AMT was due. The IRS paperwork for the AMT is confusing to me and I wanted a program that would do the work for me. I saw some other posts about people having problems installing taxcut and having it lock up at 21%. On the Taxcut website they talk about not having a certain font package on your computer will cause the lock up. Therefore, I downloaded and installed the font package first. Then I installed Taxcut and away I went. I ran the update manager first which took some time at my painfully slow 28.8 connection, but got through it in about a half hour. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are too many commercials for H&R block services and the donations portion was weak because it limited the amount of donation spaces to log in your donations. Therefore, I had to group the donation which was a little bit of a pain and because it thought the donations needed a special form because it exceeded some limits. And for some reason it wanted to know if they donations were post 9/27. This became a slight problem with grouping the donations. On the positive side I did like the way it logged in any capital gains for stocks or mutual funds. All that said I was able to do my taxes on a Sunday afternoon rather than over the entire week.
