 Bought this usb gps just before christmas for my trips to Virginia and DC. Had to weigh it against a similar product from Garmin. But the price, usability track record of Microsoft and user reviews persuaded me towards this MS product. I must say, this is an excellent value for money. Not only does it it give unambiguous directions (voice), other feature like GPS trail help you determine HOW lost you are from the actual route. Also you can recalculate the route from your current position. The voice giudance in one or two instances was a bit slow, but I pretty much got adequate time to make the turns and merges in nearly all instances. Extremely useful during night driving when it becomes difficult to read street names. The maps are very detailed and some cool features like "Nearest Items" (gas statn, railways stn, bus terminals, restaurants, hotes, etc) impressed me very much. Since this plugs into your laptop, its is best suited for your navigator, although I did make long trip with the laptop on the front seat and just listening to the voice driving directions. But since it does not call out the street names but shows it on display, you would neeed to look at the screen which is ofcourse dangerous. It does say "Wrong Route" when you go ofcourse but you'd need to hit a button to relculate the route from your current position. All said, for less than $100 this stuff rocks !!
