 This is a great chess game. It comes with an animated tutorial and various games that teach young children how to move the chess pieces and also discusses beginning chess strategy. This is my second copy of the game the first one got scratch and I could no longer use it. In fact, the only bad thing I would say about the game is that it doesn't completely install on your computer. In order to play the game you have to insert the disc in your computer
