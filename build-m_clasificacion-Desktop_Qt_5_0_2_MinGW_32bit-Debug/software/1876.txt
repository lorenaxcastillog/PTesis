 I found GT Legends to be a very realistic game. Plenty of user controlled variables. Tracks, at least the ones I could get to, were well represented and realistic. While I found the graphics quality good, the overall presentation was somewhat plain. I would have expected a little more "punch" to the visual representation of the tracks. I was quit disappointed with the fact that so few tracks are available at the start. I am a firm believer that if I paid for the whole game I should have access to the whole game no matter what my skill level. This idea of having to find cheat codes to play the whole game is a bunch of bull. Finally, 3 CD'S is a hassle why not a DVD option.
