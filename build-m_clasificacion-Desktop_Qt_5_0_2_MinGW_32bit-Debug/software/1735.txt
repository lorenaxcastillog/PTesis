 Recently we are traveling a lot to London and surrounding areas on business and this map program is helping us find details quickly about areas we want to visit, travel to, and eat at. So far the only functionality that doesn't appear in AutoRoute that does in Streets and Trips that we would like to have seen is the ability to use the mouse to draw a box around and area and then enlarge it. This function is much more cumbersome in Autoroute. So far we have enjoyed this program and are making a great use of it
