 I received Rosetta Stone Spanish, Level 1 for Christmas and I love it! The interaction and learning activities are easy to use and help you to pick up the language very quickly. I make several trips into Hispanic countries on Mission with our church and this helps me learn the things I need to communicate on a better level.
