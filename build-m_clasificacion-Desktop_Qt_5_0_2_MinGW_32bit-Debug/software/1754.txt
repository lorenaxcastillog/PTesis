 Have used PE 2.0 in the past. Recently decided to rejoin the digital editing age. Chose this product after reviewing many products including Lightroom, Aperture, Capture, Photoshop Cs and decided this offered the simplest methods for home editing. Also purchsed Classroom in a Book from Adobe and am tutoring myself. So far, so happy
