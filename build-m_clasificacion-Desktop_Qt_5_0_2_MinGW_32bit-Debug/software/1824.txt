 If the "free" Ancestry.com subscription is a consideration in your decision to purchase Family Tree Maker, you might want to know there are strings attached. Even though the 9 months are free, Ancestry.com requires a credit card number along with your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. Why would they want that information unless they intend to automatically bill you and extend the subscription at the end of 9 months? No information is provided on how to to cancel the subscription at the end of the free period
