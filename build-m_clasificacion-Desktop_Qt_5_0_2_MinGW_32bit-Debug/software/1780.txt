 I've been using Norton products for over 10 years. Each year they get more complex and more bulky. However, once the product is configured properly it tends to run well, detects intrusions and can improve the health of just about any Windows based system. The online update process seems to work well. However if you change your hardware system configuration you may have to re-activate the product. The default (out-of-box) settings ALWAYS needs tweaking. The 2007 version is even more bloated than this version.
