 I recently purchased Omnipage 15 as I had some old articles I wanted to edit and archive. I had been told that Omnipage would do the job. It did not disappoint. It was fast, kept the format, and as a bonus had made the PDFs it created searchable. I got through my original project so quickly; I have been using it on other documents. It has done a great job. Even the ones that are poor quality have come out great. I highly recommend this program. It has been well worth the money
