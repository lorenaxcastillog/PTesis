 My 7 year old daughter loves playing with this typing instuctor game. It tracks her progress so we can see her accuracy and her speed in the days or weeks to come. It shows the child in an easy an accurate way finger placement. I think there is up to 11 games to play, but we haven't gotten that far yet. I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. Love it so far
