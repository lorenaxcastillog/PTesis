 4000 fonts? well, counting both truetype and postscript versions, so really 2000, then take out the extended, condensed, outline, and other versions of the same fonts and you are left with about 800 different fonts, now that includes an oblique version of almost every font, which I leave in because it's a little difficult to make them on the fly. Many of them have regular, bold, bold oblique, oblique families, and THE VARIANTS ARE NAMED RIGHT, so they are easy to weed out. The fonts themselves are smooth where they should be, and appear well constructed. I cannot speak about the font manager software because I'm on a Macintosh, and so cannot run it, but the fonts are well worth the money
