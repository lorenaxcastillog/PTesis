 I have two Dell All In One Printers that I tried to install with this new software. I could not get the 942 to work because there are no new drives that Microsoft or Dell has created and they will not be available until 6/07. I tried to install the 924, but was not initially succesful. I contacted Dell support and they told me that a new driver was available. I installed it, but was only able to print. I cannot scan, copy or fax. I contacted Dell support and they told me that this driver will only let you print. I would have to wait until a new driver was created and they told me that it would be sometime. I have talked to friends that have Lexmark and HP printers and they are having the same difficulty. If Mr. Gates and company want this product to work, they should have thought it out completely.
