 I recently left Corporate America and set up a consulting practice which required balancing my own books instead of relying on the Finance group. I looked over several offerings and decided I only needed to track billings and create invoices. QuickBooks Simple Start handles these tasks quite well in addition to providing useful reports on outstanding invoices, sales by customer and a host of other great cuts at the data. I do agree with other reviewers that expensing of business supplies is not that well done and I couldn't figure out a way to depreciate a computer and software that I bought for the business. On the positive side, it is very simple to use and given the limited transactions avialable pretty much forces you to do it right. Overall I would purchase this product again given it's low cost and ability to meet my basic needs of keeping the books for my small business
