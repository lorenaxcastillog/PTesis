 I have used a few remotes with my PVR system but none as quite as nice as this one. Most of the PC remotes I have used are either too large, clumsy or tiny and get lost easy. This remote fits well in your hand, weighs enough to feel comfortable and has a very nice layout. The large firefly button takes a bit to get used to. I have hit this button a lot by accident bringing to life an unwanted application. Once you get used to the large button being there you can avoid it. If you could change the function of this button to something useful like the application of your choice.. or perhaps the TV guide in SnapStream's Beyond TV product. On the plus side - Responsive long battery life built rugged Great fit for your hand small and compact without losing any functionality On the negative side - The big firefly button does not allow you to change its function to anything useful
