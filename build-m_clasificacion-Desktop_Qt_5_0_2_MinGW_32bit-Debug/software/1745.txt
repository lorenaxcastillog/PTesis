 I, too, used to complain about Norton's poor customer service and the awful inability to smoothly upgrade. That was until I tried two other major products at home and changed employers to one with another major Norton competitor (products included McAfee's AntiVirus, ComputerAssociates' eTrust, and a couple of well-rated free-ware packages). The bottom line is protection without getting in the way. According to numerous reviews, Norton provides excellent protection. In addition, it has the ability to exclude known safe directories and it stops protecting almost immediately when you realize that it's spending a lot of CPU cycles scanning a known good file and you ask it to stop -- for example, the eTrust menu allows you to tell it to stop, but it doesn't take effect until the next transaction, which is too late to speed up a lengthy, trustworthy transaction. Norton is easy and intuitive to configure, even in its significantly more complex Internet Security package. All of the products I've tried, including major ones, fail in one or all of these key attributes. Therefore, I'll put up with Norton's awful renewal process and weak customer service in order to have a product that does what it's designed to do and that is flexible enough to be reasonable about it. Since recent reviews reveal that no single product provides good coverage against spyware, I do supplement Norton's product with periodic scans for spyware using "AdAware" and "Pest Patrol", and I keep "Startup Inspector" installed and on guard
