 I've had NAV 2007 3 user for about 4 months now. No problems. I think the key is being aware of these comments and being careful to uninstall any previous versions of NAV before installing. It is also generally true when installing many types of security software that you have to be careful about running security software from other companies (like a firewall from ZoneAlarm, etc) with that software. I don't use any other, including a firewall, since I'm careful about my outgoing activity/programs I install and my router protects me from uninitiated incoming activity. I think a good antivirus program coupled with some good incoming firewall protection (hardware(NAT router) or software, preferably hardware) and common sense and caution on the user's part about what they download, install, and websites they go to, etc is all that's really needed for most people. A bunch of extra garbage usually only complicates your life in time, money, etc spent on your part usually without a great deal of added protection (this includes user propensities as well... like getting sick of your software firewall nagging you all the time and so not looking at alerts as critically anymore, etc). A bunch of concurrently running security software also tends to bog your system down and increase the risk of a system crash
