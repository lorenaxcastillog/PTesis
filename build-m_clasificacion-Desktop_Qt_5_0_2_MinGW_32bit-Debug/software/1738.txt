 I ran across an internet review of HCS 2007. The reviewer said that the rights had been sold in 2006 and that the new owners had pretty much trashed the user interface. I don't KNOW that for sure, but what I DO know is that the 2006 version is great, like that reviewer said it was. The interface is well organized, intuitive, clear, and just plain designed with common sense. I was printing a nice card in less than 3 minutes - no lie.... AND it runs ENTIRELY on your hard drive - no CD required. That alone easily recommends it
