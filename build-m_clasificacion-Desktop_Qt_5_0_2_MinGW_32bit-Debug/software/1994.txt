 no problems yet so far and with its better features, most definately worth it. for a few extra bucks very much worth the upgrade from vista home to home premium. go with this product if your looking for something with enhanced security and more applications. only problem is have a bigger harddrive because this does take up a lot of space. other than that, does a heck lot more than xp in some ways but not a whole lot of changes
