 I am an older guy who can remember these great cars from the 60's and the races they ran. This is a terrific game and great fun. It installed and ran without a hitch (except I had to call the company to get the online code - a real person answered the phone and sent me the code immediately - amazing customer service). I am very pleased with this game and can't believe you can get such a quality game for such a low price
