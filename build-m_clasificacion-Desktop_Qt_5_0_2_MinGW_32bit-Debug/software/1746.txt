 I'm an interior designer and have Interior Designer 7.0. It's easy to learn, but I already had used similar programs and I know CAD, but you don't need any cad experience to use this program. Materials render well, but the library of furniture and accessories is fairly limited. For example I was creating a game room for a client and only had one style of pool table to choose from and no accessory items such as pool sticks, balls or wall racks. I've figured out some workarounds such as using round millwork items and sinking them into the pool table to look like balls. Bed styles are also very limited. I've downloaded all their bonus furniture, but it's still lacking. The fabric options are also fairly limited, but be sure to scroll down past "fabric" to find the category "BH&G Fabric". For colors, scroll down past "colors" to Benjamin Moore or download the bonus Sherwin Williams colors. Also the best plants are in the "Xfrog" category. To save time set your render quality to low for fast renderings, then change it back to high to place your accessories. The program does a good job allowing you to import your own images and textures. To show an image on a TV screen, define it as a new texture in your custom library with width set to 0 (so it doesn't repeat the image). Overall I like the program I just need to figure out how to get more furniture and accessories
