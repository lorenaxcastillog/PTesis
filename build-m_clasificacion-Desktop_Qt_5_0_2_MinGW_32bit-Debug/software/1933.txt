 I have been using Quicken since 2000 for my family accounting and my LLC biz accounting also. I updated my Quicken from ver2004 to ver2007. Costco had a much better price than Amazon for this software. The update process went smoothly. The ver2007 has a lot more reporting capabilities than the ver2004. The on-line update seems to be either on-the-par or a little slower than the ver2004. I tried the MS money deluxe back in mid -2006, but I just don't like the interface design from MS Money. So far, 2 months after the updating, I haven't run into any problem. Overall, I am happy with the ver2007 Quicken.
