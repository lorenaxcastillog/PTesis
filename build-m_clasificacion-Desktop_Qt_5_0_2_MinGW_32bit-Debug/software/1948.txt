 I have been a Symantec customer for many years. Each year this product gets better and better. Has Norton Firewall, Norton Anti-Virus, automatic updates for viruses and worms, cleans up unneeded files, finds problems with your PC and fixes it for you. You can even roll back your system to a certain date if a problem occurs and return to the date before the problem started. That is great! I would not use any other product for this purpose.
