 I had been using Mac OS X 10.3 for a really long time, and it was running very slow since about 75 percent of my hard drive consists of iTunes stuff. I don't know how it happens but it does and i decided to upgrade to version 10.4 and it is definently worth it. The installation process doesn't take too long but it isn't two seconds either and once you get it all going, it keeps your mac exactly the same and it runs at a quicker speed which is great, and it has an added feature with things called Widgets which are great because they are very helpful in daily life, when you wake up, you can click the area for widgets and the time comes up along with the weather and a 6 day forecast and my favorite feature is the Flight Tracker feature because i do a lot of flying so now i don't have to log on to the airtran website, i can look at the widget and it gives me all the flight info, like being on time or delayed. So i say you have to get it, or miss out on the fun
