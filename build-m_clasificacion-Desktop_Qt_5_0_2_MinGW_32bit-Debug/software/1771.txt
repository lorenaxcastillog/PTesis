 Before I bought this product I noted with interest the negative reviews. For the record I don't work for Nero, and never have. I am s software programmer and small network admin who has a pretty fair knowledge of how software things work.

I guess others have had their bad experiences; I certainly don't know why. Oh, the reason I installed the downloaded version was that the package product notes suggested I do so for Windows Vista. I used the key with my retail package and then the product went from demo to full. I am pleased with what I have
