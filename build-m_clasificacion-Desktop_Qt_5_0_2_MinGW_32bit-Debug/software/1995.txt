 I'm a freelance writer and reviewer so I do quite a bit of typing. I've had carpal tunnel for years but it has gotten progressively worse. When I saw Dragon Naturally Speaking 8 at the store I thought I would give it a try, especially since it was very affordable. This is my first review done entirely by vocal dictation. (As I'm speaking, it's writing down my words IN this review box!) It took me less than an hour to get this program up and running, and the program responds remarkably fast. The accuracy on some words is sometimes hit and miss, though. For example for "hit and miss" in the previous sentence, it wrote "hidden menace". However, there is an Accuracy Tool included which checks audio settings, perform additional training (reading information into the microphone), add words from your documents to the vocabulary, and more. I haven't used this tool yet, though. As I said, I'm less than one hour into testing this and it's performing great! If you're used to speaking fast and loose you may have to adjust your speaking style when using this tool, enunciating very clearly. During the training session they recommend speaking like a news broadcast, for example. But you don't need to speak word for word very slowly...normal speech is fine. I find the headset comfortable and I'm amazed at the responsiveness of this tool. I expected it to take longer to learn and use. If you have a limited use of your hands or have carpal tunnel syndrome, I highly recommend Dragon Naturally Speaking 8. All it takes is installing the CD-ROM, plugging in the headset to the speakers and doing a vocal test to adjust microphone levels. I'm excited to use this product, which will no doubt make life easier for both me and my hands! I love it that I can use this tool for Word Documents, emails, and website use!
