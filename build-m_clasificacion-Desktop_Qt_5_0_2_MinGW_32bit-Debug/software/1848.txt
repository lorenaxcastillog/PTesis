 I received this as a gift and I am very impressed with the quality compared to other PC screen-saver aquariums I have seen. You may also see it used as a demo in stores that sell PCs. The fish are highly realistic in the way they move as well as the 3D graphics. Watching fish move in and out of the gently waving tentacles of a sea anemone is almost as fascinating as the real thing. There is also a FishCam mode from a fish POV. You can select different aquariums and then add one or more fish from a selection of about 40. The choice of aquarium effects the choice of fish. Additional fish can be purchased online. If you have an older PC this program may not work well for you. The requirements include "3D graphics acceleration and support for DirectX 8.1". Also, I have not found a way to display the aquarium across multiple monitors. It would be great to see fish swim from one monitor over to the other.
