 This new OS is interesting. There are some features that "get in the way" as I hate having to verify everything I just told the computer to do. However, it is a nice upgrade as far as security and speed goes. Keep in mind that the hardware requirements listed are minimum requirements and Vista will operate much better on a newer machine with a faster processor, more RAM and higher end video card. It is a much faster OS than XP, but the changes require some getting used to. I would recommend holding off on upgrading at this time as there are a lot of programs that will not run on Vista as yet and even some that do are having issues with MS updates causing problems. Roxio Media Suite 9 is Vista compliant, but Vista pops a warning and shuts down a driver on system boot that is related to the Roxio software. Rhapsody doesn't work properly with it
