 I had gotten tired of paying the continual price increases at Symantec so I searched for another partition maker. Finding Acronis I tried it and liked it. The only drawback that keeps me from giving it a 5 is that the instructions are a bit clunky - not clear in all cases. Other than that, it is an excellent value
