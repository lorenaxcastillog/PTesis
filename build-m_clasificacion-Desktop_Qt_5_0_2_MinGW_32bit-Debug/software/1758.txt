 I've actually downgraded from Final Cut HD because when I bought that software it didn't work with my computer and then Apple couldn't fix so I was out $300. I needed to buy another software package but didn't want to spend another $300 so I went with FC Express. Because I'm a student it only cost me $99. To tell you the truth it's not that much different than the full version of FC. Most people that use FC are doing features which I'm not doing, and other people use it for the title generator and sound editing. I have other softwares for that. If you are looking into upgrading from iMovie and want FC go with FC Express. It's cheaper and there is not much difference in the two. If you are taking a video course at a college or other schools, check out the student discount price, it's great.
