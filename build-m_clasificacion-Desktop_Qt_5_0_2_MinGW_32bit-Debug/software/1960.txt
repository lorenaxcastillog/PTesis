 This is a renewal of one great software for me. I boutht this software several years ago on the recommendation of Consumer's Report. It is still, in my opinion, the best virus protection available. I've tried both the other two big names and find this one much easier to use. Funny thing is it is cheaper to buy a new software package than to renew through PC-Cillin. I highly recommend this software and will use it until someone comes out with something this easy and good
