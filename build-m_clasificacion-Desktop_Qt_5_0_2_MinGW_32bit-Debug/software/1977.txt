 I'm not sure what software the other reviewer was using, but I've been using Office Accounting since the 2006 release and I love it. I upgraded my old 2006 file to 2007 with ease. I have been running it on a Core2 Duo machine with no issues. No crashing, etc. I used this software under Windows XP as well as Windows Vista Business. My only reason for the 4 stars is that the Online Banking features don't work like Microsoft Money does. My bank only allows Money/Quicken to connect directly, or I'm able to download an Excel sheet with my data. Office Accounting lists my bank, but tells me I need to download my data from my bank instead of it automatically doing it. I bit strange since Money handles this with no problem. Anyway, it's great software for the price..
