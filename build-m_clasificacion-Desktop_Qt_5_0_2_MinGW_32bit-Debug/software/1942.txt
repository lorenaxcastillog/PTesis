 It's not that Photoshop is so great at what it does, really. It's that everyone else's programs are so far behind it. Every release gets a little better. Even the cheaper Photoshop Elements release has the new Shadow/Highlight tool and several of the other great Photoshop feaures. I'd love to buy a photo editing program by someone else. There are plenty of things about Photoshop that occasionally annoy me. Color correction can be some kind of voodoo ritual, for instance. There's just nothing else out there worth considering as a replacement, though. So, uh...I guess I'm a loyal Adobe customer.
