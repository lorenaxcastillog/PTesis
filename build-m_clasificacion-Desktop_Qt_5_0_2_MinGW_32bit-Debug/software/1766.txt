 I would give this product a 5 star rating but it just came out and there are a few very small problems. I'm sure Microsoft will fix them in future updates. One problem: when trying to insert an image it freezes when going to the directory which holds the image, you can back out and continue without any problems. A work around is to drag and drop the image. I miss some of the features FrontPage has, like, photo gallery web components(counter, marquee etc.) But, you can cut and paste code from FrontPage to Expression web and they will work. So, don't get rid of the FrontPage 2003 you can us some of its features with Expression Web. Expression web is a world class product many more features than FrontPage (CSS, ASP.NET,XHTML etc). If you are a web designer like me you will see what I mean when you use this product. Not mentioned in the advertising Expression Web comes with a second DVD with several hours of instructional movies on applications using this product.
