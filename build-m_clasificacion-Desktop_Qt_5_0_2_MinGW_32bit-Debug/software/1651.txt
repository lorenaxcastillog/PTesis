 I am pleased with the product. I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it. All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it. Very easy. I bought it for my daughter, who is in college. I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too. I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer
