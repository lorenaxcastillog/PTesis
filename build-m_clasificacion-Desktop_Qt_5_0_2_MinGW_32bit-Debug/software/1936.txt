 I know that most people simply do not backup their systems. If they only knew how easy it was with a product like Norton Ghost. This product not only backs up your files, it actually takes a snapshot of your system. If your hard drive fails completely, you can boot off the CD and clone a new drive to the state it was when the last backup was done (actually called a recovery point). Trust me, it works. I have had a hard drive fail on me. Another great feature is that you can also easily restore individual files from a specific recovery point. Having previously used Norton Ghost 9.0 for backup, I was already a big fan. But, version 10.0 is well worth the upgrade. Improvements include having Norton Ghost manage the space used for backups, so you don't have to guess how many recovery points will fit on your backup drive. And the biggest improvement of all - you can mount a recovery point as a mapped drive and copy files from previous backups, just like it was any other mapped drive. I have not used the backup to CR-RW or DVD-RW, although the product supports it. I would highly recommend getting an extra internal hard drive or external USB hard drive dedicated for backup with Norton Ghost. I use this method and it works great
