 I bought this Photoshop Elements software to help boost my digital scrap booking hobby. Unfortunately, it is a bit over my head. Perhaps if you are already familiar with Adobe Photoshop, then this software would be a cinch. But, for me, it isn't. I have spent more time trying to figure out how to use the Elements software versus having actually used it. If you are trying digital scrap booking for the first time, I recommend buying Scrapbook Factory Delux 3.0 version for less than 1/2 the cost of Photoshop Elements
