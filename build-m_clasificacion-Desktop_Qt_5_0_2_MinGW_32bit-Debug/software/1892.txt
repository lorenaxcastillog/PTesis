 I have recently become more serious about web page design. I looked at other products and tried them out. However, Dreamweaver has exceeded my expectations. I am not an advanced user by any means, so my rating might have a "new user bias" to it. My first web site used a WYSIWYG editor similar to Frontpage. Then, I downloaded the 30 day trial of Dreamweaver and redesigned the site. Productivity greatly increased and the interface is very easy to navigate, once you get used to it. The new web site is by far more impressive, user friendly, and feature rich without a cut in productivity. Learning Dreamweaver is a pleasure. If you are familiar with web design, the learning curve is very nice. I was making web pages within a couple of hours of downloading the trial. Tutorials are readily available in the Help menu and on the Adobe web site. Of course, you can always find a good book here on Amazon. If the price of Dreamweaver can fit your budget and you are serious about making impressive web sites, I highly recommend the consideration
