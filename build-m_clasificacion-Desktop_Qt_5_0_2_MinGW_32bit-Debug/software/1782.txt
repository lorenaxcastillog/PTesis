 I ordered this product as a result of a recommendation from a nationally known artist, who uses this software to assist her in composing ideas for her paintings. One of the features I most appreciate is the ability to straighten out pictures that were taken at an odd angle. The software is very easy to use and intuitive. I would recommend it
