 44 years of the fantastic four, for 40 bucks. incredible. it's easy to manipulate the comics with the reader, and they are extremely easy to see. a subscription (which is still a great deal) to ff now through marvel costs about 23 bucks a year, but here you can get 44 years of the greatest team in comics for less than the cost of 2 years worth of subscriptions. amazing. imagine how much it'd cost if you just collected trades of the great lee/kirby or byrne storylines. but instead you can get 44 years plus annuals just for 40 bucks. crazy. fantastic. this is probably the single greatest ff collectible out there, outside of owning the original comics.
