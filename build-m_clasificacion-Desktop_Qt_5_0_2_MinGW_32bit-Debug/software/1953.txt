 I bought the full biz version and at first I just did the upgrade from XP which didn't turn out so good and the upgrade does not work correctly but then I did a fresh install and WOW!!! This OS rocks, not only is it similar to the Mac OS but for the first time it runs smooth. I installed iTunes and even the video runs smoothly with no delay. Also the new Vista mail is ten times better at catching spam and alerting you of fruad fishing mail with also a linked calendar built right in to the system that can alert you of events when the program is not even running. A+++ on this one MS, it can only get better from here... Thanks for such a great OS..
