 Time and time again this program has allowed me to create wonderful VCDs for all my life's important events. Now at every important large family event a slide show is expected. A slide show was played at my grandparents wedding anniversary, the family reunion, and Christmas 2005 & 2006. Everybody enjoys watching them and I truly enjoy creating them. The first time I tried to create a VCD I was confused on exactly what I needed to do. I wondered to myself "what are PAL and NTSC settings, and what in the heck a SVCD is?" I was not at all experienced with video technology. I phoned technical support with these questions and many more. The representative was more then helpful; he basically held my hand through the first VCD creation. Then he patiently and professionally let me "pick his brain". I am now an expert in video creation. I even bought a DVD player that supports PAL and NTSC so that I can swap videos with my uncle in England. This program was diffidently worth its weight in gold! At this moment I am expecting the new version 2 to arrive and provide hours of entertainment for myself and my family.
