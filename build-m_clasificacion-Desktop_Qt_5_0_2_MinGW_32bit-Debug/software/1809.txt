 This product has met our needs ver well every year we've used it. We used the online only version last year, and it was slow and clunky (we couldn't pick up right where we'd left off). BUT... The desktop version is great! Faster than ever compared to earlier years, and no tax category was overlooked for personal or business. We ran it on Mac OS X 10.4.9. Buy with confidence
