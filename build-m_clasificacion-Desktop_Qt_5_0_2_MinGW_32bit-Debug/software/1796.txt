 I have a Mac at home and the DVD Rom had difficulties with my Mac. I'm on OSX and when I tried to read the PDF file, there was a transparent MARVEL logo across the center of every page that was annoying. When I tried to move onto the next issue, it would be missing and I would have to reload and start the disc again. When I took it to work and put it in my PC at my desk, it worked great, no transparency and a better presentation of menus for usage overall, so I guess I'll be reading this at work when I have time..
