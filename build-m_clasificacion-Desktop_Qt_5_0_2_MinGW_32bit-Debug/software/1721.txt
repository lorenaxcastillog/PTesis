 Having seen this product demonstrated at a recent photographic conference I purchased it as soon as I got home. When it arrived I immediately calibrated my PC monitor and Epson digital projector. The process is very simple with easy to follow screen prompts that walk you through the process. My images have been taken to a new level of color accuracy. This was the best investment I could have made to advance my photograpic color accuracy
