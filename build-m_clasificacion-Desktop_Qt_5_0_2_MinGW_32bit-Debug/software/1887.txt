 This software isn't actually your excellent version of notation software, but what I mean is this: There is nothing out there that you can get this cheaply that works this well. If you are composing for an orchestra, you will need to pay a few hundred dollars and get the real thing, because Finale SongWriter can't notate for orchestra, but if you are just trying to write down some basic music for your own enjoyment or if you are trying to make your band's music look more official, this is the software for you. As a kid, this is something that I can buy with my own money easily compared to the hundreds of dollars that I would have to save to get the real deal, and this provides about everything I need to write band songs or duets to do with friends. It's easy to use, and it does not require one to study the manual for hours to understand. Even friends of mine who do not know how to read music have had a fair amount of luck creating what they want on it
