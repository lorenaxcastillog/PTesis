 Mappoint is a great product but I don't understand why there aren't more city maps for Mexico included. This product is supposed to be for North America, to which Mexico belongs. Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and Mexico City were improved this time but it is very disappointing that the other major cities are still just shown as crossroads
