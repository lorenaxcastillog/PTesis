 If you love MS Paint but hate Photoshop don't buy this software. Cakewalk is not for people who want the software to do everything for them. This software replaced all my music gear and an old $250 version of Cakewalk. I now do not have to pull out my synth modules, drum machine, and digital recorder anymore. This does it all. I am totally blown away by what you get and the price you get it for. Yes, I am old school. I do actually create and modify the music. I do know what midi is and how it works. I did spend a little time learning the software. This software is not for wimps. It needs to be learned and it is not that difficult. The only thing I need to let you know that the internal synths do not sync with external but that was expected. There is a time lag between internal and external; realize that the computer has to do more math for the internal to work. No big deal. Just use the internal or nudge the track to make it sync.
