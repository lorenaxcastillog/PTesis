 I read reviews constantly, but my questions never seem to get answered. So I will try to answer the questions that I had about this item. First, It works really well. Second, it's easy. Third, for the price, this is probably the best you'll get. This item comes with the software to instantly burn DVDs. Plug this into your USB port after installing the software. Click on the Instant DVD Recorder, and use the advanced option. You get the whole menu on your screen, you pick what you want, and bam, your video is now recording right to disk. Quality? It's fine, you're going from tape to DVD, it will still be tape quality. Cautions: Make sure your computer/laptop isn't too old. This item NEEDS USB 2.0. Get an PMCIA adapter card if you're still running USB 1.1. Online auctions sell them cheaply.
