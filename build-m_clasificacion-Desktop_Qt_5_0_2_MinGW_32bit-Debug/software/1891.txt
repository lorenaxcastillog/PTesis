 This CD had so much useful information, and a great deal of it I had not even considered. Usually I can glean one or two things that I get from a book (CD) that makes it good and useful, this had many things I found useful. It was in a format that was easy to follow and I could skip over the parts that I did not find useful. Some sections were more geared for military personnel or foreign diplomats, but I guess I could use some of the strategies if I was traveling overseas? Some of it was also basic common sense, but if there was ever an emergency, it would be good to have it to refer to just to be sure we did not forget something. I also think some is more useful if we were already attacked as I would not use many of the strategies today. I kept waiting for the part where it would say buy lots of guns and hide cash and gold coins, but there was none of that. Overall, there are so many things in here that I had not thought about, and it was presented without a lot of fluff -- just the facts -- in an organized, easy, and comprehensice manner. I would highly recommend it for the entire family
