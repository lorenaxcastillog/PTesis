 GT Legends is a racing simulation that is based on the FIA GTC and TC leagues. What this means is that you get real world, present day tracks and old school autos to tear around them in. The graphics are very good and the sound is amazingly good on a decent sound system. The trck selection is very good and varied. The same can be said for the car selection. The game is heavy on the realism so if you are a fan of arcade racers it may not be for you. Though there is a career type mode where you have to run short championships to unlock tracks and earn money for new cars a la Gran Turismo. This system has been heavily criticized by sim enthusiasts but it gives the game a sense of purpose and truthfully its a lot of fun as well. If you don't like it you can search GT Legends forums for a fix that unlocks everything without having to do the championships. To play this game a steering wheel is a must. Although you can set it up for the keyboard or a controller neither does the game justice. Any steering wheel will do but I would recommend one with at least a shifter because it just doesn't feel right using panel shifters with these old cars, and frankly its alot of fun pumping the clutch and changing gears. If you have a force feed back wheel then you are in for a treat as it really adds to the game. The multiplayer component is easy to use although there doesn't seem to be alot of activity. Might have somthing to do with time zones as if you visit the GT Legends forums there are plenty of posts about online races. Just have to find a good group to race with I guess. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who really likes racing games
