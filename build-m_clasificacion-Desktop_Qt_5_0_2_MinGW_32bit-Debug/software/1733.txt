 I was an avid reader of Nancy Drew mysteries as a girl during the 50s and now as an old girl I get to revisit Nancy in another form. I enjoyed the game, was happy not to have to deal with an alarm clock this time. Just go up the stairs in the cabin a few clicks and you have the option to make it AM or PM. I got hopelessly lost in the forest in the beginning and the night sounds were spookily effective. I will admit I did resort to an outside tip after I put the sparkplugs in the wrong way in the outboard motor. Fatal error! It made me laugh, though. Love those second chances. This is the fourth Nancy Drew game I've played and I don't plan on stopping. The games are well put together and not just for kids. I find the puzzles to be challenging and the graphics and audio very well done. Keep 'em coming herinteractive
