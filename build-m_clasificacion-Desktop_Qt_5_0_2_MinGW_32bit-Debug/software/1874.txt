 I don't understand why people are having issues with the program unless they are not uninstalling all protective software first (anti-virus, anti-spyware, and Fire walls) Warning if you have Norton products download the free Norton removal program just search on Google (symnrt) download it and run it than all Norton products will be removed any that don't uninstall can be removed safely from the add remove program that windows has. Restart the pc and than install the program. do a full update using live update and restart after doing that the program should have no flaws. Now on to the pc i put it on to prove that yes it runs on slow and old systems. I have a laptop with a centrino processor running at 1.7 ghz 512 mb of ram 80 gig 5200 rpm hard drive and to test the capability while scanning i ran the cleanup wizard and the anti-virus scans at the same time while playing solitaire the system manager while these were going on didn't rise above 90% and the scanners changed speed to accommodate each other. As for my tech skills I work in a IT dept that services customers computers for a large retail and I feel confident on recommending this product for vista along with trend micro pccillin. Now to those who read the negative reviews and are getting vista do not buy McAfee because it is not certified for vista the only two anti virus companies that have received certification is Norton and Trend Micro because McAfee is not certified it is not guaranteed to protect your system. If you want to see a list of certified programs go to Microsofts website and search for vista compatibility and they have a list that they have certified and one that is compatible but might have issues use this site before buying security programs for Vist
