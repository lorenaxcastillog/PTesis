 I agree, Windows could improve thier products but I'm not going to jump on the Linux bandwagon just yet. You can get this product Academic for 84.00 on the web. I own several copies for my home computers. If you network and use wireless this is the program to use. I use both Unix and Windows at work and the Unix is far more stable. Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now and Linux is not user friendly. In the future Apple and Linux will have some of the same issues as Windows to deal with as they become more popular. Windows dominates for a reason. Also, when you upgrade select full install and not the upgrade. You will need a full version copy of Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000 to accomplish this. Registering your software with Microsoft is virtually painless, even if you need a new key. You can load Windows five times before your key expires. At that point you can call them for a new one. I'd buy this product again and Amazon is a great company to deal with- FIVE STARS to them!!
