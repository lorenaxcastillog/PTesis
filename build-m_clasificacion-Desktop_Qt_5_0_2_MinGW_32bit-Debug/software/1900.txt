 I've been using EazySpeak Spanish for about a week now and find it HIGHLY enjoyable and amusing. I do, however, have to agree with other reviews in that it is not for children. I was a little surprised at the semi-nudity of the characters and how, in one exercise, one bikini-clad female had semi-circles in her chest region to suggest nipples. Also, elsewhere in the program, one is introduced to the Spanish words for beer, rum, brandy, cigarettes, and various types of wine. All of these topics should be off-limits to a 12 year-old, which, the box claims, EazySpeak is suitable for. Overall, the program is fun. However, a parent should know beforehand that there are exercises such as "Help the Thief," which is a numbers game in which you assist a burglar in breaking into a safe. Also, there is an entire exercise dealing with drinks which takes place at a bar. Finally, there are the occasional moments spiced with "adult humor"... one such moment being a man kissing his wife goodnight while in bed, but fantasizing about a cute female at his job. Again, not child-appropriate, but all of this should be left to the discretion of the buyer.
