 I recently had a water problem that leaked on to my dining room ceiling. Knowing I would have to replace the ceiling, I took the opportunity to do some remodeling. I purchased the Punch Interior product. At first it was a little overwhelming, but after thumbing through the manual and reading some information on the Punch website I was able to quickly layout the the area of my room with the room designer. I was able to use the designers pallet to select the colors that I wanted to use and place on the walls. Even cooler than that I was able to select Sherwin-Williams paint. I walked right into the local store and matched the paint. It couldn't get much easier than that. There are also tutorials that you click on from the help menu that guide you in placing the materials. I was able to add some digital photos of some artwork as well on the wall. This has opened eyes to many other projects in my home. With a little effort the program is easily manueverable, but if you get stuck there are many ways to get through to the finished product.
