 Please don't expect to get the rebate. I was very disappointed in the rebate offer. I sent it in when I received the software. The rebate never came so I checked on it they told me how to fax it to them. Didn't hear anything after I did that. Everytime I tried to check on line it did not show again. So I started trying everyway I could to contact them. Finally, I got a response back to fax it again. Right away, I started contacting them with no answer until finally one day in January-I got two responses-"sorry this promotion is out of date now". This is after I felt I had to get nasty with them sending messages through the website to customer service that no one was answering me. So don't expect to see your rebate. They didn't care at all about the fact that it was sent to them and I started contacting them in time. I feel that it is a "come on". It is a good product-just don't lie to your customers.
