 First, after reading the reviews below, I noticed that only one person(Merrifield Winters) doesn't like this suite. Upon noticing that he is from Seattle(Microsoft's hometown), I decided to look at his other reviews. According to Mr. Winters, he purchases and extensively uses each version of WordPerfect Office, even after saying that each one is worthless. He also seems to have glowing complements for Microsoft products. This tends to make me think that Mr. Winters is a paid or voluntary basher. In my experience as a CPA, I have used both WordPerfect and MS Office on a day-to-day basis, both word processing and spreadsheets, and I have found that WordPerfect makes a product with many innovations that are then copied a year later by Microsoft Office. I guess they save a lot on R & D this way. Also, WP is much more intuitive for new users. I have had some clients that start on MS Office, only to give up due to its complexity and lack of explanations. I suggested WP to them, and they found that it was easy to follow. The only time that I will use MS Office is when I am supervising a client at their office, while I am complaining about it.
