 I'm a big fan of iWork and have always looked for new office apps that out-perform Microsoft's apps which have become so feature-rich that functionality has become akward. I love Pages and the formatting features it provides. I do more layout work than word processing so I'm real happy with the way Pages works for me. Keynote is nice too. I don't believe in lots of slide transitions and builds when making a presentation so a lot of the flash and panash that PowerPoint tries to interject is useless to me. You have lots of capability with Keynote but its clean, simple interface and robust formatting and import capabilities really works for me. Nice package to be sure! I would love to see a spreadsheet tool incorporated into iWork that is cross functional moreso than with Excel 2004 for Mac. I think that Appleworks is a great start but needs to be taken to the next level. Perhaps capture the spreadsheet piece from OpenOffice and build into a component of iWork and call it "Tabular" or "Sheets". (just a suggestion
