 I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about, but this program is only capable of going as far as your knowledge of the tools of the program. Quite honestly, Adobe Illustrator does not have as "steep" a learning curve as most people claim. With that, I HIGHLY recommend any beginner to get the Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann. (You will not regret it! I've tried the expensive "Total Training DVDs", which are more like "Concise Training") It has to be one of the BEST most thorough book to get you introduced into the program, and for about $20, is so much BETTER than what most college "intro" computer courses offer for $200-400. Now as for Illustrator CS2, most of the newest features have left me very satisfied with the upgrade. Especially the inclusion of "Live Trace" (eliminating the former "auto-trace" tool), with it's multiple tracing modes, makes converting bitmap images to vectors SO easy. Another feature I love is the top control palette, similar to that of Photoshop, which makes accessing options much easier. The only decision you might be faced with is whether these new features are worth the price of the upgrade (that is, unless your a student)
