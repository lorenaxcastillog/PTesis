 Once you decrypt the game entry point, Math Blaster is a brilliant method for teaching basic math functions (+,-,*, /). The problem with startup is the lack of guidance on how to start the game. A line or two (in the UI)explaining how to start the game (after the arithmetic tables are displayed) would be a tremendous assistance for beginners. We were disappointed with the list of +,-.*,/ tables displayed until we accidently clicked the entry point with the mouse. The user is presented an endless set of arithmetic expressions which the user must discern as valid/invalid while exploring a labyrinth of shoot-em-up and donkey-kong type choices. Perfect for a 6 year old 1st grade student
