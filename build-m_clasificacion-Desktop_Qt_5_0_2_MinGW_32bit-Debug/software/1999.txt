 I replaced my hard drive on my laptop. Acronis wrote the entire contents to a portable USB drive, and then moved it back to the new hard drive. I went from a failing 120GB drive with 60 GB used, to a USB 80GB drive, then back to a new 120GB drive. You need to have a CD drive to boot from. It was fairly intuitive to use... had to think about a couple of options, but got it right the first time I used it. It copied everything... programs, Windows, Desktop, E mails, favorites, even cookies. Acronis even lets you download a trial version for free with two weeks time limit. Their on line download price was more than I got it on Amazon, and I got the box and disk from Amazon. Gen
