 If you've only worked with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, you may be intimidated at first, but the end results speak for themselves. It is true that Final Cut Express HD isn't necessarily intuitive and the options are innumerable, but you will emerge from the other side of the learning curve amazed at how polished your works have become. You can update old iMovie projects easily; just import them into Express HD and add high quality titles and credits and an attractive soundtrack. If you want to take it further, you can experiment with an astounding variety of professional quality transitions, filters, and effects to deliver the full visual and auditory impact you desire. If you already have a previous release of Final Cut Express, the inclusion of LiveType and Soundtrack alone justify this upgrade. For a bonus, GarageBand musicians will love the hundreds of Apple loops included in the Soundtrack package
