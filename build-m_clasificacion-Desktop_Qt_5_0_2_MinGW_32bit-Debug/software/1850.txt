 Apple's iWork software presents two applications: Pages and Keynote which is Apple's answer to Microsoft's Publisher and Power Point. As someone who has used both, I can honestly say that iWork blows Publisher and Power Point clean out of the water. Keynote has some added features such as 3D graphs and the capaibility to add numbers in charts (like a very limited spread sheet) added in this version. You can make truly professional looking mind blowing presentations with Keynote that will make any presentation look like a multimedia jewel. Pages allows you to do desktop publishing and print media with the finesse and end results of professional looking print catalogs and brochures. Both applications are well designed and, just like all of the iLife apps, feature the classic Apple interface whereby all of your media content is available and intermeshed into the work flow. There is not really any new earth shattering features in 06 from the 05 version, but mainly just tweaks and enhancements. By far, the biggest disappointment is in the lack of upgrade pricing availability for users of the previous versions. You will have to pay full price even if you bought iWork '05. The family pack version for $99 is a really good buy as you get five licensed copies versus the single user copy which only gives you one installation for $79. The family pack is definitely the way to go especially if you need to install to more than one Mac. This is an excellent product that works really tight. I only give four stars for no upgrade pricing and for no new applications bundled with the package. If you need to do slide show presentations in front of a group, then the purchase price is worth the cost of Keynote alone. It really rocks
