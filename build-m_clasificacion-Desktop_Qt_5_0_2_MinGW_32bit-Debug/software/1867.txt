 This is a great set of cool old Marvel Comics, which, I think, is somewhat associated with Marvel editor Ralph Machio. The problem I have is that, some of the covers are not from the original comics. They're from the Marvel Masterworks Reprints editions. Spider-Man and The Avengers seem to include all of the original covers... but... The X-Men #s 1 though 7 look like heck (Not Don). They are missing all the very nice half-tone blends and toned grays that were apparent on all the early Marvel comics. The insides look pretty good. They've been photoshopped to make the borders and gutters white - which is fine, I guess. But I like the look of the yellowed cheap newsprint (inside the panels), because that's what old comics were made from... If you spend a lot of time perusing these gems... I'll bet you can almost smell the old paper and mildew
