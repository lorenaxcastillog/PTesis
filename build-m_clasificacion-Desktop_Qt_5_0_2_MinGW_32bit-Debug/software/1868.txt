 The future of Comics Collecting Ultimate X Men the Complete Comic Collection on CD ROM is available at Best Buy for $9.99 and it's a keeper if you love the new Ultimate X Men. When I would ask about comics on CD and DVD ROM I'd get these strange looks from clerks who'd say "who'd want to buy that?", but it's catching on as a new way to look at comics. It's the ideal format for preserving comics history. You won't feel guilt about selling your old comics and trade paperback books when you have this. I like them because you can install these on a laptop or any PC or MAC. Gone are the days of having an entire room to store your old comics. You can slab them and sell them (the paper versions) on E BAY because you can always read them forever on disc. GIT Corp was smart enough to include the annual in this edition. GIT, if your reading all future collections should include crossovers. That was the mistake of the Avengers and X Men DVD ROM comic collections. Without the crossover issues a fan can't read the entire story arc. One of the best aspects of the Ultimate series is the artwork. A lot of care was taken to show that these represent the next generation of X Men. We might be downloading new comics instead of purchasing them in a shop 5 years from now.
