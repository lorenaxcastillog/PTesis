 If you just need to type a few emails to friends or to make a little flyer for a party or something, just get a cheap program. But if you are a professional writer or want something that can do it all after you invest a little time learning your way around, buy the MS Office, Standard or Professional as your needs require. I bought the Mac version and love the way it looks on my big high def. 24" iMac, 2 pages wide. I am producing a book with it. If your IQ is below 50 it may be too much to handle. Otherwise, bite the bullit and get the features it offers. I also do training and seminars with Powerpoint and look forward to using the new additions added to this latest (2004) upgrade. P. S.: Ever notice how the people who write the majority of these reviews never should have passed any English class because they can't spell the most basic words in the language. And they expect us to give some credibility to their negative, "cry baby" reviews
