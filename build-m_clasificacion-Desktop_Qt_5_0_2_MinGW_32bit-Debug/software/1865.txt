 I love to scrapbook. When I am doing my own scrapbook I still have to go on to the computer and pick and print my pictures. With this program I do it all on the computer and get the same finished prodct. I work a couple of books together one with the computer and one with all my own supplies. Keeps my creative memories and stampin up products in use while I can put something together a little quicker when needed with this program. Have a blast with it ~ I do!
