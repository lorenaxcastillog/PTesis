 The Kid Pix software is a treasure...It is very user friendly and easy to learn. I especially like the templates that kids can choose the colors and fill in the pictures, as well as being able to draw freestyle. I used it for drawing cells, water cycles, atoms and labeling the digestive systems organs for a science class. It worked superbly because I have trouble drawing stick people so I could redo some things as often as needed until they were good enough to submit for grading. Thanks Learning Company, I would recommend this product to anyone needing a beginning art program
