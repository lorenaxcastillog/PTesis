 I've had several other digital editing programs and for the price, this is the best I've ever used. It's user-friendly with lots of special creative processes available. I especially love to cut and paste several pics into one by using the transparency feature to seamlessly meld them into a montage. As with any other program, practice and experimentation makes perfect! Don't be afraid to experiment on COPIES of your pics... never the originals! I do agree with the reviewer that said the red-eye needs improvement. It's just barely "OK" on most red-eyes, but is lousy correcting "glowing alien eyes!" When I bought this edition with the library feature, I wasn't sure I would use it since I had others which I thought were good. Wrong! It is fantastic! I'm sorry didn't buy it sooner. Overall, it's a 5-star product, but because of the red-eye/alien eye problem, I'm ranking it 4-stars. Even with that, I highly recommend it
