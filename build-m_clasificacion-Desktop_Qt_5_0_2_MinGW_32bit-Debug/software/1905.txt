 It seemed like it took forever to install this software. After properly uninstalling my previous software (norton) and all of its registry enteries, I began installation. My initial problem was that as I own 3 computers, and was running PC-Cillin one one of them, I had problems registering this software....even though this has its own serial number. It is rather amusing that as I purchased a multi pack...the registration process makes no allowance for those of us which own multiple computers. As of 2 days later I am still waiting for a fix. The rest of the installation was easy...it tiresome ( I live in a rural area and have to use dial-up). All was a smooth install except for the lack of error message, when line noise dropped connection (I did not figure this out until after I had performed my first scan and was informed I did not have the most recent version of anti-virals). Decent GUI interface, but clunky. I would rather the development money goes into the software anyway. IF you are a new user it might be more confusing...but the quick start guide is reasonably set out...once you figure out that the order on the quickstart guide is different than the order on the program interface. I am reminded of what Norton used to be like before it sold out to marketing companies/spyware/greyware providers without telling us consumers. I would recommned this to anyone. My only caution is to READ THE DIRECTIONS before jumping into the install. But shouldn't even experienced users do that? I just wish the quickstart guide checklist was in the same order as on the interface. I am confident because of my past experience that I can get the registration problem fixed...when someone who is a native english speaker reads my email to customer service. Dont bother calling the phone number, by the accents of the staff it just goes to a call center outside of the USA (probably in India)
