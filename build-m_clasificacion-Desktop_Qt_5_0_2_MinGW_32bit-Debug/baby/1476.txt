 As a first time mom I am very nervous about my son getting germs. He likes to lick everything. I got this product and it fit nicely on every cart I ecountered except the Costco cart. The cart was too big. I was still able to cover to seat and the handle preventing AJ from "tasting the cart". I also like the fact the it is easily washable and has its own safety strap. The minor problem I can't seem to fold it up without carefully thinking about it. Otherwise it stays in my trunk and out of the way unitl I need it
