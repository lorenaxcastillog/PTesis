 We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture
