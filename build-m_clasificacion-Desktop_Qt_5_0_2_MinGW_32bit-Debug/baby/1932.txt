 We bought this sleeper for our son to help with plagiocephaly at 5-months. Unfortunately, we didn't get this product soon enough. By the time we began to use it, our son was moving and flipping around in his crib more. It soon became more of a hazard since he would slide down and his head would end up between the sleep positioners. We had bought other sleep positioners to use when he was a newborn and wished that we had used this instead. The product itself is great. It's easy to wash and care for.
