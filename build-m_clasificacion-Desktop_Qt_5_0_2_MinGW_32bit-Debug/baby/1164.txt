 I have been using the Mei Hip since my son was 7 months old (for 5 months). I love Ella Roo products. I also have the Mei Tai. The key to comfort is to spread the strap across the shoulder so the weight is distributed. It makes running errands and work around the house so much easier. It positions your baby at the hip so you have more range of motion than if he was on your belly/chest as with other carriers. I fully recommend the mei hip. Though I would wait until your baby can hold his head up well as there is no head support so it is not for new babies.
