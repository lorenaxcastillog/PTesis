 I bought this for a friend who is expecting a second daughter, wanting the new baby to have something special too. Their first is about 20 months and I know she has sleeping issues, so anything to buy them extra sleep with #2 I thought would be appreciated! Well, here is the email we got from her husband yesterday: "[Baby #1] has gotten really attached to the sleep sheep you got for the baby-to-be. She has taken over ownership of it. [My wife] called me to tell me that [Baby #1] was freaking out, trying to find the sleep sheep, when she found it she hugged it and fell asleep. If this works, I will forever be indebted to you both... " So I'm adding it to our registry, expecting #1 of our own in September
