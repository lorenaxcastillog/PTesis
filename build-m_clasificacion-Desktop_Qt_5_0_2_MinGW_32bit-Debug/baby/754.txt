 Good things: (1) No interference. We live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs. (2) Connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement. I've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems. (3) You can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery. Only one bad thing--the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless. They are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband
