 I ordered two of these gates to block off spaces that are about nine feet long and these do the trick! These gates allow me to stop my baby from going up a staircase, down a staircase or out a door using all three panels which expand up to twelve feet. If you don't need all that length you can detach a panel or use it in a v-shape to angle it while using all three panels. I found it so easy to install just using two brackets on each wall. The screws and anchors provided were all I needed to install into drywall. Plus they give you a template to make it even easier to line up the screws. The gate swings open in either direction and is easy to open for an adult but I don't think my baby will figure it out for years to come. I am so happy that I invested in this gate rather than buying multiple gates to block all the stairs
