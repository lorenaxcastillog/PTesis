 This seat, along with the matching step stool are great! My daughter loves having her very own, special toilet seat and step for going potty. It has encouraged her to potty train, it fits the toilet seat nicely, and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself. I put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty, and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well.
