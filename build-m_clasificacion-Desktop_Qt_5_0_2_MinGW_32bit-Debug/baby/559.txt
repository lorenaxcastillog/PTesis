 I've had this seat for some time and I saw all of the negative reviews. It took a bit to figure out the quirks, but once I did, it was fine. The seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet, not the back or in the middle like mine at home. You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat. Otherwise it will fold, which is probably what happened to the other reviewer. It will slid off as you come off if you're not careful. My five year old uses it by herself and I use it with my 2 year old. It is so compact that I can stick it in my purse (I carry in in a zippy bag) and very easy to clean. There aren't too many of this type of product out there, but for me, it works just fine
