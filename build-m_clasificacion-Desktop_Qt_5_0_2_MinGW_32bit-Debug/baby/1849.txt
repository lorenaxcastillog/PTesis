 Okay first off I didn't get this from babiesrus because they wanted to charge an arm and leg to ship it. However I got a great deal on it at babysupermall.com , I ordered it the week of christmas and got it that same week. Shipping was free and thats great when you have to purchase something you can't see in person. I love it! Looks really adorable in a white crib. Very good quality and the colors on it would go great in a lavendar or pink room. We did our daughter's room in a dark pink at bottom with white chairrail, light pink above chairrail and white crown molding. Add in the wall decorations and other accessories and its tooooo cute. Go to the website I mentioned to find ALL accessories for this. Also you'll save in the pocketbook in shipping, especially if you want the whole collection
