 I really like how this step was designed to stay in place. We have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it. This one stays put! The only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top. It is a little difficult to clean. Since this is a potty step stool, it has gotten some messes on it that I wish would have been easier to get rid of
