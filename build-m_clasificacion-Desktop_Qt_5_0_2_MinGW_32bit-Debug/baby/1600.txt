 i hate having to wash bottles every night and these are a great time saver! Just throw out the liner and you only have to wash the nipples. Baby just loves them and so does hubby he does like to wash bottles either and he likes how once you push the air out baby can feed in any position as long as there is suction. i don't premix because you can't put them in the microwave but we have a bottle warmer so it works just as well. put the powder in the bottle first before the water or it won't mix as wel
