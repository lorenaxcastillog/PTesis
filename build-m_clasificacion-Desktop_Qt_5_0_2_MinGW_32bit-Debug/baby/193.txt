 I would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool. You don't have to clean #2 out of the cup and you'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink. It really saves a lot of hastle My mother-in-law and I both bought this potty for my daughter. (One for her house and one for mine.) It was hard for me to put together, my Mo-in-Law couldn't get it together at all. It makes a loud trumpet sound every time "water" passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first, but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died. The other thing I'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die, they are almost impossible to replace. In order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart, which again is very hard to put back together. We got ours on sale so I don't mind the expenditure. When you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops...
