 These breastshells helped me during pregnancy and post. During pregnancy they helped draw out my flat, and what I know now as small nipples. Post-pregnancy they helped relieve engorgement because they exert a small amount of pressure on the areola. This helped my baby latch on better b/c the breast wasn't soooo full. (I have a lot of milk). The shells catch milk really well, and if they are sterile you can even save the milk. The other great thing about these breastshells is that they prevent sore nipples from rubbing on your bra. I'd put a little lansinoh on my nipples, then the breastshells, then the bra. Just felt better. Only precaution: Make sure you put them on with the holes on the top or else you will be soaked, and they really can't be worn outside your home. They are obvious and unattractive
