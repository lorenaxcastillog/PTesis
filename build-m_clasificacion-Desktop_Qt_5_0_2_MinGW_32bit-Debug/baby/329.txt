 It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it. Now the bad! The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy. Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it. First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off. At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing. Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child
