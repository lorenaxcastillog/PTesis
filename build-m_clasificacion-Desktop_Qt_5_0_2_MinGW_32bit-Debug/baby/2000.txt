 This stroller was mentioned in Baby Talk magazine and that's why I looked into it as a replacement for my current umbrella stroller. It folds up just as compact as a regular umbrella stroller yet it offers so much more. The handle bars are cushioned and set higher up and out so your feet don't run into the wheels like other umbrella strollers. The seat reclines just enough that baby can snooze comfortably. My 11 month old daughter climbed right into it and fell asleep during our walk and slept for a while after. The cargo bags are great for holding keys, cell phone and snacks so you don't have to concern yourself with a diaper bag on quick trips. Even though the canopy isn't that large, it works well. You can position it so the sun stays out of baby's eyes. The wheels actually have suspension. When I would roll my old umbrella stroller down the sidewalk and I would hit a bump, my baby would just about get whiplash. But in the Kolcraft, we roll over the streets imperfections very smoothly. Plus, we love the color
