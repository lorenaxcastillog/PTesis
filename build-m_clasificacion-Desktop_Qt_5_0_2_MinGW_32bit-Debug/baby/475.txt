 ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course. Each baby is exceptional, in their own way. But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators? Well, I know one - MINE! I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant. One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm. It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid. I was about 7 months pregnant then. Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is. He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet. He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks. He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.). Yesterday he started reaching for objects. Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age. He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks. So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it. I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children. I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny
