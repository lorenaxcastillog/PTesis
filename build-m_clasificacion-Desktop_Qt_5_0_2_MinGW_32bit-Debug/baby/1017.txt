 My son is 13 months old and 25 pounds. One mother wrote that her 10 month old 24 pound baby could not fit in it, but my son fits into it fine with room to grow and he is even considered a &amp;quot;big baby&amp;quot;. I think that people need to take into consideration the height and weight proportion when buying the product. Every child is different, with different weight and height which means different shapes. Instead of my huge high chair in the kitchen, I now have a small booster that stays in one of the kitchen table seats and slides right under the table w/ the chair when my son is not in it. It is a great space saver.
