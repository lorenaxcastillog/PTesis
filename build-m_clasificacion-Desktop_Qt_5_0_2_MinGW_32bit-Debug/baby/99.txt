 Buy anything. Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result. I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible. I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother. I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!! So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying "HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls! I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains. This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online. I feel like throwing a party when it gets here. I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house.
