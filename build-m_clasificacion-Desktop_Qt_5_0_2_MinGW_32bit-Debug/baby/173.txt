 We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone.
