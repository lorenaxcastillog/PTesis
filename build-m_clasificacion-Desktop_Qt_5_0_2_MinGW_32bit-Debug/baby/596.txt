 I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!
