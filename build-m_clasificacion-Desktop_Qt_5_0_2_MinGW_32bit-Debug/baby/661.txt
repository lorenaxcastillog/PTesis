 we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews. I would have to say that it does work well. The only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom. Also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor. It has given me peace of mind that I don't have to run in every sound she makes. I can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me. I would recommend this product
