 My son is a 20 pound 6 month old. He was born with club feet and has a Dennis-Browne Bar between his feet. We can't put him in a shopping cart because he wears the brace all the time. We used to use a front carrier, but chunky butt got too big for it and it was a hassle to put him in by myself. I used the traditional sling with my other 3 kids, but couldn't use it for this little guy because of the brace. We just hook the hammock waist strap on, feed the rest between his legs, pull up and over my head, tighten and we're ready to go! I love it. I superglued some bathtub no-slips to the inside of the neck strap to keep from sliding. Works great. Highly recommend for anyone looking for nonconventional methods of transporting nonconventional kids
