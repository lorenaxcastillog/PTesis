 i love this crib set! i had a Snoopy set in the porta crib (i think it was recently discontinued) before i put in this one. it was cute but the bumper didn't fit too well (kinda awkward and uneven) and the quality of the fabrics used for the fitted sheet and the bumper felt cheap. i got the malawi porta crib set as a present (i added it into my registry because i liked the colors and i thought it looked cute). i was about to exchange it for store credit because i thought i had no use for it but i'm glad i didn't. the bumper fits almost perfectly and feels thicker and safer to use. i love the feel of the fabrics used for the whole set. it is definitely worth the money
