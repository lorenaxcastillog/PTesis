 We were originally going to get our 8 month old a jumper that you hang from the door. After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames, we firmly decided against that and researched floor models. We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base. The square Jumperoo didn't have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space. We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money. The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun! When we first put her in, she wasn't quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them. After she realized (in the first 2 minutes) that she could jump, she did with great joy. Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically. The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang. The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless, as does the color wheel. The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys. Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it. The box does not include the batteries and you'll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover. Also, the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you don't dry right away, well, they'll start to wrinkle. The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying/stowing but it's not a smooth transition. I don't see us doing it that often however. As I mentioned, the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially. And now, our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs. She doesn't seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older. Don't wait to get this, you won't regret it!
