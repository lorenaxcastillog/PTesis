 I did A TON of research on convertible infant-toddler car seats before my son outgrew his Graco SnugRide at 4 months. Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings (this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats!) I chose this seat because it has EPS side-impact protection under the carseat cover. It's worth the extra money because it's your child's life! Also, it's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps, and the cover is really silky and comfortable. My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway. My only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into the seat, but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports, not Britax. Also, the straps don't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son's neck. I just bought some soft terrycloth ones from Babies R Us for $4.99. It works
