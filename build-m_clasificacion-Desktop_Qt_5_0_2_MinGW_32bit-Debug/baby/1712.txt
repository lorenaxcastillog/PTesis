 ....and I would never have bought a second electric! All the other moms I know said get a Medela Pump in Style, but I thought if I could just *maybe* get a pump that took up 1/4" the space and made NO noise for $50, I'd try it. I'm not at all interested in trying another pump. I love having two, so I can keep one at work and one at home, or on weekends, when traveling, I can use one and then use the other, and both will be clean. I like the Avent bottles and nipples too. It took a series of complicated training sessions to show my husband how to properly assemble and use the Playtex Ventaire bottles, but the Avent bottles require a nipple, that's it! So easy
