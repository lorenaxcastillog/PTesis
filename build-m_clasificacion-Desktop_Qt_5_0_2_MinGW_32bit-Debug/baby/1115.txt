 This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it. She's mezmerized by the lights and movement and will cry when it turns off (she's still too little to reset herself). The characters are cute, the waterfall is very calming (even my husband and I stare at it), and the music and noises are very nice and relaxing. I do think it has a few areas of improvement. 1) The straps are really hard to get on. 2)The timer is way too short - I am always having to reset it for my daughter 3)It would be nice if it could be positioned higher. The instructions say 7" between soother and mattress is necessary which means that it has to go on the head of the crib instead of the side until my baby is old enough where I reposition the height of the mattress. So, unless she is positioned sideways she really doesn't get to see it well. I really do like this item and it has been a lifesaver getting our little one to fall asleep in the crib (she's 10 weeks old now and has been using this for a month). I highly recommend it
