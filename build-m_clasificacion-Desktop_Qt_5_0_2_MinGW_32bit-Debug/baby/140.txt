 I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months. In 2005, I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places. It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile, BUT... the trapdoors have broken TWICE. I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement. That free replacement broke less than 6 months later. You can't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken! This week, I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is $10. I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke. Unfortunately, it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so. I am an engineer and I don't know what to say, except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable. Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system, instead of relying on $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle! Now I have to decide whether to spend $10 on another replacement, try to fix it myself, get a different pail or maybe none of the above. At what point is enough, enough?
