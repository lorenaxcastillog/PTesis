 I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would. First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub. The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it? Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub. I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic. Don't waste your money. Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief
