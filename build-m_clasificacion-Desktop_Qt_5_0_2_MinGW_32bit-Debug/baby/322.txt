 I liked this tub at first. The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn. After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling. This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use. The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold. I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days. It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well. The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press. Especially when your hands are wet and slippery. It's a good thing BRU will take back anything! I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub
