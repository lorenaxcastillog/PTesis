 I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one. For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents: TRY THIS ONE IF... - You have a very abundant milk supply - You only plan to pump one or twice a month - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... - You're going back to work - Your milk supply is medium to low - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency) Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)
