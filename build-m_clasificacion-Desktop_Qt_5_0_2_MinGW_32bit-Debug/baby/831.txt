 I bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer, and he's used it once and tried to go in it several times, but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it. I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does "go" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary. The only problems I've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly (mostly when it was new), simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes, the fact that my three-year-old still can't quite get it that he can't sit on it and do #2, and the fact that it's just a little off-balance, so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall, you could have an icky mess. Luckily, ours has only fallen over when filled with water
