 My baby also has to have cereal thickened formula for his really bad reflux (as ordered by his doctor i might add). These nipples work great as long as the formula is too thick to use in a regular stage 1 or 2 nipple. The only problem i have found with these nipples is that you have to be gentle when you are using a nipple brush to clean them so that you don't tear the y-cut opening.....2 of our nipples tore at the cuts causing the hole to become larger. But gentler cleaning and checking the nipples before each use has remedied this problem. Also want to add that my son started using these nipples at the age of 2 months and has had no problems sucking from them.
