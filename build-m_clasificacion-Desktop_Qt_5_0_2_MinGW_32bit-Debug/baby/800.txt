 I have had great success with this manual pump. My best advice if you are having trouble is to TAKE OUT THE PETALS!!! This helped me immensely. Milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my I was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening. I took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective. I used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me. I highly recommend this pump
