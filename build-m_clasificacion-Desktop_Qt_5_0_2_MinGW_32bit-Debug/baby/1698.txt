 Triple Play Products are a joke of a company. They have no customer support, for example I needed to get a handle for my sit n stroll, it took 3 weeks of me calling nonstop for them to get aggravated enough to send me one. They also left a voice mail saying I was swearing and harassing them. First I never swear when talking to any kind of customer service even if it is a voice mail every time you call for three weeks straight. Second if by harassment they mean the first ten days that I called I was nice and the last 11 days I called I told them that their customer service is nonexistent and a joke and that the company had no business ethics what so ever, then guilty as charged. I also got in touch with Strolex the actual maker of the sit n stroll and tried to get parts thru them they gave me the Triple Play Products phone number. When I explained my problem with Triple Play to Strolex they didn't seem to be shocked, and even said other people have had the same problem with them. The product is great you can get one at [...]with the mesh bag and the sun cover and shipping. Great product I just hope you never have to replace parts, and if you do need to get parts plan on waiting 3 weeks for a response, and to be called a harassing customer because Triple Play Products has no clue what business ethics are
