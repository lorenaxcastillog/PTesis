 If you have a baby, you've gotta have a Regalo Portable High Chair. It is the most convenient item I've seen since strollers. It is very high quality in design and materials. The directions are a breeze. It washes easily, travels easily, looks nice and is just the perfect item if you are granny and live in a small apartment but want the grandbaby to eat with you often. The parents love it too because they take it to restaurants to avoid using the "contaminated" restaurant chairs. It is perfect for so many reasons. Get one today. You'll be glad you did
