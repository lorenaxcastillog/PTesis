 We purchased this to travel over the summer and it is great! I researched many options and, not only was this the most economical, it was the easiest and most efficient. It is very easy and quick to use and very small to store when not in use. Plus, my daughter loved it because it allowed her to travel in her own seat where she is very comfortable. Not only did we love it, I had three different people stop me in DFW and Denver international airports asking where I got it because they wanted one too
