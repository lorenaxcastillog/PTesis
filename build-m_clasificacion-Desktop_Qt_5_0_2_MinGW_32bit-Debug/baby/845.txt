 I heard about these blankets from a co-worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter. They are the softest blankets I've ever felt. There's a reason this company's name is CloudB! The only reason I gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing - the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges. Not a big deal, I just snipped them with a scissors, but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished.
