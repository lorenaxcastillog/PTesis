 We bought this walker for my son when he was about 8 months old. He immediately loved it and always wanted to be in it. This walker is so easy for him to turn corners and move all around the house in. It keeps him busy, and happy, for hours. The tray on the front is also great to put snacky-type foods for him to eat while he is in it as well as his sippy cup to drink from when he needs it. I would reccommend this walker to anyone with a baby, especially a baby that really wants to move
