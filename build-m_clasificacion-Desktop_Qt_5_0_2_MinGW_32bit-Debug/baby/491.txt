 I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the "pusher"). There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder. I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder. We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders. It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink. :-
