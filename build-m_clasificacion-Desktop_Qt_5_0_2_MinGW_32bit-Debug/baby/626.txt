 I recently purchased this monitor when my old Fisher Price 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year. I could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs. I figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim. Well... It works and I enjoy this monitor so much better that I am considering replacing my other Fisher Price one. With this monitor I do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise. My other one makes a low static sound all the time, it is not bother some but I can still hear it. I would highly recommend this model. The price is great and I have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that I can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries. A great find, a great buy, a great product
