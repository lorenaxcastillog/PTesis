 I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead. They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now. One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately. Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get. Another waste of money from Avent.
