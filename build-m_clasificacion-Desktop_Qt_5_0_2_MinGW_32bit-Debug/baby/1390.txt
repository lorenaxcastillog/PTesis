 I'm a mechanical engineer and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd have to pull out my tools to make this thing work on our Peg Perego P3 stroller. In fact, it went on quite easily. The key is to locate the clamps just below P3 logo on the brace that goes down toward the rear wheels. This allows the stroller to be folded up without removing the clamp - even if you have the large accessories like the snack tray or cup holder attached. I did have to slightly angle the cup holder out when the seat was reclined all the way back (because we snap in the car seat currently with our infant). I could not attach the clamps anywhere else on the stroller though due to the large oval tubing and necessity of folding it up. I'm impressed with the quality of the unit though. Do be sure to use the long bolts since the oval-shaped tubing makes it a little difficult to connect the two halves of the clamp. It would be even better if "ClicknGo" included bolts that were 1/4" longer so you wouldn't have to strain to pull the halves together.
