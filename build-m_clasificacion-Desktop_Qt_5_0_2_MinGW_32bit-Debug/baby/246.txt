 I hate, hate, hate this potty! The shield will not stay on. My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go". It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty. There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning. Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy
