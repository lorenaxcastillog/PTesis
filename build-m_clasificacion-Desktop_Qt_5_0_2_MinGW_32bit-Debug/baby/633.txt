 But, there are 2 things I don't like. One being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low. My sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old. Second being that the continuous play songs, don't actually continually play. It actually pauses for about 1-2 minutes. My son will fall asleep to the music, then it pauses and starts up again, waking him. i do love the vibration feature, which is the main reason i bought it. All in all, it is worth it
