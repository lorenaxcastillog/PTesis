 With the mixed reviews this gate has, I hesitated in buying it, but I wish I hadn't! My house is rather small but there is a large open area between the kitchen,living room,hallway, and door to basement; this is the highest traffic area in the house. Also, none of the walls or corners are straight across from each other making it impossible to use a more "traditional" gate. I actually found it easier not to attach this gate to the wall so I can change what part of the house I want my daughter to have access to. It is possible for the gate to tip over if my 2-year-old daughter is playing with it, so I made a rule that she is not allowed to "play" with the gate. It took her about a day to adjust but now she has no problem with it. I'm not sure about the durability of the gate since I have not had it long, but I think the price is well worth my daughter's safety and my peace of mind
