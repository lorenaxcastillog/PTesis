 This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice. I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste. I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything. Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers. Don't ask me how he did this. The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine. Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib
