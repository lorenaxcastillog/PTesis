 Just received this set and my wife and I love it! The construction is very solid but not too bulky for us. The micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture. The only two complains are: 1) The handle's height is not adjustable, which seems a bit too high to us (I am 5'6" BTW); and 2) it would be great to have a hand-break (i.e. wheel lock button on the handle) -- We previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not; it is the collapse/expand button instead. Despite these imperfection, we feel it much worth the $195 we paid for
