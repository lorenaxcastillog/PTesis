 I am a teacher, and I have very limited time and space in which to pump. These wipes have saved me- one wipe can clean all the accessories for the Medela double pump. There isn't a strong smell or nasty feel, either- as long as you can allow the pieces to sit and dry for at least 10 minutes, they are ready to go. Obviously, it isn't as good as getting to a sink, but in my situation they have been perfect. I would recommend having these on hand for an emergency even if you can usually wash your accessories every time
