 Experienced the original Diaper Genie with my baby niece about 2 years ago, was a royal pain this bottom to load with diapers and to change out the liners. And it seemed like the liner needed replacing every couple of days, probably due to the "twisting" sausage effect. I received this new Diaper Genie II as a gift for my newborn, and WOW. It is truly easy to load the liner, and I used it from last Wednesday through this Tuesday before needing to empty it. Emptying it was as easy as advertised, I slipped the liner through the cutter and tied off the top of the dirties and tied the bottom of the liner where we were starting over again. At first, it took two hands to un-snap the lid and get it open because it was new, now after a week it has been adequately broken in, and it truly is a one-handed operation. Even though baby is a newborn, she's been producing some MASSIVELY stinky diapers. Prior to receiving the Genie II, we were using a regular trashcan. The Genie II has completely contained the smell since it has been in use, and my nursery is now blessedly odorless! The liner situation is great. Diapers do not come in contact with the actual container which is extremely sanitary, LOVE IT! Also, it seems that you can safely stuff a LOT of diapers into each load which is great. Bottom line, I give my highest recommendation for this product, 5 stars PLUS!! This will be my signature shower gift to others from now on unless I get beaten to it
