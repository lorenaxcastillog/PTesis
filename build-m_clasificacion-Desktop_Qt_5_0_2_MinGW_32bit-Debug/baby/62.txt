 I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble. The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag." The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps. I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way. I recommend you avoid this product!
