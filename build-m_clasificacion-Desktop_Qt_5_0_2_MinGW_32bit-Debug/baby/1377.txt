 I Love it I Love it I Love it! My son is three and a half months old and quickly becomes bored and needs a new stimulus. This playmat is just the trick, I'm in heaven. When he tires of staring at the wide array of toys that are attached to the playard and playing with them he rolls over and pushes on the aqua part of the mat(his favorite part) then he rolls back over and stares at the lights and dancing fish on the detachable music box and happily laughs and kicks the cloth poles that hold the soft child safe and friendly toys above his head, he loves being able to control the movements of the toys above his head so much... and the cloth covered poles do not scare me as muc as the typical plastic ones, lastly he looks at himself in the mirror as he drifts off to sleep. He loves this mat and has finally given me some free time. The tummy time has doubled voluntarily since we recieved it in the mail. Defenitely worth the higher price! Also the biggest playmat of this type that I've found on the market will defenitely last me until far after we hit that crawling stage and then the detachable toys will still be usable. As will the mat for naptime. Thank you
