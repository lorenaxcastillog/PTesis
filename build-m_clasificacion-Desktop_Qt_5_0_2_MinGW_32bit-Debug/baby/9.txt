 WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub. My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!! The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part. Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar. OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it. Horrible product especially for baby boys.
