 The only reason that I did not give the gate a rating of 5 stars was due to price. I installed the gate in one of my bedroom door openings. It is nice and sturdy and it does close on its own. That was the key selling point to me. Not everyone remembers to close the gate behind themselves and that defeats the purpose of a gate in the first place. I do not want it to ever stand open on its own. I love the gate, I just wish that it was a little cheaper so I could install in into more of my door frames
