 I love how easy this stroller is to use, the way it looks, the way it handles and drives, and most importantly my son LOVES to ride in it! I say "nearly perfect" only because I wish it reclined. But this doesn't seem to prevent my son from having a pleasant nap in it....I just think he'd be more comfortable if it reclined. I'd keep everything else about it the same, and I would definitely recommend this stroller for someone who travels with her child as much as I do (once a month at least)
