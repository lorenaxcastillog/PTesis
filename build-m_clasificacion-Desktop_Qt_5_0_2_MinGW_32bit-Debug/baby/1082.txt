 We just received this today. It didn't take me too long to put it together by myself (hubby deployed). I had to secure my son in his sister's crib and couldn't find the proper screw driver but it can be put together with a common kitchen knife in about 45 minutes. The only problem I am having so far is the back keeps wanting to pop out as this is one of the snap in parts. My son, John, was so excited when he saw this and just loved playing in it the rest of the afternoon. He went to bed right away as he couldn't wait to get back in here.
