 I bought this for my first baby (now 2 1/2). He didn't like to spend much time in the Jumperoo and would only last a couple of minutes. I recently pulled it out and tried my 5 month in it. She was a bit fussy at first but now absolutely loves this. She jumps up and down for an hour, laughing and playing with the toys on the front. Any toy that can keep a 5 month old amused for more than a few minutes is wonderful and so I would definitely recommend it. I would have given it 5 stars but feel the gadgets on the front could be better
