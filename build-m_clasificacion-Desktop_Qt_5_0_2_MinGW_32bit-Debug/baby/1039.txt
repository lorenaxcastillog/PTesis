 These diapers hold in newborn poo - better than anything. After watching lots of friends wash their babies clothes everytime they pooped - because it leaked out of a disposable - I deciced to got with kissaluvs- and just change a diaper instead of a whole outfit!We used these for 2 months solid with proraps and bummis super whispher wrap ( my favorite). When have given a four - except - at 2 months my baby started to HATE having wetness next to her skin - at all - and it would wake her from her naps( could use a fleece liner and solve that problem) and they take FOREVER to dry - I'll hang them on the line all day and then still have to dry them for 20 mins.- Overall they are GREAT
