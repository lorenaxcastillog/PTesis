 We received the original co-sleeper as a gift. We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard. The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up. The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard. The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb. Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15. The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard. The width is 28" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31". There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy. (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens) This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual. I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly. Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out
