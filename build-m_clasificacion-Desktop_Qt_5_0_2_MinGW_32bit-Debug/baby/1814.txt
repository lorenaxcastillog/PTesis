 My daughter is breastfed, and we started her on 1 bottle a day of breastmilk when she was 3.5 weeks old. She started using the Playtex Ventair, and had no problems for over a month. Then, all of a sudden, she went on a bottle strike. We tried different bottles (Dr. Browns, Avent, cheapies) and different nipple flows - she wouldn't take any of them. When I found out that Soothie made bottles, I thought it was definately worth the try, since that was the only pacifier that she would take. She took the Soothie bottle instantly
