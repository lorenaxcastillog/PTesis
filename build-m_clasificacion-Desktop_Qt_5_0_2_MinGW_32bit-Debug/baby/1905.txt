 I love this pump.. I am a first time mom and wanted to breastfeed, but I work 3 nights a week and would need to express milk for my baby. I read all the reviews and wanted to try the ISIS since it isnt as pricey as the medela. I have had the best experience with this pump. One thing to note is that to get a comfortable &amp; good suction you have to get the cushion petal thing wet and leave it wet when you put it on the pump.. My baby is now 3 months old and still exclusively receiving breastmilk thanks to the ISIS
