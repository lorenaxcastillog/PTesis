 I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care. It has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other. The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house! I would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children. It will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along
