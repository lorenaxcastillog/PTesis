 I think for your money you get a great value for this playard. It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this. It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with. The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others. It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops. The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars
