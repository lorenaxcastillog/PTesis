 I purchased this bed online last year. It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora. However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up. The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. &#60;br /&#62; What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child
