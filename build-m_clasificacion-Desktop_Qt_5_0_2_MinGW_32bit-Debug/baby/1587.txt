 If there is one thing you are going to buy for your baby - buy this! Both my children went under it from newborn. The toys were fascinating for them to watch and the mat is nice and soft to lay on. As they grew they would bat the toys to make them swing and grab them to pull a leg or tail into their mouths for chewing. They learned to make the noises that each toy makes. The arches are soft and bendable so when they are rolling around they move with the baby so there is no risk of getting caught up in an odd position. It's portable, just folds in half, so you can take it with you. It washes up extremely well. It's just a great toy!
