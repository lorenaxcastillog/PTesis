 When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size. However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one. My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem! I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them. I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes
