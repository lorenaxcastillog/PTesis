 When my parents bought the base off our registry, they didn't understand why we'd need two bases for one car seat. "Can't you just move yours between cars? It's not like you'll be riding in our car that often" After we strapped the second base into their car, they hardly ever removed it and they relished the opportunities to pick up the baby on the spur of the moment. They were disappointed when the baby outgrew his Snugride seat and hoped I could find a similar base system for the next size of car seat. After watching me move his convertible seat back and forth a few times, they've decided to install a second larger seat in their car to avoid the hassle. The Snugrider was a far more cost & space-effective solution than 2 car seats, and since the base only has to be installed once, people less familiar with the car seat can still safely move the baby in and out of the car repeatedly with greatly lessened risk of error
