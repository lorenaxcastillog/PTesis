 I must say I am truely impressed...and that is not the usual for me...I popped it open and it just beamed at me...so it looks good. It fit on both versions of my babies strollers the full size and the light weight umbrella canopy stroller. The velcro straps let you adjust tightness of the fit and secure it to the handles and legs of the stroller!No more fly aways!!!. The only thing I could see making it not 100% full proof is the blue material that makes the roof...but even that repelled most of the water when I sprinkled it kind of like windbreaker jacket material....but doesnt the roof of your stroller get wet when it rains regardless?!Sure it does!If you dont want to get wet at all Stay Out of The Rain!With that said I must give this wonderful Product the Big Mommy Approval Stamp
