 I love this stroller! First of all, it comes in fun, non-gender specific colors, unlike so many baby items. Second, it is extremely lightweight and easy to unfold one-handed (even while holding a baby). Third, the proportions of the stroller are perfect! My husband and I test-drove many umbrella strollers and found that we usually kicked the wheels (he is 6 feet tall, while I am 5'6"), but we don't with the Maclaren. Also, the handles are tall enough that he is not hunched over pushing the stroller. There are a lot of other great features, too. There is a carry strap that is great for transporting the stroller. The mesh seat keeps baby cool in the summer, and we purchased the "Volo accessory pack" which has a solid, padded seat liner which we use in the winter to keep baby warm. I do recommend getting the accessory pack, which also has a rain cover and carry-bag for the stroller. The basket under the seat in on the small side (forget about fitting a diaper bag in there) but I don't mind carrying the diaper bag because the stroller is so lightweight and manuverable. My only other issue is that the sun canopy does not tilt very far forward. Overall, we are very satisfied with the Maclaren Volo
