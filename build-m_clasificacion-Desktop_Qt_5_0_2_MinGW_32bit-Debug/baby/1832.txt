 I started out with a different shopping cart cover that I bought at the grocery store. It worked ok, but it didn't work at all at Costco because the carts are extra wide. I bought the floppy seat and it works like a charm. It's the only one I've found that's wide enough for the Costco and Sam's Club carts. And, it's fluffy, comfy, and easy to use. Regarding the one reviewer's comment - yes, you do have to feed the strap through the back - but every shopping cart cover out there requires you to do that. I can't get it on with one hand, but it's big enough that I can put it in the seat, put my son in the seat, and then get it perfectly situated once he's sitting and strapped in. My only complaint is that it's pretty big, but if it were smaller it probably wouldn't fit the big carts - which is why I like it so much in the first place. Plus, it covers every inch so my very curious son can't find random shopping cart or highchair spots to suck
