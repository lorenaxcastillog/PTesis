 I received this play gym as a shower gift prior to my childs birth. I also received a larger more elaborate play gym at the same time. Because this gym is smaller and more portable I started placing my munchkin in it at 3 weeks to stimulate and entertain her. The bold black and white designs and primary colors are perfect for a newborn to attempt to focus on and there aren't a ton of hanging toys to overstimulate or startle her. It folds up easily for carrying around the house or packing in the car for a trip to Grammie's. You can even throw in a few extra toys when folded (it's like a large purse or carrying bag) and know that they won't fall out on the way. Now that baby is close to 2 months old and more playful the hanging toys are just the right height for her to bat at and she loves to gaze at herself and coo into the mirror. Overall I'm pleased with the gym and would reccomend it. I only gave it 4 stars because at times the overhead bar will tilt this way or that and you have to straighten it a bit to keep it upright
