 Our toddler recently moved into a "big boy" bed and was falling out of bed numerous times at night. We originally bought a single bed rail but found we needed a double sided bed rail because we can't have his bed against the wall because he kicks the wall and wakes us up throughout the night. I actually like the positioning of double rail better than the single because it clamps onto the bottom of the mattress rather than the top which leave more room on the bed. It's easy to change sheets because the rails drop down. The last part of assembling the sides with fabric (getting the screws in the correct place) was a little difficult, probably easier with two people but other than that, very easy to assemble. We are very pleased with this purchase
