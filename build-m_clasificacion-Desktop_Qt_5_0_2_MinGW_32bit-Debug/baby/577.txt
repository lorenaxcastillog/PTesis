 We started with Dr. Brown's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning. We've used them both for breastmilk and for formula, and they've been great for both. We've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes, and I give all the credit to the bottles. They're comfortable for me to hold, light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own, and easy to fill. The cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it's worth it. And we haven't found that Dr. Brown's leaks any more than any other brand. Definitely give these a try - they're great
