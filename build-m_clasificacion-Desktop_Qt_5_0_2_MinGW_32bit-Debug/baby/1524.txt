 This item is GREAT! I have a 5 month old and a 3 year old. I was looking for something to help protect the baby from the sun so we could still be out doing all the fun summer things with our 3 year old and this works great. I have used it with my single regular stroller, my umbrella stroller (it has a small canopy to attach to, and on the front portion of my sit n stand stroller. It has worked great with all three strollers in all weather conditions and it wraps up into a small carrying case! Think I am getting a double to attach to the rented theme park strollers for the rest of the summer
