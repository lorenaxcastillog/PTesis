 I was given this walker from a friend who's child progressed so fast he skipped the walker stage. When I brought it home my son instantally fell in love with it for the shear fact that he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it. It is a little basic in design and I have found that the toys do not stay put for very long they are not made very well and are very basic. My main problem with this walker is that it is a pain in the butt to put away it doesn't fold up easily and it doesn't stay folded for very long. I also am having problems ajusting the height of the walker my friend put it all the way down and now I can't get it to go back up so my son's is basically standing all by himself when he is in it (which I am not complaining about)
