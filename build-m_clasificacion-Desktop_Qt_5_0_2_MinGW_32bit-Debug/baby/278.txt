 I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors. The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery. And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it. I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out. There is tons of static and extra noise. Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much. Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!! Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend!
