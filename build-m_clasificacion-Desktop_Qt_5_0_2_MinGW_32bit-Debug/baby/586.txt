 I'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl. I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever.
