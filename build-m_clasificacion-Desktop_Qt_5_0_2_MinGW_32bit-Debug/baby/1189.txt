 when i had my oldest, i did not have this product. he often got upset when being changed which resulted in him crying. it always took a while to calm him down. i recieved this as a gift and was pleasently suprised. my wipes never turn brown or dry out as long as i use a thick wipe such as huggies wipes. my son's tooshie stays warm and it also wipes off easier. the result is having your child staying calm and happy. i do think it works a billion times better than holding it in your hand and who wants to hold them in your hand to warm when so often you need one right after another. i think it's not a luxery, but a necessity
