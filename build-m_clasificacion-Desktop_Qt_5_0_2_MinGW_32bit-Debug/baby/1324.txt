 I compared reviews on this mobile along with the TinyLove mobile called Symphony in Motion and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile. I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is. And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well. Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too. In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed. She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round. But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime. My husband and I are VERY pleased with this purchase
