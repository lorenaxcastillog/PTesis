 I bought this sling when I was still pregnant. After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet. When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this! I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful. First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby. I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again
