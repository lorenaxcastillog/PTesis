 I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit.
