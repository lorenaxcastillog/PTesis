 I bought the lil snuggler sleep nest for my 3 month old daughter who did not like sleeping in her crib. She had been sleeping in an infant chair but we were concerned about her safety. I bought this hoping the closeness of the sides would make her feel more comfortable, like the chair. It worked perfectly. She is now 4 months old and sleeps through the night in her sleep nest. I even was able to prop it up so that it has a slight incline which she loves. I highly recommend this product
