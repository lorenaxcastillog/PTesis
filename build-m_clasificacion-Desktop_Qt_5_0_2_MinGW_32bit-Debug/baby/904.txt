 My daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) likes this cot, a lot. I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M-I-L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib. She sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon, which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her (darkened) room. It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don't have to haul her port-a-crib. The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it, of course, but... it's a cot! She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time, so I figured I'd buy it for my M-I-L at home. It does the trick and my baby thinks it's special. I tell her that it's only for when Grandma S is over (b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time). Naturally, I'd prefer she take a longer nap, so I told her it's for special days only, when Grandma S is here. So now she uses it to "tuck in" her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night. I love it, and it seems comfortable, very portable and handy. I would recommend it. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip, but I wanted to review it now, in case you were wondering whether or not to get it. I think it's very much worth it, but everyone's different. It's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends. Also, it is very sturdy & supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all. Hope that helps
