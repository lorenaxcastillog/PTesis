 I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this
