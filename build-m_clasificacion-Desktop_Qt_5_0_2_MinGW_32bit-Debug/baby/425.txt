 I thought I would love this but just returned it. It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?) Maybe I'm too small (5'2")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large. Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable. I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing! Very painful
