 I have recently had my FIFTH child and so I have experienced many baby items, including swings, and this one is the BEST! It has a cushiony, comfy seat for baby with different recline options; soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at; several musical tunes with adjustable volume control. There is also a dial to set the swing motion -- to go slowly or faster -- and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side, or front to back. Sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back, and she'll cry -- we then change the swing position to go side to side, and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep. And vice versa, sometimes we put her in side to side, and she wants to swing front to back -- how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she's in the mood for! As my husband says, "this is the best money we've ever spent!
