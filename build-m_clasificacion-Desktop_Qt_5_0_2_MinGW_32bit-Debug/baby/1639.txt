 Okay, so the canopy. Well it was touching my sons head, however there is a natural bend in the metal that holds the canopy up (that slides through the canopy like a curtain rod)(where it connects to the stroller)and I took it out and put it though the other way and my son has like 2 inches between his head and the canopy. For the other people that had or will have this problem, this is an easy fix.I hope some people who already left reveiws will come back and read this. I give it 4 stars now instead of 3 on my other reveiw. My other reveiw is labeled kamarina
