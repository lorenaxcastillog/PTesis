 This was the only way we could get our newborn to do tummy time. Flat on his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head at all just freaked him out and he'd cry and cry. But with the little raised pillow, it would keep him from having his face smoshed into the floor and he'd be more patient with trying to look around. Now that he's 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn't really need the extra booster pillow, and he didn't start playing with the water bit until 3 months. Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn't hold. But the little attached toys are very nice - we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time. But I think it's very nice for a baby as they learn head control so that it lifts them a bit off the ground so they don't panic as much
