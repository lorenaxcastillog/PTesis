 I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product. My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory. Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together. There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless. The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit. Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk. I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub
