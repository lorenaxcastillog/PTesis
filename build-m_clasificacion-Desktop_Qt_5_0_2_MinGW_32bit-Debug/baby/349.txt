 Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it. Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table. Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table. The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it. If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair
