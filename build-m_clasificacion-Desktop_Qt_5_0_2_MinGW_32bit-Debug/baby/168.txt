 I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything! I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training. And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't. Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really "go" in the potty. We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's "potty time." When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more. Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it. If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds. Here's a suggestion: Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training. Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do. With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore
