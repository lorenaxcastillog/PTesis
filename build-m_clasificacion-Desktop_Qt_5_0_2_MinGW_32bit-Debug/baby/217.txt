 Ok, this chair is fine except for two very important things. One: the tray is huge, and not in a good way, in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way. Also, the two trays that fit on top, that are dishwasher safe, ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER!!! So what's the point??? Two: it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY, rather than on the chair...making it impossible to set down anywhere when it's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair. Everything else, about the chair is great, but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair. I'm bought the one that's made by the famous toy maker, and love it
