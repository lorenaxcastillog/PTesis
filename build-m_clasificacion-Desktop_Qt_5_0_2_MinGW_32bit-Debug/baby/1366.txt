 We absolutely love the Bundleme. It is so much easier to just tuck her into it than try to wrestle her into a snowsuit or wrap her up in multiple blankets. She is happier and calmer and so are we. It just makes taking her out so much easier, faster and less stressful on all of us. And it has definitely kept her warm this winter. In fact, we have to be careful in the car to make sure we unzip it and pull it down because she gets too hot during trips that last longer than a few minutes. I have recommended this to my sister in law who is pregnant and am considering buying a Bundleme Lite for this spring and possibly next fall if my daughter still fits into it because I have been so pleased with how the original has worked out for us
