 I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub
