 I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews. We wore this sling with both babies, and even when they were toddlers and wanted to be carried (try THAT with a snuggli!) I always kept one hand on the newborn (I wanted to, anyway), but Daddy didn't. As they grew, the sling accommodated different positions with a tug of the strap: front facing, side hip, on my back so I could work in the kitchen. Fit easily over any layers. BEST FEATURE: we could transfer a sleeping baby (or toddler) from one caregiver to another, or lay sleeping child down for nap, without jiggling the wee one out of a carrier or wrestling with readjusting multiple carrier straps to fit different sized people. Our babysitters and friends wore this sling, too
