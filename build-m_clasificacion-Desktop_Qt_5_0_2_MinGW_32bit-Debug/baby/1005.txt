 This tent was not as easy to pop up as the manufacturer claimed. We fussed with it a while before actually figuring out how to do it. No intructions came with the tent. The second time we tried to open it one of the spines broke and now the tent is useless. For $100 it shouldn't have broken that easily. When we had it up the first and only time, however, it was great. Our nine month old son loved it. I sat in the center of the tent while he crawled laps around me, chasing some little plastic balls. He liked hearing the crinkling of the tent fabric as he moved across it. The tent does need to be pegged in any kind of wind, but this is easy to do. Another reviewer said the tent was hot, but we're in Hawaii where there's always at least a breeze and it was fine. There is also a slit in the one wall of the tent which allows the wind to pass through. I'm going to try and contact the manufacturer about the lack of instructions and the relative fragility of the tent's parts. If I am satisfied with their response I will order the tent again. It really was great once it was set up. However, I will be more careful when opening it and will try and find a non-windy place to do it.
