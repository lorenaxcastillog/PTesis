 I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good. Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak. My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star. Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.
