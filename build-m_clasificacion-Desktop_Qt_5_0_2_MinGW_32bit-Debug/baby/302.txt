 I bought this stroller for when we had our second child. My children are 19 mo. apart. I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it. This one is definitely not the same. For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps. The wheels are always getting stuck. Second, it is hard to close. The most frustrating part is the steering issue. Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago. I've only had the stroller for nine months. One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.
