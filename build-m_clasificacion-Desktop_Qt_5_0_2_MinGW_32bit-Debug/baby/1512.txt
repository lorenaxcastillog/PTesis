 If you want to have your baby near you at night, the co-sleeper is great. It makes getting in and out of bed a bit of a challenge, but it is nice to be able to look over and see my infant daughter sleeping, or to comfort her back to sleep with a little rocking with my hand if she is not ready to get up. VERY easy to set up and sturdy. My only complaint is the sheet- it shrinks a lot in the wash, gets tangled up because of the velcro, and is not easy to change quickly. Also, replacement sheets are expensive (@$15). Instead, I recommend using a bassinet sheet- they are exactly the right size, are softer, and are around $5
