 This play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers, espicially ones that garden, since the invention of disposable diapers! I bought two and an extension panel, which make for an ample size playpen. Inside, I put a Little Tikes climber, a Step One ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel, and a Playskool Grow-With-Me picnic table, and he still has plenty of room to romp. I can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips.
