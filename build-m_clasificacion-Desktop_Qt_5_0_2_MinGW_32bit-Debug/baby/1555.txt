 Overall, I've been very impressed so far with this nursery collection. Specifically, I like the quality of the quilting work done -- which, to be honest, I wasn't expecting after just viewing the web picture. Since we live in a warm climate, I decided to use the comforter as a wall hanging above the crib. It looks very lovely, brightens up the room, and shows off all the embroidery on the comforter. Anyway... whether you use this quilt as a blanket or art, I think you get your money's worth
