 I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market. When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play. The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned. The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old. She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings. She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption! And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays. There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys. The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle. I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play. I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up. Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product! I'd put it on the new parent's "must have" list for sure
