 We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it! With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand
