 This works great on our huge king size bed that has a really thick mattress. It also works well with no bed frame. You just shove the horizontal legs in between the mattress and foundation boxes (or box springs) and it stays in place nicely. Easy to add and take away and looks clean and streamlined. Gives me piece of mind at night that my 10 month old baby won't be able to roll out of bed. In the morning when he wakes though he stands up and shakes it so I have to get up right away and pick him up before he throws himself over the top of it. It only works while the baby is sleeping but I don't think many potential buyers would expect more out of it anyway. It's great- highly recommend
