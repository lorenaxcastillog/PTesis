 I bought this pump after the Avent Isis failed me along with an electric pump. The fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great. Im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes. Although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy. From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable. Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply. If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby. And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday.
