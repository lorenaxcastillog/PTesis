 I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased! Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age. We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry. Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won't fall off the wall. Sizewize, it's basically a perfect fit in our tub, which is slightly tapered from head to toe, but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub.
