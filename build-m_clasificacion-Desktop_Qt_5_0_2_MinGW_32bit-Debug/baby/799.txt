 If you are going to get a manual pump, get this one. I got a Medela from the hospital and it was SOOO slow and killed my hand, but this one is way better. It takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela, and it doesn't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals, and because you use it for less time total. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare it to one of those, but as far as manuals go this one is AWESOME
