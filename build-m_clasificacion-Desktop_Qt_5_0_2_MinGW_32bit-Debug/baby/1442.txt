 if i could give this product 10 stars, i would. my son loves to be snuggled up in his swaddle me. he sleeps better and doesnt startle as easily. he has a hard time staying awake when he is in it, so if your baby doesnt stay awake for feedings, you may want to wait until after he is full to swaddle him. i wish i had purchased at least 2. i plan to buy another one, as well as 2 large sized ones. so far i have tried the small microfleece. my son was born 7 lbs and is still using the small one (and its rather large on him) 3 weeks later (not sure how much he weighs now, but 0-3 month sized clothes are still too big for him). in the future, any woman i ever buy a baby gift for is getting 1 or 2 of these from me. you cannot have a baby without one! make sure you get 2 or 3 because you will be miserable when your only swaddle me in the wash, or if you leave it somewhere, like i just did :
