 We have been swaddling our little girl since birth. We started off using just the receiving blanket but as she got bigger she would escape from it or kick her legs free and it would end up like a donut around her waist by morning. She still at 4 months sleeps better with her arms restrained so we have continued swaddling and the SwaddleMe is perfect for that. It's very easy to get her into but doesn't constrict her legs as much as the blanket used to. My only complaint with the product is that there needs to be a large area for the velcro bears to attach to. To wrap it tight enough to hold her arms leaves the bottom bear with nothing to attach to. She may just be on the smaller side for this Large version but she had definately outgrown the Small one because she could no longer straighten her legs in it
