 I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe. This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post. It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it. I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play. My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping. I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up. This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping. I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath
