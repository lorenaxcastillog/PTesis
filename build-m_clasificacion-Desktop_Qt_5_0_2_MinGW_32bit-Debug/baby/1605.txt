 I love this little potty for car trips. My 3 year old is petrified of automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair to use on a recent vacation. She loves it. It is really easy to clean. I just keep some clorox wipes in the car with the seat. It now lives in the back of my minivan incase of an emergency potty stop. We are also using a second one to train our 23 month old son. The splash guard is great and he is very comfortable on the seat
