 We bought this just for travel purposes. For a couple years we've traveled extensively with our big bulky stroller and while that was great for holding carry-ons, it was a pain to move around. So this one is fine for what we use it for: quick trips to the park, moving our two year old around the airport and to toss in the back of the car just in case we need it at the mall. It is a rough ride and kind of squashes him on the sides (he's now 31 pounds) but like I said, it is not our main stroller. I'm 5'5" and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5'11" husband thinks it is fine. We live in CA so being able to fold up the back for a little air circulation is handy but not used so often. I would definitely recommend this if you need to save money or have need for a good quality cheap stroller
