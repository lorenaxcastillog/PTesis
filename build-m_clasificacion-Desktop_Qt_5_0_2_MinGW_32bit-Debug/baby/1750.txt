 I've used these for two babies now and have used the milk after 6mo in deep freeze. They are great most of the time. I freeze about 10-12oz in each bag (yes, they say no more than 6oz, it's a myth). 12 is the maximum I found tho. The trick is to make sure there is no air. It won't leak b/c the bag will expand, unlike plastic storage containers. I use the straight edge of a table, push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out. Don't worry if a little leaks out b/c it has a double zipper. Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly. After it's frozen, I put 8-10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer. It's easier to organize them this way in deep freeze. The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen, the plastic nicks easily if you drop it, scrape it against something, etc (as with all frozen containers). Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they've improved. Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks. Lansinoh customer service is great and will replace them if you encounter leaky bags
