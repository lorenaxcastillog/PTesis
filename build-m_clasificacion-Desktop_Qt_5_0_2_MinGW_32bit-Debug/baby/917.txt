 I have this seat for my 4 month old and I love it... Yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but I have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a Toyota Avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest... With my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car... Graco has made it so that I no longer have to do this. My son is nearly 20lbs already and had I been using your average infant seat I would have to buy him a new one already... Bravo to Graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits... Another perk is it has the canopy so the sun isn't in his eyes which I also wouldn't get if he were in a convertible car seat. My one and only complaint is that the fabric isn't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but I just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine... This in itself isn't enough to make me trade this seat for another
