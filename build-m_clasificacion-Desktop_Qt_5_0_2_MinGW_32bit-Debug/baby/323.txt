 I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn. I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse. Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it. Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick. My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath. The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it. I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out. Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated. Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40. So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-
