 I highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born...if you plan on breastfeeding. I was very sore in the first few weeks. The shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings. I did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks. But they got me through those weeks when I don't know if I'd have made it otherwise! They were a wonderful product for me
