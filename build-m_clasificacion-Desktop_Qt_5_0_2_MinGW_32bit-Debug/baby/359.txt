 We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it
