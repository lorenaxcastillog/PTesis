 I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump. The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do). They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part. It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it. The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use. Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
