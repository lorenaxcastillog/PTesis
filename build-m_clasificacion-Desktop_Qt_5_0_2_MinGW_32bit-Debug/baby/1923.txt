 this is the best car seat I have owned. I have three children and have owned many "light weight" and "easy to use" car seats but the Explorer is the best one yet. Extremely light weight and easy to carry. The base is the best part with clear bubble levels on both sides and easy one hand isntallation. It uses seatbelt like clips to hold the "latch" system connections in place. The only down side is the required use of the base but extremely minor issue with a newborn car seat. Excellent product..
