 This product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home. While others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes, I found that I could keep it velcro'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom. My daughter really liked this, but quickly outgrew it. At just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down, so the usefullness of the product is limited. For a baby who loves being swaddled, this is an indispensible item. I'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs. You never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled
