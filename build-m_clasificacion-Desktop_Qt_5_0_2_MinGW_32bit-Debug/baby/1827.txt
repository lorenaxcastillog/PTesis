 My son is 7 weeks old and has been using the Snuggle Nest in my bed since he was 3 weeks old. He loves his Snuggle Nest and began sleeping 3-4 hours at a time the very 1st night in it. We now use it in combination with the Swaddle Me wrap and the techniques I learned in the free Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that came with our Snuggle Nest. Thanks to this wonderful combo our 7 week old baby sleeps through the night (7-8 hrs). This is my 3rd baby and the 1st I used a Snuugle Nest or swaddling with and he is the 1st to sleep so well so early. If I could give this product 10 stars I would. I also plan to use the Snuggle Nest when/if we transition our baby to his crib in a month or two, I am sure it will make the transition easier on him
