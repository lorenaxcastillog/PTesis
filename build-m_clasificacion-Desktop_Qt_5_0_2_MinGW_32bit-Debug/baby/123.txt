 I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did. Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen. One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space. I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub.
