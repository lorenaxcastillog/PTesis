 This is my first review-only because I disagree with all the negative reviews on this and this potty chair is so wonderful. This potty is easy to clean and very easy for the little ones to use all by themselves. My son will be 3 in 4 months(and he is big for his age) and this potty is not too little for him. He loves the music and it is not distracting to him or too much fun. I however did not use the splash guard as I didn't see the need so I dont know if it falls off easily or not. We had tried everything to potty train him and this chair along with letting him go without pants or diapers on or making sure his training pants are easy for him to pull up and down is the only thing that has worked. He gets to use it by himself and he even dumps it into the real toilet afterwards and he gets very excited about it
