 This is the 4th stroller I've purchased. I had a lightweight COMBI that was GREAT for travel as it folds to be tiny and was only $40. But it was not going to hack it for the everyday use. The larger travel system stoller I had is so cumbersome in stores and difficult to load into the trunk. This ARIA is very easy, looks great, lightweight and found the balance between small and sturdy. I love it. I recommend it to other moms when I get the chance. Peg has a great reputation for lasting, so I hope that this "entry level" price point meets that expectation. So far I feel like it's a great value as far as strollers go
