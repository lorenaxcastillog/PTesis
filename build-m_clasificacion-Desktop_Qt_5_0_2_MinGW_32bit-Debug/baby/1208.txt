 We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year. The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly. I find that if you adjust it right, most of the weight is placed on your hips. Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it. She even fell asleep once. She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even "sings" as she gets bounced around. We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby (she was born with acid reflux). However, we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up. She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground. I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it (too short to really grab). Interesting enough, she never tries to grab my wife's hair. I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair. There are lots of pockets, although if you are wearing the pack, the pockets are very difficult to access, even the ones on the hip. The hip pockets seem too far back (I have a 38" waist). My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do. When taking off the pack, the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem. We dont use the hood. Its not too difficult to put on. Just takes a little time to figure it out. I am 5'10" and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me. My wife is 5'7" and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle-top. At first, it felt awkward walking with the weight, but after a couple of walks, we got used to it. Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk. Im glad we got the pack. We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone
