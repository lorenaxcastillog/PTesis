 I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use. I paid only $10, so not much loss. She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while. I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub. Toys helped distract her when she was a little older. My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight. To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub. I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor. Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink. Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink. The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf. For a little tub bath, I liked it. It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner
