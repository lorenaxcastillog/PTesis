 I was a little worried when ordering this crib because several people said they had problems with shipping and they said they never received the product. I didnt have any problems with the shipping. I received the crib withing the number of day's stated when I ordered (7-14 days). We had no trouble putting the crib together. I would suggest having two people put it together just because it is easier if one person can hold parts of the crib while the other person screws it together. It looks very nice. I have no complaints.
