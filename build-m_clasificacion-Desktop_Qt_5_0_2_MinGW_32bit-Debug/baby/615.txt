 I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room. I have read countless reviews of the "double faced tape foam pads" that come off right away with little effort. This product attached exactly as described. I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes. The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace. I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried. Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced. An absolute must for your hearth.
