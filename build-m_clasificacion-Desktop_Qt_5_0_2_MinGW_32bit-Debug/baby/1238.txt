 Beware that this product does not contain normal sized medicines. They are only 1/2 oz bottles of gas drops, saline drops, acetomeniphen, and decongestant, and only 3/16 oz of teething gel. You will go through any of these medications VERY quickly. But that is probably why the kit costs $20 instead of J&J's $40 one. It is good to have this stuff for emergencies when you don't know what you will need ahead of time. My baby LOVED the taste of the gas drops, but we used up the bottle in a week unfortunately. The Little Fevers was wonderful to bring along to her first shots but didn't last much longer than that. The nasal aspirator is wonderful... so much easier on her nose than the hospital one! It also has a clear tip so you can see when it needs to be clean out. I wish it came with an electrolytes packet too, but I guess you can't have everything. It was worth $20 to have (almost) everything you need at your fingertips, but I wish I didn't have to replace the medicines so soon. I would still recommend this over the J&J kit since you never know what you'll need and what you won't use.
