 While we were preparing for the arrival of our daughter, we were hoping to use these bottles because of the convenience, so when our pediatrician recommended them, the decision was made. These bottles are wonderful!!! They don't have to be scrubbed inside with a brush like one-piece bottles. We just throw them in the dishwasher and they're done. Our daughter has reflux, and the silicone slow-flow natural latch nipples work well for her. Our doctor (along with other doctors in the same group) says that these are the best bottles to cut down on gas. I would highly recommend buying the premium nursers (featured here) instead of the older original nursers that are slowly being phased out. (We have some of each.) The premium lids are a MAJOR improvement-they're easy to pop on and off one-handed, unlike the original lids that you have to pry off with your fingernails. You can interchange all the parts from both systems (use any holder with any ring with any nipple with any lid), but I think the premiums are much better. Also, the premiums come with the silicone nipples, but the originals usually don't. The liners for these nursers are very inexpensive, especially if you use the coupons that come with the bottles or if you buy the store brand liners (they work just as well). The only downside to this system is that there isn't much room at the top of the liner to put in a full 4 ounces of water plus powdered formula and shake. But that problem can happen with any bottle, and I don't think it's a big deal. GOOD NEWS for those who use these bottles! I just discovered today that you can buy extra rings and lids on www.teebop.com. (I got the info. from Playtex over the phone.) I plan to get some extra premium lids to take the place of the few original nurser system lids that I have (and to make up for the ones I will inevitably lose along the way).
