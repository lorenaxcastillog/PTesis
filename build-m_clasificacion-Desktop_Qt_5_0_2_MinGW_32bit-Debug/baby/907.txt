 For all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled, that is incorrect. It was the original Hip Hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves. So unless you have an older model that was bought before 2/2005, you should have nothing to worry about. This product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the Baby Bjorn. I have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies.
