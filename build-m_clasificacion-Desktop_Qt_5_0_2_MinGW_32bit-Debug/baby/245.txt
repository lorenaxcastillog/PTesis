 I got this potty for my baby shower. I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent. I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet). We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it. Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart. Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!
