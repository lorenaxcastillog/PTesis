 Ok, so it took some work convincing my husband to spend the $$ on this, but pointing out that it will last all the way to our son being 65lbs helped a lot. When it arrived we put our son in there and he was-- happy! My son is never happy in a car seat but he loved the fact that he could sit up straighter than in his infant seat. He can finally sit up like a big boy the way he wants to now that he is 5 months old and is a supported sitter. I like the fact that I can recline him if he falls asleep, which is usually the case in the car. I am sure he also appreciates the incredibly soft fabric - I know I would like to sit in a seat that soft. Considering we travel 4-6 hours to visit grandparents, his comfort and happiness is very important to us in a carseat. We pray that we will never have to use all the excellent safety features of this seat, but it is great to know that this is also top of the line in that respect.
