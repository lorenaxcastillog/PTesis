 These are GREAT bottles! I have these and some Medela bottles that came with my breast pump. Dr. Browns wins -- no doubt about it! I guess I'm not as meticulous as some other reviewers on cleaning and sterilizing... I just follow the directions in the package and sterlized when I started out and then I've hand washed ever since. Now, let's face it, washing bottles is a pain regardless. Washing a few more parts is no big deal. It takes me approx. 30 seconds more to do the vent parts. And it's definitely worth the effort. The couple of times I've used the Medela bottles I could visibly see bubbles coming through the milk and rising to the top. Later my baby had lots of gas and spit up. With the Dr Browns bottles that NEVER happens. I don't even use the Medelas as backup "emergency" bottles anymore. I only use them to hold water if I'm taking a trip and need to bring some clean water from home to mix formula. The Dr Browns bottles are a godsend
