 There seems to be quite a few choices for Lamaze animal toys for babies (hippos, giraffes, turtles, etc.). I chose Larry the Lion and he is a big hit with my 3 1/2 month-old daughter. As she's grown, she's discovered new aspects of Larry which keep her fascinated. His bright colors are quite captivating, and his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle. She also quite enjoys playing with his "crinkly" mane, and now that she's teething, I think she really appreciates chewing on the 2 rings and the purple star that are attached to his paws. Larry is already our "stand-by", fail-safe toy when all other toys fail to pique her interest. A thumbs-up from first-time parents
