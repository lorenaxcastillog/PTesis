 We used Avent with our 1st baby and loved it. Now that we are expecting another munchkin, we planning on using them again. I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten. (Avent's site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems) We tried other products, but Avent was the best for our family.
