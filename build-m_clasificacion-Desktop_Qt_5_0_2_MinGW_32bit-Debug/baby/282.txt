 It does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water. It is worse if you use tap water. It doesn't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed. When you lift the cap all the water drip. You will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use. The plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat. You wonder if it is going to melt. I am a fan of Gerber products, but this one does not work
