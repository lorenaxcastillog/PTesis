 This is our third baby monitor. The first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices. This one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static. The talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old ("Go back to sleep," "I'll get you juice in the morning," etc.) Not having to get up and go to the child's room is a real feature. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren't encrypted. Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations, but most monitors are this way. We took the monitor to a friend's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house (Video monitor, TV, I don't know.) Since it only had two channels, we were not able to find a clear channel. Overall thoughts: Best monitor I've had (Stay away from the Fisherprice models). I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex (I wouldn't want other people listening in), and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels
