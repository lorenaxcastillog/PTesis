 We bought this for our daughter when she was approximately 5 months old. She is now 3 and has been sleeping with it every night since then. Whenever she is upset about something she gets her lamby and cuddles with it until she feels better. We always take it on trips with us and she hugs it in the car. It has sewn on eyes so we don't worry about choking hazards. WARNING: When she was very young my daughter got her fingers caught under and twisted in the ribbon around the lamb's neck. We have two back up Fluffles and have cut the ribbons off all of them.
