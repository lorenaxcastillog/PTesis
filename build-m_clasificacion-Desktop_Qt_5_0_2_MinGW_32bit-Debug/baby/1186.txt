 This warmer is a must have. It stops most of the squirming and fighting over changes(once your child gets past the newborn stage). The wipes are nice and warm, but not shockingly hot. I would suggest adding the 1/2 cup of water to the container if you live in a dry climate. I like this model because it does NOT have a built in night light (eventually the light will become attractive to toddlers). It also works very well with any type of wipe, pop-ups and singles. I wish they had portable ones.
