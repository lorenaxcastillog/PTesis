 Within the first two days home after the hospital, I realized I needed more of these! So, my parents went out and bought a couple of each (cotton, mircrofleece, and flannel). My baby definitely preferred the microfleece. It fits the most snugly of the three and didn't shrink like the flannel one. The fabric has a little give and she wasn't able to break free like she was with the cotton one. The cotton ones are also a bit larger in circumference. Overall, the Swaddle Me is very soothing and it greatly improved the quality of sleep for baby and me
