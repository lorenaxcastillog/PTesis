 I just love this lite bundle me! I didn't want to spend the 50 or 60 dollars on the regular bundle me so I decided to give this one a shot and I totally love it. When my four month old is dressed warm it is perfect to just cover her up against the wind. On those colder days I just stick in one of the many fleese blankets she got at her shower and turns into the perfect bundle me. The only thing that I would say about it is that my four month old is almost touching the bottom of it now when in the jogger. No problem, I just ordered the toddler one. I just wish i had gotten this when she was first born. This is definitly a must have.
