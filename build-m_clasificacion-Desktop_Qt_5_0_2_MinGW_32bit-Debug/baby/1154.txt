 How much can you write about a high chair? My daughter fits in the seat. It looks comfortable, though I haven't tried it myself yet. The tray goes on and off fairly easy with one hand. Looking at the hardware though doesn't give me much confidence this will last more than one child. The tray insert works well and makes clean up much easier. Would be nice if they included 2 inserts, but I guess just having one makes sure I clean it sooner. My daughter loves the toy that attaches to the tray. It really helps keep her amused while we prep her food and she goes out of her way to hunt it down when she's just playing and not in the seat. Assembly was fairly easy and the instructions were clear. I was amazed they were able to break this down into as many parts as they did. If you liked Erector Sets as a kid you'll like putting this together. It took about 30 minutes and hardly any foul language
