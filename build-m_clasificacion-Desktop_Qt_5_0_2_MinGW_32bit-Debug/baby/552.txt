 Finally! A big, spacious, nice looking toy box!! I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor, but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there! The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up. The drawers on the bottom are small, but hold a few things, and don't take anything away from the big interior of the box. It makes the box look more sofisticated!! Love the new colors and design. Thanks Little Tikes!
