 This is a great tub for any baby able to sit up on their own. It is the perfect size with room for your little one to grow. It not only saves on water you would use to fill a larger tub but gives your little one a sense of security. When i tried our baby in the big tub he cried and didnt like it so i tried him back in his infant tub and he was fine. I realized it was a matter of security for him. The large tub was just so over-whelming. He loves to squeek the duck and play with tossing rings. Price is just right to! Just be careful when you inflate tub because it inflates in sections. My husband used an air compressor thinking it was all one compartment to fill with air and it blew up
