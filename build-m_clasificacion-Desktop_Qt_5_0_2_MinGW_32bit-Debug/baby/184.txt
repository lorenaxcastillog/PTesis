 When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it.
