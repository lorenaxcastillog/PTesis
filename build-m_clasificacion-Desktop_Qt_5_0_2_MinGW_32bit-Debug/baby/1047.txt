 A bit difficult to install, the guide for marking the placement of the screws was slightly off so we couldn't fit the feet on, but that's okay because we didn't actually need them. Looks nice, better than the white barred gates. I find it easy to open. I can do it one handed once you figure out how to do it. EASY TO CLEAN! We have the gate up to keep kids in our out of the kitchen. When eating lunch they tend to touch the gate with sticky messy hands but wipes off easily with a wet cloth. People often comment how nice the gate is. I love the neutral color. Happy with the purchase
