 This is an amazing product. I had seen other shopping cart covers in the stores but they all have little ties and velcro sides and look quite complicated. Who has time for all of that? With the Floppy seat you just stretch it over the cart, slide the seat belt through, buckle and go. It covers all of the surfaces of the cart, unlike some others. It's so nice and comfy, lots of cushion and I can attach a toy to the loops and put my baby's sun hat in the pocket. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I know it is more expensive than some of the covers that are in the stores but it is well worth the extra cost. This is one of the best baby products we have purchased
