 I thought I would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore! I saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when I started to breastfeed. I placed the gelpads on, and within two hours, I could see the healing begin. I tried olive oil nipple cream, and didn't even want to try anything with lanolin because I read it wasn't good to ingest,and it did not help at all. This is a great way to sooth nipples naturally. Just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk (natural oils), and then place the pads on the nipples. they are LIFE SAVERS. I think I only needed three pairs, until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding (about 2-3 weeks). DON'T GIVE UP! Try these first, these work
