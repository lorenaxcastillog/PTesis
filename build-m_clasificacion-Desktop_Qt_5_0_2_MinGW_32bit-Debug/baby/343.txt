 I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy, they button onto the car seat and it isn't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off. The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on. I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out. But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don't want them to get a crook in their neck. I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat.
