 We just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters - they're great. They're strong enough to keep our 11-month-old baby from falling through -- we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened. I still intend to watch him carefully when he's up there, but these will definitely protect him in an emergency. Just be sure to follow directions -- tie them tightly!! They're not that bad, looks-wise, either. I can still see my spindles through the netting so the "look" of the stairway is basically unchanged. Of course, looks are less important than safety! I think I'm going to get these for our outdoor deck, as well. I'd recommend them
