 I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead. Boy, was that a bad decision. We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds! Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this. I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket. I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier
