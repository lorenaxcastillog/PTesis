 We bought this stroller from BRU in Dec. for a trip to Disney. Our Graco was too bulky and hard to fold to mess with getting on and off buses and rides. I chose this stroller after trying out ALL the strollers at the store and made sure it was easy to use and very lightweight. I love that the 5-point harness comes off the back so my son can sit forward in the seat. The back lays all the way down, unlike my Graco. The basket is a good size, but difficult to get things in and out of if the baby is laying down. We have no trouble keeping the cup holder in the tray. One warning: make sure you take the buttons off the handles after you fold the stroller if you put it on an airplane. They pop off easily and luckily an airline worker found ours in the luggage compartment. This is the only stroller I use now and my Graco is collecting dust
