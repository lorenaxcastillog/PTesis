 We picked this swing over others because it's bright and colorful and because of the sound and speed options. We don't find the motor to be noisy at all... in fact the white noise is rather calming for the baby. It has taken my son a month or two to get used to it. I think he just noticed the moblie a week ago (he's 2 months) I think as he gets older and can play with the front tray he'll like it much more. Good points: *Familiar songs (to other Baby Einstein products) *Speed settings really are different. *Seat reclines quite a bit, very comfortable *front tray has many options such as speech, sound and songs as well as rotation. *parent friendly and easy to assemble *not "graco green" rather cheerful looking. *removable tray toy is great for "tummy time" or carseat toy. *cheery, stimulating moblie. *noise is adjustable. *good restraint. baby is secure. Flaws: *the mobile is too high up for newborns. My son didn't notice it until recently, each time i tried to point it out, he just looked at me instead. *the plastic tray sticks so tightly that it takes a real hard pull to open it. It always gives the baby a jolt. *songs on the front tray are too short I keep having to go up and press it to keep him interested. *the nature sounds sound more like static than anything else, great idea, just needs to be clearer. If you don't mind the minor flaws its a great swing for a good price compared to others
