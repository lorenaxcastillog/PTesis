 I bought this seat when my son was 8 months old as he was too big for his Graco sung ride. I have a 2005 Honda CRV. In the rear facing position the seat belt was not long enough to strap it to the seat. My SUV only has the LATCH system on the side seats and not the middle seat. I spoke to the car safety officier for the police department and he told me to place him in the side seat behind the passenger seat as this would be the safest place in regards to incidence of accidents since I could not use the middle position. The reason he told me not to use the LATCH in the middle position (by using the side seats LATCH system) since my SUV is not equipped with it is because the LATCH is connected to the car frame and if we were in an accident and the frame of the car bent it could tear his seat in pieces. I was not aware that the LATCH was connected to the frame. So the officier told me that when he is able to be forward facing I should be able to put him back in the middle seat as it shouldn't require so much length of the seatbelt. I love this seat and so does my son who is now 9 1/2 months. It is very soft and cushy. I probably wouldn't have bought the infant car seat if I was aware this seat could accomodate even a newborn. I would definately recommend this seat. It was very easy to install. It does not have a cup holder and that is the only thing I wish it had for when he is older
