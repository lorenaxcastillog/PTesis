 This bib has changed mealtime for the better! I tried all sorts of fancy bibs because I thought this bib would be uncomfortable for my tiny baby. Boy was I wrong! After the initial fuss she now loves this bib. She is comfortable and clean! The bib catches every drop of food, water and her super staining vitamin drops! FYI Even this fantastic bib can't shield you from unexpected baby sneezes during feedings! I stained and ruined so many cloth bibs before I finally took this out of the box and now I only use this one! Plus one in my car for on the go feedings! More colors please Baby Bjorn
