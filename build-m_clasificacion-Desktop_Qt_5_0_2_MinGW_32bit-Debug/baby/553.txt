 This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old. He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror. He also loves the music, which calms him down when he is crying. The music is soothing and doesn't grate on our nerves even though we've heard it many times. My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play. It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times. There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme. All in all, a good product that I would buy again. By the way, the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle
