 We are using this bather for our son who is one month old. What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby. The fabric is also very soft, quick drying, and removable for machine washing. The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby's waist. To keep him warm, we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath. Since we don't fill up the tub with water, slippage has not been a problem
