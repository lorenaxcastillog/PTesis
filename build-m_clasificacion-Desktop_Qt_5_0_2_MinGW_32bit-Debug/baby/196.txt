 This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago. We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well. It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be. I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump & Go). People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier. Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump & Go version a lot
