 I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat. My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY. If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat. I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer. Honestly, now I am skeptical of any "tummy time" mat. I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs. Better off spending the money elsewhere
