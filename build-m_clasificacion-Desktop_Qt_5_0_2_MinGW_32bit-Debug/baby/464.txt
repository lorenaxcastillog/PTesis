 We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did. We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day. The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful. I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine. He doesn't play with the toy attachment. I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame
