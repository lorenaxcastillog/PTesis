 I've heard some say this is the best warmer available. If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time. Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium. Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place. Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow. If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open. Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap". To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...
