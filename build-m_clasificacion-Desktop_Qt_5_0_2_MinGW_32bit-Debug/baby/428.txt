 The kneeling stool is great. The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful! BUT...the elbow pad is a joke! There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic. Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all. It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it. I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail
