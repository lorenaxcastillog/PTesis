 I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first "big girl" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed
