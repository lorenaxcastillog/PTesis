 Our seven month old daughter does not like being on her tummy so she does not like to crawl or attempt to crawl. She loves kicking and we got the Johnny Jump Up Bug to help her use her legs more without having to be laying down on her tummy. She loves it. She now loves sitting up and kicking her legs and making herself move around. Since Johnny Jump Up Bug does not have a tray it is easy to get her in and out and she has not come close to pinching her fingers like the reviews for jumpers that have trays usually state. We are very pleased with the quality for it's low price and will use it for our future kids
