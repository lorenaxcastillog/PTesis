 We live in the cold, rainy Northwest part of the country. This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December. It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital. We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat. He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me. This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby. It is a must for Winter babies. It is well worth the money
