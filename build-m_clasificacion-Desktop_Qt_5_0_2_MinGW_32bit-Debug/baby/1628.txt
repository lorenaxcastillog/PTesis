 While my son was still riding rear facing in the car, he would often lose his pacifier. Without a pacifier keeper, it was next to impossible to locate. I had trouble searching around the carseat because I could not see where to reach. I found this pacifier keeper useful because I always knew Spencer's pacifier was near. Now trips in the car are less stressful. He is even big enough to find it himself! I never have to worry that it has fallen on the floor of the car, either. What a great idea
