 I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down. I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it, as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use.

I am a very price sensitive, I shop at consignment shops, etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it! The reason I like this stroller: 1. You can guide it with one hand. 2. There is a spot for bags, etc underneath. 3. The cup holder for mommy and child. (this is an extra accessory) 4. It's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily. 5. The five point harnes
