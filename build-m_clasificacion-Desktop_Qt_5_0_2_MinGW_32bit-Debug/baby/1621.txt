 Although this product isn't perfect, I really couldn't imagine traveling without it. Pros: 1. Able to have hands free (to push stroller, hold child, or other luggage)while seat is on your back like a backpack 2. Travel case folds up small and nicely - can fit under plane seat 3. Sturdy (I didn't have any issues of rips/tears like some other reviewers) Cons: 1. It can be a bit annoying trying to get the car seat in it, but it does fit 2. Strap buckle dug into my shoulders; tried to adjust it, but wasn't able to make it much better 3. The carrier flips occasionally while in the stroll mode All in all, DEFINITELY buy this product if you are traveling with a child. I don't know of a better alternative and I can't imagine being able to carry everything through the airport without it!
