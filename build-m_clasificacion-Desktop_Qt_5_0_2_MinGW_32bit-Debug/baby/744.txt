 This was a great carseat and carrier. Easy to install with the level indicator. A few drawbacks: Once my daughter was a few months old, it got really heavy to carry around. She also outgrew it by 6 months. The harness needs to be longer. It doesn't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably. And for some reason, the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use. My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood (because she couldn't move the handle up) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom (because she couldn't move the handle back). My advice, before you buy, realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand
