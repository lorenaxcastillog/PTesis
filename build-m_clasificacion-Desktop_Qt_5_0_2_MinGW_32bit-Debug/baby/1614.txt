 Great stroller! So easy to use. It's smooth and lightweight. It fits just fine in the back of my minivan. My 3 year old loves the options to sit or to stand. My 6 month old fits nice and snug in the front. I have no complaints and have showed it to my friends, who also really like it. I compared and researched a number of strollers and am so pleased with this purchase. The parent tray could be larger, but that's my only beef with the stroller. I have back problems and I think that it's easy to manuver and steer and I don't really notice a weight difference between this and my single Peg P. stroller. LOVE IT!
