 The idea for this product is great. The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles. The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex. This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place. They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage. If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect
