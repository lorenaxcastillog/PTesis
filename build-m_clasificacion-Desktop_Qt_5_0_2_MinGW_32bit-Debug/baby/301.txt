 I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria. I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year. I had the Peg MT single first and loved it. So thought the product quality would be the same. Used it for 2 years with no problems. But have to say stay clear of the aria design. Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc. Its not durable at all! We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too! We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off. My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product. She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno. It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second
