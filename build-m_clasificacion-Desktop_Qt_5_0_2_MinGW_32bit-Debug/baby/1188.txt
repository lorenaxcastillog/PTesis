 This is one of the best gifts we received for our twins! Both girls cried horribly when the cold wipes touched their bottoms. Which is horrible for those middle-of-the-night changes when you want to disturb them as little as possible. Grant you the wipes don't stay hot for very long but they do take the chill out. As for &quot;drying-out&quot; the wipes, the instructions say to add about 1/4 cup of water if needed, which works great. We've only had to add water once, and that was to a cheap brand of wipes that weren't very wet to begin with. I definately recommend this to mothers of multiples! I plan to buy another to keep downstairs (our nursery is on the second floor) for those in-between changes
