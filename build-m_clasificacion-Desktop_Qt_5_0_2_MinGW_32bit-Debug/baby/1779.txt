 We are very happy with this dresser, especially considering the reasonable price when looking at other dressers. It looks beautiful with the matching Ellis crib and was easy to assemble. Although the drawers may not be sturdy enough to last for 20 years of wear and tear, this is perfect for nursery furniture and we plan to use it for all our future children's nurseries. Fortunately we didn't have any scratches or dents with this dresser, but Simplicity had good customer service when we needed a replacement part for the crib.
