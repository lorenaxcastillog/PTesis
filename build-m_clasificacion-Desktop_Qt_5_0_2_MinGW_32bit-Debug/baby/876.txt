 AFTER READING ALL THE HORROR STORIES, WE WERE LEARY TO PURCHASE BUT DECIDED TO WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR CHILD'S BIRTH. WE RECIEVED THE ARMOIRE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING THE ORDER. IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER (LESS THAN 1.5HRS). THERE WERE SOME SCREWS MISSING FOR THE DOORS, BUT I CALLED STORCRAFT THE NEXT DAY, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT THROUGH WITH NO BUSY SIGNALS. THEY SENT OUT THE SCREWS AND I HAD THEM WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS (THEY COME FROM CANADA). IT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH NOT ONE NICK OR DING IN IT. WE'D RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AS PART OF THEIR CHILDS NURSERY. FYI - IT WAS NOT CHEAPER AT WALMART ONCE TAX AND SHIPPING WERE INCLUDED
