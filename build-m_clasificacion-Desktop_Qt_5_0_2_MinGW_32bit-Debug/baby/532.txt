 I replaced our old Ocean Wonders Aquarium soother with this Rainforest Waterfall version about a month and a half ago. The Aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music, but I was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time. With the Aquarium, I had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep. Not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all I want to do is fall back asleep. I had read that the Waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes, so I thought I'd check it out. The soother has 3 different length settings: lights, music/sounds, and movement for 6 minutes; lights and music/sounds for 12 minutes; music/sounds only for 18 minutes. There are 3 settings for the sounds: rainforest sounds without music; rainforest sounds and lullabies; rainforest sounds and classical music. There are 3 volume settings as well. I have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and I rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time. She almost instantly settles down once the music starts. If I happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she's still awake, she'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own. And I'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as I try to fall back asleep. My only complaint is that the lights seem REALLY bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep. I ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit. The baby can't see the critters, but since I don't have them set to move, it's not really a big deal. Despite the bright lights, we're happy with this soother
