 This little kit is two in one. It has all that you need for grooming and all that you need for baby health. The only thing we don't use is the clippers because we like the one that 1st years has with the magnifing glass. The comb and brush are perfect, and she absolutely LOVES the rattle! Surprise! I thought it was just kind of an extra, but we take it with us everywhere. The suction bulb isn't that bad like others have said. The case that it comes in is really great! It has a pocket for storing other things in the back which we use for nose drops, tylenol, etc. Having it all in one place is great because we can easily grab it and go if we are going to grandma's. I'm sure we'll be using this into her toddler years!
