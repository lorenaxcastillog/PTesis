 We've been using Peg Perego's newest SIP car seat since our son was 6 weeks old. Our son LOVES this car seat...he NEVER fusses in it and is always happy to go for a ride! As other posters have mentioned the seat angle is very high and upright. We personally didn't find this to be a problem as it helps with our son's reflux. Another poster mentioned the straps are uncomfortable, however pads for the shoulder straps are included with purchase. We found the canopy to be quite sufficient. We have an older Primo Viaggio from 2002 and like the features of the 2006 version ever better. Yes, it is expensive but IMO the safety of the seat is worth it. Plus, you don't have to re-thread the straps everytime you need to readjust the shoulder height
