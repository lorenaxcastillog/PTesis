 I already bought the Noah's Ark design for this type of display; we keep it in the living room (I reviewed that display in more detail). We purchased this one for our son's bedroom. I wish the canvas came in more colors than just red, but the natural wood is beautiful. It was very easy to put together - only took a couple of minutes. It's sturdy, but light-weight. It holds all sizes of books, and can hold anywhere from 12 to 36 books depending on their size and shape. The 1st Guidecraft book display help us teach our son to respect his books. He took such good care of them (like putting them back in the display instead of throwing them on the floor), that we have been able to introduce paperbooks to our 18 month-old, and he doesn't try to tear them apart. I think this type of book display is more practical for children's books than a traditional bookshelf, due to shapes and sizes
