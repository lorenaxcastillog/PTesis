 When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there. Boy, was I wrong! These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding. I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies. I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them. Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles. You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag. They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator. There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal. The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled. Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings. Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product. If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else. Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation
