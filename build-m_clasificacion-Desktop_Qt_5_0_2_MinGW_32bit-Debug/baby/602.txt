 I was debating between this analog model and digital models. I have never heard the digital models to be honest. But this analog model has been great. I can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to "buy time" when I am busy and can't get to her immediately. I have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about. If your family is on a tight budget like mine, this is in the best bang for the buck out there today
