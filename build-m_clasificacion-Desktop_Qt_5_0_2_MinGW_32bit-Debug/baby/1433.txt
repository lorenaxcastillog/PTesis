 we have been using this seat saver for 16 months now and it has not ruined our leather seats. Every month I take out the (convertible) car seat and clean seat and re-install to do safety check and the seats are just fine.

My only suggestion to manufacture would be to make it a bit more narrow...it takes up more space on the actual vehicle seat than needed. The two-stage version is the only way to go
