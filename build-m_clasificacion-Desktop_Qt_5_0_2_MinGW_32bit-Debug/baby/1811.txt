 I have been through 5 humidifiers in the last 2 months. This is the only one that I have found that sufficiently does the job! There is no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer for a length of time because there is no vapor. After buying others like this, that draws dry air in and releases cool and moist air, I was skeptical to spend the money on this one because I found the others not to work well at all! When running this humidifier for the first time, I could actually notice a difference in the humidity level in my daughter's room after running it for about an hour. This did not happen with the others. Yes, it is a loud unit but you get used to it and it does a great job of draining out all of the other noise in the home for my toddler while she is sleeping. I have never had a problem with the filter or finding replacements, nor have I had a problem with my toddler taking it apart. I am very please with this product and will continue to recommend it to others.
