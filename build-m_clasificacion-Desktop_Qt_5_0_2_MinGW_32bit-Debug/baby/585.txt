 This is absolutely the best bottle on the market. After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these. Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too. The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto. Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast. If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean. Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up. I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot. Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!! Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying. But not really. 100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks. So not as bad as you might think. (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles. They also have relatively large nipples. But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.)
