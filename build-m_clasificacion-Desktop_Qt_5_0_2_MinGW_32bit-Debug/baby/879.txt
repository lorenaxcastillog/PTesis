 My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit. It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper. The price is also not bad at all. The only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable. (We went to Baby Depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $20.) Even after buying the extra mattress pad I still think the portable crib was a good buy and I do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all. (I would buy the crib again if I had to start all over--our son sleeps quite well in it.
