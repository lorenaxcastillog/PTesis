 I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer
