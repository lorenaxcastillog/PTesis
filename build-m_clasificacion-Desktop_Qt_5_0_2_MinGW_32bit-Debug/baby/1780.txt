 I started out pumping and thought I would store all of my milk in Medela's bottles. When I realized how much milk I would need to store, I quickly realized that would cost me an arm and a leg (the bottles run about 20 bucks for 4!) and came upon these little wonders. They are made of a thick polyethylene plastic (safe for long-term storage) and you can't beat the zip-loc style closure compared with other tie bags...those scared me, every drop truly is precious. Granted, they are a bit awkward at first because you are dealing with a container that is much less sturdy than the plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used to it.
