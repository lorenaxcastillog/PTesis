 this bag was purchased a month ago to ease my long flight from california to NY with my 10 month old who was sick and teething at the time. well it was a great purchase. i didn't have to fumble for my id, or fumble for her juice or anything. i use it everyday now. it holds everything we need it to hold. the middle pouch we put her container of cheerios and dried fruit snacks with some biter biscuits as well. and the bottom pouch i put my wallet with disposable changing pads and placemats and bibs, and the top one i put her diapers and wipes and occasionally her juice cup since they're wider than a bottle is so they don't fit in the bottle holder. i also use the bottle holder to put her crackers in it for the restaurants. it's a wonderful bag, hooks onto the stroller which is a wonderful thing and it doesn't slip off your shoulder like the big bulky bags. i think every mom needs one of these bags!
