 Ok just so you guys know, as a student of child development and safety, your child WILL NOT suffocate due to a use of bumper pads. The only reason this has happened is because the parents have not securely positioned their sleeping child and the child rolls over, buries his or her face in the bumper, and suffocates. You should, however, remove the bumpers once your child is able to pull him or her self to a standing position in the crib, since the bumper can be used as a step to climb up and fall out. I hope this puts some of your minds at ease.
