 I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.
