 Finally a product from Fisher Price that is worth the money!! These are the second set of Fisher Price monitors we have purchased and are loving them - unlike the first set. We especially love having 10 different channels to select from, reception display, battery display, rechargable batteries, low battery alarm, terminal/reciever disconnection alarm, and most of all clear sound and NO static. We struggled for months with another model of monitors from Fisher Price and ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation from family. We are glad to ditch the other ones and are completely happy with these!
