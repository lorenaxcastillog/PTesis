 We call him Seizure Dog because the color scheme is, frankly, almost nauseating to grown-up eyes. But babies react to this little guy like no other toy I've seen. It was really the first thing that my daughter ever responded to outside of food and people. She used to fall asleep holding some part of Seizure Dog's anatomy and would wake up playing with one of the various dangly bits. The high-contrast and bright primary color scheme really draws infants' eyes, especially from generally (and appropriately!) sedate and relaxing nurseries. We now buy Seizure Dogs for all of our friends with babies. The next one we get will be the 6th one of these we've purchased, so I'd have to say we highly recommend it
