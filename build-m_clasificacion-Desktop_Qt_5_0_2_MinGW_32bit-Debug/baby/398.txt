 As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition. I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies. I bought a starter kit and several other bottles. I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak. I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid. Nothing helped. My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them. I switched to another brand and now we are very dry
