 I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies-r-us, but it was so much more expensive. This is perfect for my new baby girl. I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too. Also, there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set. The lamp, rug, and mobile are a must! =) The set comes with only one window valance, and as my nursery has 2 windows, I had to purchase an additional valance. Just something to keep in mind when buying this
