 We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter. Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise! It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before! We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel. I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!
