 I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive. You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference. I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety
