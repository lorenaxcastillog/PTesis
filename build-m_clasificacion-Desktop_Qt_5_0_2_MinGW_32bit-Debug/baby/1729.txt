 I initially bought the Rainforest bouncer but wasn't too happy with it. The hanging toys hung way too low and were made of a hard plastic. My baby got his foot stuck in them. I returned it for this one and my baby boy loves it. He smiled immediately at the puppy when I turned it on and watched it the entire time then went to sleep. I actually liked the idea of this bouncer because the puppy is more upbeat rather than soothing like the other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime. By the time he gets tired, the puppy and music shuts off and he sleeps peacefully in the vibrating chair. My ONLY minor complaint is I wish the ball on the toy bar cracked or squeaked. But overall, a terrific purchase!
