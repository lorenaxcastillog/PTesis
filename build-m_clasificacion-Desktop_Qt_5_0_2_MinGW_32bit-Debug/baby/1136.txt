 This is the lightest easiest stroller. It's small enough to stash in the trunk and still be able to buy groceries. If my son decides he doesn't want to ride in it, it's light enough to fold up and carry on my shoulder. I like that there is a sun shade and I love the 5-point harness, I have used the rain bonnet once in a marathon, I was the only one without a wet kid. The seat also is angled towards the back so the child doesn't slide right out when you release the buckes like some strollers. Has zippers on both sides to recline for sleeping. It does make for a slightly reclined chair, but he doesn't mind. Very well made and sturdy, mine has been through a lot. I have owned it for about 1 1/2 years with no problems
