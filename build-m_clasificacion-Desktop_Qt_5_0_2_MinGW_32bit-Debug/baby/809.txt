 I love this item. It really works well in February winter weather. I bought 4 snowsuits and I haven't used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious. I am able to put her in her car seat, put a blanket inside and put a hat on her. Forget the suits and mittens. I cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly. Also, it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they can't see her when I cover her up. The only problem is that this item didn't fit well with the newest Peg Perego infant car seats. I made it work, but it doesn't fit perfectly. It worked with the old Peg Perego car seat, but not the newest one. I loved this item so much that I've made it work, though. It isn't perfect, but it works. It actually is so much better than Peg Perego's cover, which came with the car seat. This cover has made my life pretty easy. I found it easy to put on the Peg Perego. I love the color. It zips up easily. It is soft. Isabella seems to like to snuggle in it. It is comfy for her. Be aware, though, I live in Salt Lake City, UT. Our winters are mild. If you have colder winters, you may want to add a snowsuit. Still, it is worth the money! I am glad I bought it.
