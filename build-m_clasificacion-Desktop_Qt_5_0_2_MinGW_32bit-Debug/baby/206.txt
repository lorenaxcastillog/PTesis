 I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her! Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund
