 My mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson. As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom, can be a very very exciting feeling. When we recieved our dresser, we did not open it right away. Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box, to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half. We called stork craft and reordered the part. The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us. My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel. I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped. That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house. Til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel. My suggestion- Please read every review before purchasing any items rom fSTORK CRAFT......... There furniture and customer service is not reliable. OUR BABIES DESERVE BETTER........... DON"T YOU THINK
