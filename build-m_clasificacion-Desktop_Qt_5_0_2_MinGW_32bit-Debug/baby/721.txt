 This monitor is by far the best baby item we have. I love that I can sleep at night, and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing. We have been using it for 4 months, and have had no false alarms. You just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby! I did not have this monitor with my first child, and I sure wish that I had. It is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids, whether this is your first or your fifth baby. Well worth the added expense. Don't even mess around with other monitors, just get this one and get some sleep! By far the BEST ITEM I own for my baby.
