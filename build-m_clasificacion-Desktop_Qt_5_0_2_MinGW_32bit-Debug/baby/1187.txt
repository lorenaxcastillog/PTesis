 I bought this wipe warmer for my son right after he was born because he hated diaper changes. So, I thought that it was the coldness of the wipes that upset him. My son is now 4 months old, and ever since we got it, we have had no problems with &quot;fits&quot; during diaper changes. Not 1! It doesn't stay &quot;hot&quot; very long after you take it out of the warmer, but it is still warm. I have never had a problem with it and would reccommend it to everyone...especially mom's with boys.
