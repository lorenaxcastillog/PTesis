 I ordered the essentials bag after struggling with a bulky regular diaper bag and my newborn. The essentials bag fits a blanket for laying the baby on to change, a new outfit, at least two diapers, a wipes case, three 6 oz. bottles, a formula dispenser, my wallet, keys, pacifer, burp cloth, and cell phone. Everything has it ones compartment, which makes finding everything easy, no digging around in the middle of a big bag, and due to the design it feels much lighter than a larger bag. I have not had issues with the seams coming apart either. I also recommend the Bundle Me, by JJ Cole, it makes winter travel with babies so much easier than a snow suit
