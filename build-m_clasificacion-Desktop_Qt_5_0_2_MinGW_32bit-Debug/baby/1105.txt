 This is a great take-off on the normal boppy (which is also a wonderful invention!). I like that it's smaller, which is better for propping baby up for tummy time. I also like that toys attach to the boppy. I usually add a few more links on, for variety ... but this is not necessary. Tummy time is such an important part of baby's day, especially because of doctors' suggestions of keeping baby on his back to sleep. This is a great way to keep tummy time easy and fun
