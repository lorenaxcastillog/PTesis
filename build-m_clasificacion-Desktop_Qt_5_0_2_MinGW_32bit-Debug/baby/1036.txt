 this product is workin darn good for me. ya so what a couple things fall out of place you people act like your kids toy box stays organized. there are only 12 pieces in there its not that hard to sort through and put them back in their respective slots. and the handle issue.........grab it by the bottom....ur an adult you dont need a lunch pale anymore.....and the person crying about it not staying securely latched get creative and shove a little tape behind the clip...it will stay extended and lock in place....good product........good price......what more can you ask for.
