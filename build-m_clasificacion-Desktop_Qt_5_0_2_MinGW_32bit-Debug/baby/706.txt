 I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!
