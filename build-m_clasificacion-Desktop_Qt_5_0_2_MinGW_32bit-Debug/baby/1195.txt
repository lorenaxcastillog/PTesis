 My baby LOVES this toy! 4 Months old and I bring it with us when we go out. He falls to sleep quickly when I just set it in front of him and rotate it around, he hears the rattles and it soothes him. The fish has beads in it, the cylinder thing has a spiral around it which facinates him along with little stars which make a neat rattle. The round sphere has a mirror in it which swivels along with little ribbon pieces that stick out making a little more touch/feel interest and the flat piece has a holographic fish on it that swims when you move it. All in all it is his favorate toy. It does a good job when suctioned to a glass top table, but will come off anything else. :) Oh well...
