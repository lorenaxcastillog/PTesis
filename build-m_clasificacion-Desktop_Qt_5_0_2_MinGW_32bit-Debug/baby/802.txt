 This is a durable and quality product. My son uses it for everything, from turning the lights on to getting on the potty. I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old. I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable, classic in design and color. This is a sturdy non-slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs (give or take 10 lbs!) We used it so much that I bought another step stool, made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn
