 I love this product. I have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early. I swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the NICU and they loved sleeping that way. I stopped swaddling them at 2 months because I could see they no longer liked it. My night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year. She said it would help them sleep through the night. I bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them. Not long after I started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7. What a dream! He is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all. I have found that it works better when I put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep. We don't use them during the day now. I will always give this as a baby gift going forward
