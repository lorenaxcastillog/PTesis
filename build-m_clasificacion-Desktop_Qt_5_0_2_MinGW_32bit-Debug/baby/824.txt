 It took no time to figure out how to use this seat. My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car. The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding. I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry. My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water. They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat. Highly recommended.
