 I got this stroller last week... I agree with the other reviewers to skip the joovy... I only got that one because I thought the more expensive the stroller the better. Was I wrong... the Joovy way too heavy and hard to push - no tray to carry anything, not as big of a basket on the bottom. The sit n stands front seat is way bigger. My 4.5 year old has more room in back to sit & stand. I have a 4.5 year old that is by no means short neither she is 44 inches and weighs 42 lbs and a 7 month old that weighs 15 lbs. I love the infant car seat holder. This works our really well... I didn't know they had this option when I bought it so it was a bonus for me since I thought I was going to have to take my 7 month old daughter out of her carseat to put in this stoller, but I just put my infant carseat in there. This stoller is compatable with almost all infant car seats - we have Graco. It it by no means at all hard to push... my 4.5 year old loves to sit in the back of the baby... definately worth the $120... I wish I would have gotten this one before the joovy. I have taken this stoller to the airport and shopping so far and it has made my life easier with a 4.5 year old and an infant. I am 5'7 and the handle to push is perfect for my height - usually a problem I have with other strollers the handles being lower.
