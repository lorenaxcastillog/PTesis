 I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child. I wish I would have used this system for all my children. I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone
