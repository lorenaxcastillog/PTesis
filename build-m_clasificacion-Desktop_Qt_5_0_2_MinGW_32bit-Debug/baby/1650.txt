 I received a different carrier and both me and my baby hated it. he couldn't see what was going on and it seemed to smother him and it hurt my back. I decided to purchase the Moby, and I am so happy with it. You can wear it a million different ways (well, not a million, but a lot) and it's so comfortable. It only took me twice to get the hang of how to put it on. My son loves it too. My shoulders or back never hurt after carrying him in it. I also love the book it comes with to show you the different ways in which to wear it. If you lose it, you can go to the manufacture's website, and you can download and print from there. I've bought two more for my friends since I got mine
