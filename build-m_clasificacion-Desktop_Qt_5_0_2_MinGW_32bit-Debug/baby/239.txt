 We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.
