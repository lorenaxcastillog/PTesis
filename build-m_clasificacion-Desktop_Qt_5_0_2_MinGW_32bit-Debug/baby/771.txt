 Table toppers are an awesome product. We don't leave the house without them. It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp.... there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper. We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing. The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food. Other people, not only parents, ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product
