 No hidden surprises, and even a couple of bonuses. It's cute, fits well and my twin boys LOVE the handles!!! A nice bonus is that is comes with adhesive cushions so there's no chance of scratching. Another thing I really like is that the splash guard is nice and secure. We have "Blues Clues" potty ring and the splash guard is always sliding to one side or the other or simple falling off and it does not have handles for them to hold onto. We much prefer this one
