 I have never had problems with these bottles leaking if stored correctly. I use the discs with the nipples when traveling so that I don't need the full caps except for storage. Honestly I don't use these to freeze, because it would be too expensive. I use the Lansinoh bags for that and these work great for the fridge and shorter term storage. The strange little nipples are the first ones that help my son with a latching problem. He always sucked air when he fed, that is no problem with these, and are really the only reason I buy this product as opposed to other less expensive bottles for storage
