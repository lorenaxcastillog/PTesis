 I purchased this product because I had a crib that converted to a toddler bed, but it didn't come with any kind of railing to keep my little guy from falling out. Since the toddler bed uses the crib mattress, I was a little concerned about the large size of the bolster--it covers the entire length of the mattress--but my son figured out how to climb right over it to get into and out of bed. It does pop off the mattress sometimes when he is getting in or out, but it isn't too difficult to strap it back on when I tuck him in. I couldn't find any other kind of railing that fit my son's bed, so the BedBugz saved me from just having to pile pillows on the floor next to the bed
