 I have such a difficult time breastfeeding that it is near impossible for me to do it without crying. After seeing tons of lactation consultants I finally decided to pump all of my sons feedings. I was given a slightly older model of the Pump in Style Original and was not very comfortable. So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month ($90 + starter kit). That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical. So I bought the PiS Advance. Although it's not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job. It's much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction. Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient, I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow. For most I'm sure the original is fantastic but if you're very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need (unless you want to shell out $90 a month. The Symphony retails at around $1250.00. OUCH!) Good Luck
