 A great success. I love all Kiddapotamus products, that I bought so far because they are well-done, thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all, they are really very handy. We went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself. Without that mat, we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out. The placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left. Best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit, eat and play - on our table. He was really happy about it. After our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag. I was really satisfied
