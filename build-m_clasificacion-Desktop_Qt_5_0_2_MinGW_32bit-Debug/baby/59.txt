 I Bought this product for my 3yr. old. At first I thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times. At first she didn't want to sit on it again &amp; she cried when I took her to the bathroom, but I told her I would sit her on it &amp; I would lift her off. Since I have been doing this she hasn't been pinched, but it took me a while for her to trust me. If you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched
