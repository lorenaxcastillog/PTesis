 I don't know what one of the reviewies was talking about.. if you read the manual, you will learn that you need to move the "leg" on the front so that the seat sits Level. That will keep your childs' head from falling forward. If that fails, go to Burlington Coat Factory and get a wedge, to prop it up more.. (to most moms I know this has been common purchase) I think that it is a very Nice and Well built car seat.. I do agree that it would be nice to have the Seat Belt tabs so that you don't need the base.. but getting an extra base isn't a bad ideal, anyways.. Remember you should always have your Local Police Department check your seats, before your child rides in it.. this is usualy a free service.. and is often held at a local Babies R U
