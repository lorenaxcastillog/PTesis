 This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility
