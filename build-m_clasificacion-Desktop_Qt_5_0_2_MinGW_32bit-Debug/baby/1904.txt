 I love this pump! Letdown occurs within thirty seconds and I can pump several ounces in about ten to fifteen minutes. I haven't yet fed my baby with the disposable bottle but I do feed her from the regular avent bottles. She had her first bottle at 2 weeks and she goes from the avent bottles to breast with no problem. I do agree though that milk leaks from the corner of her mouth, but baby's are messy anyways so I don't think that is a big deal. I would recomend this pump to any mother! I pump when her father watches her when I have appointments as well as when I go shopping so that I can feed her in the store quicker
