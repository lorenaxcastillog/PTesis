 I purchased your "Space Saver Highchair" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult. This chair works for everything! This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day. She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness. The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely. My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
