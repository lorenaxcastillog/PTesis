 I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so. I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units. The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem. Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that. I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them
