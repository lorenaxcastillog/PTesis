 I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy. I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper!

You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one
