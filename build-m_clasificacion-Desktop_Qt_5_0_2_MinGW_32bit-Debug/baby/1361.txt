 This is the second set of Doctor Browns that I have bought online. No other bottle will do now for my little one. It was suggested to me by my doctor and friend to try these bottles, since my baby had alot of gas. The only negative I had heard is that it takes a little longer to take the bottle apart, but it isn't a negative for me at all...it takes a second, and boy is it worth it. I can't recommend them highly enough.
