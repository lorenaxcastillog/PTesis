 These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy. Each has different textures, images, and something unique about it. -The yellow block has a duck on the one side that "quacks" when pressed. On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror. Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif. -The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another. -The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake. It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif. -The blue block is another rattle. It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another. -All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English). The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding). My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying "soft", "smooth", or "bumpy" and she loves the feelings. My friend's daughter, who is five months, loves to pick up and throw down the blocks. It's one of her favorite games. I'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant
