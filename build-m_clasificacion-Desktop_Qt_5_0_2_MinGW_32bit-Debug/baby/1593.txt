 I've been using this pump every day for 4 months, and I'm absolutely satisfied with it. Since my son was premature I had to pump exclusively in the beginning, and I can say without reservation that this pump works just as well, and quickly, as the hospital pump. It empties my breasts in 10 minutes, it's easy, and it travels well. Also with certain bras (not the Medela bras, as they seem to require some type of adapter) you can pump hands free by simply hooking/securing the nursing bra cups over the breast pump cups. One last comment I will make which speaks to quality, is that I ordered extra membranes and tubing to have available "just in case," but have yet to need them as the original ones are still operational. I can - and DO - recommend this pump to all nursing moms, and if you think this one is expensive, consider two things: 1. the value of your time and convenience, and 2. the total cost after you end up replacing the cheaper one when you find that it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down
