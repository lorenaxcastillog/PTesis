 I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing. Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son. I had received a free Avent nurser, so I tried it and the problem was eliminated. I bought the newborn set and some extras, not cheap, but worth it for a content baby! I was quite upset when they began leaking, then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don't tighten as much as possible, if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn, they don't leak! No gas, no leaks, happy baby
