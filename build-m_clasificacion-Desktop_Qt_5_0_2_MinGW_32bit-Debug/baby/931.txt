 We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market. Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $66! The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install. This Evenflo Gate was put together, installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven't been able to budge it one inch. Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls. Great product at a bargain price - we're ordering three more
