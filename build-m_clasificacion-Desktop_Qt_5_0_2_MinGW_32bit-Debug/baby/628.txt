 like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary). we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep. Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up. We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks. overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months
