 Great seat. It is adaptable to all toilets. There is an adjustable knob that cranks underneath to tighten it to the seat but you have to reach into the toilet to do it. I found that if you just get it close before you place it on the toilet it stays secure. You can either place it on top of the seat or lift the seat. It's easy on and off and your child can even do it him/herself. It worked so well I purchased three.
