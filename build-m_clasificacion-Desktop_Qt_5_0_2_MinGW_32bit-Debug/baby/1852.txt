 These are both Mommy & Daddy approved cloth diapers! Dad loves how easy these are to put on and figure out - no folding techniques, no guess work. Just fold over and use a snappi or pins and throw on a cover. Many times we don't even use fasteners on our more snug fitting covers. They are soft, absorbant and dry in a relatively short amount of time compared to others I have tried. They include a doubler with a single seam design to cut down on drying time. We love these
