 I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it. And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it. If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself! He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes. Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this
