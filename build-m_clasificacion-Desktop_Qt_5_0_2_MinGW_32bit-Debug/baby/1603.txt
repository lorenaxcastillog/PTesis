 I had not heard about this product/brand until my 5th baby was born. We are doing "elimination communication" with him & this potty works well for his first potty. Currently (he is almost 4 mo.old) we set the potty on the changing table & hold him. For safety reasons, we never let go of him while sitting there. When he can sit up on his own, we will sit the potty on the floor. Eventually he will out grow it. We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer, eventually he'll use that next. In the meantime the next older child is able to use it. I like that this potty is all in 1 piece. So easy to clean (no crevises to worry about). We dump the contents into the toilet. Add a little water, to the potty, from the sink (the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water) & dump rinse water into toilet. The size is nice for storing...it won't take up a lot of room. The size is nice because (eventually when he is older) he'll be able to get on & off it easily himself. I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue...but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option (After an additional item was purchased with my order, I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon). The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from. I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area. We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store. Then we would have also paid sales tax & our costs to drive there. I was pleased with this purchase through Amazon
