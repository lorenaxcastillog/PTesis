 When my son began climbing out of his crib, we cringed. We live in a townhouse and his room is a 14' x 30' space in our walkout basement. One portion of this area is used for our storage and exercise equipment, however, so we were very nervous that he would pull something down on himself. I realize that the manufacturers do not advertise this use, but it is possible to link these gates end to end in order to cover a longer stretch. The gate cleans up easily and was much less expensive (even with needing to purchase two) than the other configuration gate options. Our son is 19 mos old and 38" tall (very tall) and he has not gone over the gate- he leaves it alone! He is able to climb over many of the plastic and metal pressure gates. It did take a bit of installation time (about an hour for both gates), and you will need basic skills to install it. One other thing, my husband had to go out and buy a drill bit that was the right size for the gate install- 7/32", so be prepared. This was the best $200 I've spent on toddler products thus far
