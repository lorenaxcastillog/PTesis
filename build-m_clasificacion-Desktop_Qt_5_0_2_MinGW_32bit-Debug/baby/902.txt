 We were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler, but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night. This crib bumper does the job. When he stands on it, it collapses, so it's no help boosting him over the side. My one gripe (which I'm not sure there's a way around) is that there's a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail (the one that slides up and down). Because our little one is older, we put stuffed animals in the corners, but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught
