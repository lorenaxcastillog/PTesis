 I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller. I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online. Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places. The reviews were great & the price was right. I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it. This stroller is great! It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide! I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly. It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid. Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!). It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot. I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones. My 2 year old likes to "nap" (recline the seat) while we are walking. The back zips off, she likes to look out the back. A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt. Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller. However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket. I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff. Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!
