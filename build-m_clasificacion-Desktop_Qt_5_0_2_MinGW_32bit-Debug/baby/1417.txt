 My 9 month old daughter has never been much of a sleeper. She wakes very easily and is very active the moment she wakes up. With the bedrooms on the second floor I am now able to watch her from our first floor using this monitor and know she is safe. This monitor has also been wonderful when traveling to see relatives. I am now able to relax and enjoy our visits with the ability to watch our little darling sleep soundly. The image is clear if the camera is within 4 or 5 feet and even when we have placed the camera 10 feet or more away, it is grainy but we can still see her tiny little body enough to know she is safe. The wireless video with night vision definitely met and surpassed my expectations. The other plus to this unit is that you can buy an additional camera and switch between the two cameras using the two channels available on the handheld monitor. I definitely plan on doing this when we have our second child. The only annoyance I have experienced with this monitor, compared to my regular sony audio monitor, is that I get more interference with this one. Overall I would recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for a video monitor. I was nervous spending this much money without first seeing the quality of the picture, but I am pleased to say it has been worth every penny. Our friends and family are always so amazed by this when we show it to them. My husband and I just love being able to see our precious girl at any time and know she is safe.
