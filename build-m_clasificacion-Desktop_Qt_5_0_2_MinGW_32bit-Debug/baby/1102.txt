 When I bought this, I got the "oh great...more stuff that won't ever get used & will clutter up my house" look from my husband, which I reminded him of tonight. I did buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested in using any potty, so it did sit around for a while. But ever since she started using the potty (first hers, now ours w/ her seat), we have taken it with us everywhere. Not just for the sanitary reasons, but every bit as much for the size. We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents' houses or my husband's office potty which we're the only ones that use. The couple of times (tonight included) that we've forgotten it & she had to go in public, it is a nightmare. First there's the layers of seat covers, then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol' opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn't end up right there. Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her. Yes, I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry & I didn't have it down yet how it folded, but it was well worth it in my eyes. Bottom line- I love it, I highly recommend it, I would be totally lost without it. So worth three times (and more) what I paid for it
