 I've never written a review before and to be honest I didnt read the reviews on this item before I bought it. But I also hurt myself at work and the back pain was getting worse especially going into my third trimester. This back support made a big difference for me, it does work and I would recomend it. I only gave it 4 stars cause it does roll down a little on the sides of the back. Other than that its great and does its job
