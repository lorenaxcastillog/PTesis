 I have a independent child. SHe will not let you help her do anything so when we got the the potty training stage she had to sit on the potty like mommy. She refused to use those little potty chairs also she did not want to be lifted up and she was still to short to get up on her own by a step stool. When I found this product she was estatic. She started the day we got it and fully trained herself by the end of the week. I agree the product if a bit Flimsy and could use another go at it. All in all I do not think my daughter was in any danger using this product though. Before you buy it though make sure you have a round toilet and not an oblong or else yes it will slide around. The manufacture told me this over the phone when I called them about the issues I had read. They said it is not made for every family and I agree you have to try something to see if it will work. Unfortunatly ever child is different and has a mind of there own
