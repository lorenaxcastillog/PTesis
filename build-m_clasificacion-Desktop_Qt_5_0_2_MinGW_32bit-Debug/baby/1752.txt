 We purchased this walker for our son because he loves Elmo and Sesame Street. We love it! Our son loves pushing the "musical buttons" and spinning the red circle in the middle. It glides easily and is a breeze to get our son in and out of. The cover also comes off easily for washing, if necessary. I'm not sure what "Papa Bear Paul" was talking about, because there is no paint on our walker and there is no way our son's hand can get caught... Even if your little one doesn't enjoy Sesame Street as much as ours, you will love this walker!
