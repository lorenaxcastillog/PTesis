 I have used this on my youngest child who is just turning one. It works like a charm. Before I found Butt Paste, my fav was Balmex...now i will never use Balmex again! I cannot believe the speed in which Butt Paste clears the diaper rash. My little guy gets it so bad that he has sores on his poor little sensitive bum. It clears that up within a day. I LOVE IT! I just wish that I had it for my other two children! Buy some...you won't be sorry
