 We got this instead of the Diaper Genie because we wanted something simple and easy to use-- no turning cranks-- and something that would still be usable after the baby's out of diapers. We love the Diaper Dekor! We bought 2 refill packs before my son was born. He's 13 months now, and I'm just now shopping for more. Another reviewer mentioned problems installing refills. We did have trouble the first time, but once we'd each done it once it was a breeze. Highly recommend this product, though right now it looks like Amazon is no longer stocking the refills. That means I have to go to an actual Babies R Us store, which I hate. So, if they no longer stock, that could be a serious strike against this product. (But they do still stock the Diaper Dekor +, so I'd get that instead.
