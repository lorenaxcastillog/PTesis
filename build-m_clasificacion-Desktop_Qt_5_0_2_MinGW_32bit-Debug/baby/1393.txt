 My son is now 18 months old. I used this product from the time he was born until he was 10 months old and started using sippy cups. I don't know what I would have done without it. My husband was deployed and boiling bottles takes tons of time. My dishwasher has the sanitizing cycle, but when I used it the bottles and nipples would still have a film on them. The sterilizer kept them looking new. I also felt better knowing that they had been through the sterilizing process in the microwave. If you want to use your dishwasher, I would still recommend using this, it does not take much time at all. I used it on medula pump parts and gerber bottles, even the tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them in right. I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby, it was one of the few products that I actually used on a regular basis
