 Like the other reviewer, I needed something my daughter could splash around in while I took a shower. By the way, I'm sure neither of us leave our children unattended. We want our children to accompany us as we bathe, so I purchased this tub, as she had grown out of her other tubs. It is a great tub. It is large in size, but we have a very large shower, so it works great for us. It does work great in the regular tub too. My daughter can't wait to climb in. The only drawback is mine got a tear in the side, but we had it for a while, so I'm going to purchase another one. You also can't find inflatable tubs very easily. I highly recommend this tub
