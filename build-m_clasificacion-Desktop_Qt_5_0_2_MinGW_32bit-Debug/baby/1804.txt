 I love my clean shopper and every time I use it, I have at least one person asking me where I got it. I also buy it as baby gifts for all of my friends. It's the best purchase that I've bought. There are no strings to tie, no velcro to deal with, no snaps or buttons...it's just a piece of fabric that covers pretty much all size carts. To keep my now toddler occupied while I shop (I still use it for him) I place some goldfish either next to him, or in front of him and he eats them while I shop. Those who say there is no cushioning, that's not really the purpose of the clean shopper! It's purpose is to act as a buffer between you and the cart. If there was cushion to it and tons of bells and whistles, then it would be too bulky and too cumbersome to deal with. I can easily flip it on the cart with one hand while I've got my kid in my other. I highly recommend the clean shopper to any parent
