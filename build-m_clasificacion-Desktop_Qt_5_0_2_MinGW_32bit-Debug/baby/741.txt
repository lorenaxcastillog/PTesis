 Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my "picky mom seal of approval" wholeheartedly. Here's why. I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc. The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself. Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book
