 First of all, kudos to Amazon for having the carseat to my house in 2 days (with the Super Saver shipping, I might add). Secondly, I spent days, DAYS, looking for a new infant-toddler convertible seat. I have an 05 Trailblazer and was desparately looking for a narrow seat I could fit between 2 Graco TurboBooster seats. It's still a tight fit but it works. This was the narrowest seat I could find on the internet. The baby body pad definitely is a must since there is very little padding in the seat cover. It will work for a little while, but during the summer I'm sure the baby will not stand for that much cushion around her legs, as it will make her hot. I'll have to figure something else out at that point. The seat looks better than I expected and is about an inch less wide than the Titan. The Titan definitely doesn't work in between the two boosters. I can't see any use for the pillow, other than for looks. I'm very happy with my entire purchase
