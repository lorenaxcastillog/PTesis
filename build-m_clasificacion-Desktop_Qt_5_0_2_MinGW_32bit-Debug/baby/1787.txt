 Our son, now 3 mo's old, is a great sleeper when he's swaddled in this thing. Without it he thrashes his arms and legs and startles himself awake. With it he settles down and sleeps like a champ. We've been using it since he was a newborn. The little square of velcro doesn't hold the bottom part on well at all, but it's winter so we dress him in sleeper jammies underneath the Swaddleme anyway so it's not a big issue. When we came home from the hospital at first we tried swaddling using receiving blankets but our son wiggled right out. We're huge fans of the SwaddleMe and now give it as our standard baby shower gift.
