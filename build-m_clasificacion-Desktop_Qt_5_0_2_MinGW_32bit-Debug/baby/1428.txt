 I have large breasts - DD normally without the added bonus of the milk. My son latched on great at first, but then got a cold and could not latch properly. He got lazy with my milk supply being very good and refused to open his mouth wide enough. Needless to say breastfeeding became torture. I was almost to the point of considering formula when I came across these. Within just a few hours of wearing them, the pain decreased. The shells helped shape my nipples a little better and made it easier for my son to latch with little effort. After a full day of use, the pain has become almost non-existant. I wish I had bought these for my daughter because I might have been able to breastfeed her longer than just 9 months. These shells have made breastfeeding the wondeful bonding experience it was meant to be. My son is still a little lazy with the latch, but he is getting better and opening his mouth wider now. At first I was discouraged by the thought of needing to sanitize them every night, but I bought a microwave bottle sanitizer which makes sanitizing them a breeze. I am a very satisfied customer
