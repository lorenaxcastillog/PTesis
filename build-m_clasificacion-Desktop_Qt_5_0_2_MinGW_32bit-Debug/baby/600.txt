 I purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby. My plan was to carry it along with me whenever I would visit family and friends at their homes. I could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface. The blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches, which will accommodate adults well. I was pleased when I received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece. The quality is absolutely top notch! The surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur. The only slight con I have of the Essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side. This is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time. Otherwise I adore this blanket and highly recommend it
