 We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it. 1. It was simple to assemble. 2. It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer. 3. The air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter. 4. The toy steering wheel? She FREAKS out over it, in a good way. She *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store. Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves, I am ultra pleased. 5. The price is wonderful. We don't use the Music On The Move feature, so I can't really comment on it. I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time, and it's not hard to do, so I have no complaints there. It is a bulky item, so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky. However, the pros all outweigh the cons for me. I am extremely pleased with it
