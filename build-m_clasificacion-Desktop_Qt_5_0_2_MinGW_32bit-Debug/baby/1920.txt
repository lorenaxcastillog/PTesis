 I loved my doorway jumper. The noise I could've done without. It really is the kind that claws it's way into your head and then you hear it when you lay down to take a nap and want to sneak in the other room and toss it. But that being said, I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. My baby had a great time in her jumper and it was a fabulous way to burn of fifteen minutes. Anymore than that and I recommend an Exersaucer. I mean, how long can you just jump before it gets boring. Just put the jumper in a wide doorway and you won't have the problem of the baby hitting their hand against to doorway or whatever people complained about. And for god's sake, when your kid is over like 20 pounds move on to something else. All it all, I think this was a great investment
