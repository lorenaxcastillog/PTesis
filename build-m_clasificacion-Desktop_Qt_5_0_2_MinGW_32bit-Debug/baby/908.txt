 I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I'd have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on. My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using. I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat - I wish I had bought this seat from the get go
