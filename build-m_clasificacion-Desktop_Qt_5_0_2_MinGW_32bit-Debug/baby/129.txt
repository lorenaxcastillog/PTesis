 This product is a good idea however: 1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray. 2. Can't be put in the Micro. 3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean. 4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use a butter knife to pry open). 5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems. 6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long. Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product
