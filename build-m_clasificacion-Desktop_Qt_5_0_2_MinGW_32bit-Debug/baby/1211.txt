 These are so awesome! I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets. One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night, so I put a blanket over him - well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing. Very scary. So if anything, make sure you have more than one sleep sak.
