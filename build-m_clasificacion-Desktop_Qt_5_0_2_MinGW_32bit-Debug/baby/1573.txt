 I traveled this summer with my 18 month old. I planned to take our car seat since we were renting a car when we landed. I had a layover each way, so I was looking for a way to move him through the airport with little fuss since airlines have strict stroller policies. So, I found the Traveling Toddler and thought I would try it. It was awesome and so affordable! It was easy to use, even when I had to unhook it for security and when boarding the plane. My toddler (who was nearly 30lbs at the time) loved riding through the airport and loved the security of sitting in his car seat. Make sure your luggage has a locking extension handle so that you can push or pull your toddler. A great product! I have recommended it to many.
