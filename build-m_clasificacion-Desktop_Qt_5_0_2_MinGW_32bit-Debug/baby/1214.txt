 This pump is well worth the cost if you plan on pumping regularly. As a working mother who has been nursing for eleven months, I can honestly say that this pump is the reason I'm still able to breastfeed. I pump twice a day while at work, and this pump has never given me a problem. It has multiple speeds and vacuum settings, so it's very easy to make pumping comfortable. I've even used the battery pack to pump while driving twice in a pinch. Everything you need is included! I was even able to use other brands of bottles with the pump. I can't say enough good things about this product.
