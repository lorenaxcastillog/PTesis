 I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it. I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon. There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van. I can't wait to try it out at the mall
