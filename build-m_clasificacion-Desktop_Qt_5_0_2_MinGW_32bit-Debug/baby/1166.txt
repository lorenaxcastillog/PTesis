 I love that this is a soft tub. No hard platic egdes. The other problem I had with a traditional infant tub was that my baby outgrew it to fast. I use this tub with a bath sling for my baby that cannot sit up on her own yet. When she can sit on her own, I will use the tub alone. I have one complaint. The suction cup that is used to hang the tub fell off after minimal use and I can not get it back on
