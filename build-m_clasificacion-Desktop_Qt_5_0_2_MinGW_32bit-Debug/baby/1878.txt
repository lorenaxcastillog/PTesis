 I had a Graco car seat for my first son. He was always uncomfortable in it and he outgrew it by the time he was four months old. He was also uncomfortable in the accompanying stroller and I hated trying to get this heavy stroller in and out of my car. The whole travel system was a waste of money. After a lot of research I bought the Combi Connection car seat with the Flash EX Universal Car Seat Carrier for my second son. I have been very happy with both. My second son is almost 10 months old and I'm still using this car seat. He has been very comfortable in it, and I'm dreading having to give up the convenience of having him in an infant carrier. My son isn't exceptionally small. He is light for his age - he's in the 25th percentile for weight, but he's tall - 90th for height. I am completely shocked by the previous reviewer who thought this car seat was too small. The only reason I gave this car seat 4 stars instead of 5 is because the canopy isn't very sturdy. Other than that it is highly recommended
