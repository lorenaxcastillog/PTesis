 I bought Gerber comforthold bottles and Playtex Ventair natural shape bottles ,there were stage ones. My son didnt like Gerber's nipples since the nipples are too short and he hardly get any thing. i end up buying more PLaytex bottles and threw away Gerber's nipples and use PLaytex nipples for gerber bottles as well since they fit Gerber Bottles.Another thing i like about these bottles , obviously he got less air after feeding him i didnt have to burp him like i used to with other bottles. the shape of bottles are easy to hold to me and my baby as well. NO LEAKS RECOMMENDED!!!
