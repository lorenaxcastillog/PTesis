 My 4 month old has enjoyed her Pupsqueak for a month now. She can lay in her bassinet up to an half hour staring at her new buddy. The bright colors and textures seem to facinate her. The puppy's ears contain that "noisy" paper, but that's ok. Sometime's that's how I know that she's awake via the child monitor. She isn't old enough to press his nose make him bark, but I'm sure once she's old enough she'll enjoy that feature too. I highly recommend this product
