 The basic idea is great and the ease of assembly is nice - no tools needed. We have used it with all the grandchildren (6) and one nephew. I think it needs some design improvements: (1) the straps which are used to hold it to a chair would be better if there were a strap which went from front to back, not just around the back of the seat. One of the grandkids seems unable to sit still and I keep expecting him to tip over the chair because it tends to slide sideways in the front. (2) the tray is designed for a slim child. On one side, the tray fits a finger like protusion into a hole. On the other side, there are 2 places to attach the tray in slots. Only when the tray is in the innermost position, is it aligned directly in front of the child and there isn't a great deal of tummy room. If you move the tray to the outer position (available on one side only), the tray is cocked at an angle and it still probably wouldn't accomodate a child with a larger stomach. (3) the belts to hold the child need to be longer. Fortunately for us, all the grandkids and nephew are slim. At least so far
