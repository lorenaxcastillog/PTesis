 You can see in one of the pictures above I needed to cover a 20ft area to keep the dog out of my young son's play area, he's only five months old. I purchased two of these gates, connected them together and voila, you have a ready made wall. The look is great and goes with any decor. Unlike the one review below I have had no problems with it coming out of the wall. You have to have it anchored into a stud just as you do with anything you screw into the wall. I have ran into it a few times not realizing the gate was latched and it didn't budge. I feel good knowing that if I have to step out of the room for a minute my son is safe. Everything was easy to install and connecting the two gates together is a breeze. I recommend this gate to everyone. If you want peace of mind buy it. And if you have a babies'r'us around you they sell them there
