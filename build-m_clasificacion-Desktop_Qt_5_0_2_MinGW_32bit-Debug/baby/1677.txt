 Having lost a neice to SIDS, I was very nervous that my baby would stop breathing at night. This co-sleeper got me through the first 5 months because I could reach over and check her breathing any time during the night. I could sleep or nap right next to her without fear of rolling on her. She would not sleep in it until she was 3 weeks old, but after that, she was just fine. I would definitely use it again if I have more children
