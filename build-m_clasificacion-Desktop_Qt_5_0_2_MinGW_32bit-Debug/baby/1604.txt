 This potty has been great for my daughter. She started using it when she was 15 months old (3 months ago) and seems comfortable on it. I love the simple design and ease of cleaning. I also love that my daughter will use it! The only problem we have faced with this potty is sliding. Our daughter cannot sit on it without help because there is no traction on the bottom of it. We've tried various methods to fix this and it's not much of an issue now
