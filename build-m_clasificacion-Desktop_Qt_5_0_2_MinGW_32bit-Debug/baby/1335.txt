 This product is better then most. Now I am sure if you want to pay over$100.00 for a monitor it MAY be better but for the price and what I need it for it works GREAT!!!! I love the choice of channels and that if the baby is sleeping I do not have to hear static and hope I can hear if he is chocking. If the baby moves this monitor picks it up. Also the light indication is a plus. Great monitor! I would recommend this product
