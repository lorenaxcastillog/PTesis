 I tried several types of nursing pads and found these to be by far the most comfortable. I never have a problem with leakage or "fuzzies" left behind by the pads. I actually had to throw away the box of johnson and johnson pads i had bought because they were so itchy and fuzzy, and i found the thinner types of pads to be too flimsy for me. While the avent pads are bulky, because i am not back into my normal slim-fitting clothes yet, i haven't had a problem with the pads showing through.
