 Like the other moms who have reviewed this product, my son had difficulties with the Avent bottles. I have what seems to be a million Avent bottles from my first pregnancy and my newest son could not handle them. He would choke, spit, up, have gas, and much of the milk leaked from the sides of his mouth - soaking him and who ever was feeding him! My son loved his soothie paci (it's the ONLY one he would take), so I decided to try the bottles. He has absolutely no problems switching between the breast and these bottles. I haven't had any leaking problems as mentioned by other moms.
