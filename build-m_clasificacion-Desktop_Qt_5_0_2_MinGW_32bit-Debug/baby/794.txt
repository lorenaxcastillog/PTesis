 We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it! I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about. If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems. The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart. The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily. We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly! We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up. He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe. The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it. This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway. The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't! We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers). We haven't had any problems at all. Anyway, I highly recommend it..
