 I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue.
