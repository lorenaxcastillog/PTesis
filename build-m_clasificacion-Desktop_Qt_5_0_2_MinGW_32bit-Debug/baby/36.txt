 For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work.
