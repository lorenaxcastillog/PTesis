 I shopped for months to find a 3 in 1 that was of good quality but wasnt to pricey. We just moved our 7 month old son from our bed to this crib. He transitioned nicely. It arrived 1 day later than projected. It was fairly easy to put it together (I did it by myself, my hubby is mechanically challenged). I did break a plastic piece as I assembled it. The company sent a replacement, free of charge. I received the replacement in 4 days. The only thing I could complain about is the latching system, it works fine, but I feel they could do a better design
