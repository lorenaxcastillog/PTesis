 A friend of mine bought this item for me and at first I thought that "wasted" her money. I noticed that she bought it for me in L-XL and of course I thought this will never ever fit me, after all my pre-pregnancy size was a 4. Well, I was sooo wrong! Into my 3rd trimester, I developed discomfort in my lower abdomen and back. I decided to try this belt and it was a awesome! I've been able to continue working out, walking, etc... because of this belt. I love it!! My only suggestion is to buy the bigger size.
