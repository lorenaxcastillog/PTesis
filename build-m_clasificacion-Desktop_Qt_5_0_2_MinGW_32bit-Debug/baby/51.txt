 This product is absolutely useless. Save your money. The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it. In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever. So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around. So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout
