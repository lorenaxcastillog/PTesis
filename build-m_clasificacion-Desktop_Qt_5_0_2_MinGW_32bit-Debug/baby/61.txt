 For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got. First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position. Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working. Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item. While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing
