 Like the other reviewer, I purchased two of these pads for use with my 23 year old disabled child. My daughter wears a Depends and we supplement with disposable pads (which are very thin), and I am thrilled with the quality of the Soaker product. They wash well (cool water, cool tumble dry)and are well worth the money. The appear to be very well made - hopefully they will last a long while, but at this price it won't be a hardship to replace them. I highly recommend this product
