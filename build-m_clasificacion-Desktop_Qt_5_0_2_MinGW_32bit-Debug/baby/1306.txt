 This is a great pump! At first I was looking at pumps that cost around the $70 range. I am so glad that I decided to spend the extra money! My daughter was not too keen on breastfeeding and it just turned into a horrible experience that I'd like to forget. The hospital that I was in provided the Medela pump. Ouch!!! My breasts were sooo sore from using that thing, it was not comfortable at all! The cups for the breast is this hard plastic and when it would pump, my poor nipples were getting so sore and then i had to use nipple cream to make them feel better. I actually could not have anything on my breasts while i was at the hospital because they were so sore. It made me so grouchy and I just let everything hang out. I didn't care who came in the room!!! When I came home and started using the Playtex pump, it was such a relief! The cups for the breasts have a soft rubbery feel to them and they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping. The 5 speed/suction controls are very nice to have. It does come with a storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy's. I had to buy 2 extra storage kits so that I had enough contraptions to use for storing milk. I really hope that makes sense! And then there's the liners. I had liners coming out of my ears! I guess that's how Playtex makes their money, you have to buy tons of liners (and don't forget the storage kits). The pump is a little loud when the suction is set higher. I used it for 4 months and everything worked great. I definitely recommend this pump. I would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is spending the extra money on storage kits and the countless number of liners you have to buy. BUT... It is a world of difference between Medela and Playtex.
