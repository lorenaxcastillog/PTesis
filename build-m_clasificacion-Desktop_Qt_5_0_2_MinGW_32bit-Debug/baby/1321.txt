 I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece. They love it too!! This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part. Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes. My 13 month old loves it (and so does my 4 year old). He is just mesmerized by it when he's tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he's done sleeping. I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet. I wanted to set the record straight. The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be? I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it's just fine. I highly recommend this mobile
