 We looked at tons of baby seats when our son outgrew his infant seat. I wanted something that would still fit as he got bigger. It has the added bonus of being airline certified, so if we ever need to fly somewhere I know that he will be buckled up safely. My husband says that it's a dream to install and we can switch it easily to grandpa's car. I also like the peace of mind knowing that it has a high safety rating. It was very expensive, but I believe that it's worth it and it is good up to 100lbs, so I plan to use it for several years.
