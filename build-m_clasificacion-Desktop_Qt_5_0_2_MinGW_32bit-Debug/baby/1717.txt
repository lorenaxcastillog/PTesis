 I bought this booster seat because we just bought a new table and chairs, and our previous hard plastic booster seat had rubbed some of the paint off of our old chairs. This seat is wonderful! It is soft enough to be comfortable, and my three year old can climb into it by herself without it sliding around on the chair. It rests against the wood of the chairs without damaging them in any way. I highly recommend it for the older toddler, but you might want something with a little more support for a younger child
