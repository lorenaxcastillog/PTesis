 Limited space in our townhome, and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us. This is our "highchair". Make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table. The chair arms (attachments) may not clear the lip. Strong, sturdy, easy to clean. Knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about. Great travel drawstring bag. Great price!!! Great product. If you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that shouldn't be forced, this seat will work out for you. Something for the manufacturers, if they read these comments... personnal prefrence. The harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat. Very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat, and its 5:00 in the morning
