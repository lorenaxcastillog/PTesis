 What a Godsend this has been. Our daughter is 3 years old and we take this thing everywhere! Sure, we keep Potty-toppers with us, but sometimes that just isn't enough. This On The Go Potty is far better than any porta-potty or gross outdoor park restroom. We have used this potty at the park, while making rounds at build/construction sites, at baseball games, even in the parking garage of our hockey rink! Our daughter can use it just about anywhere. It's small size allows her to use it discreetly and comfortably. If you EVER venture more than 30 seconds from a clean toilet, you NEED this. Then you'll wonder how you ever got by without it
