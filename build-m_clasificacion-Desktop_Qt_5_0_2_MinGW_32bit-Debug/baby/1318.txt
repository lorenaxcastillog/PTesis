 We used this as a play mat before our baby was eating solids. He liked looking at the colorful images and it kept his drool off of the carpet. We moved it under his highchair when he started eating and it helps keep baby from staining the carpet. I wish it was bigger though, so it would protect a larger area. And I wish it was thicker. Since our dining room is carpeted, the wheels of the highchair push the mat into the carpet and stretch it a bit. This leaves crescent-shaped bumps or indentations on the mat. Overall it is a good product, especially for the price
