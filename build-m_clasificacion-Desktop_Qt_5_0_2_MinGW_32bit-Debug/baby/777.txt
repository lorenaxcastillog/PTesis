 When it comes to using this for your children you'd have to first know what your needs are. I can't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing; it would be more like a psychological barrier. But depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they shouldn't have. I ordered this to use for my puppy. In my case I don't have the problem of her pushing on it so I can't say how long it would last through that. For this price I was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install.
