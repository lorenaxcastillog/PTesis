 I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then. I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year. I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused. The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time. The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield. My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option. I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap. I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand. I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off. I still very much like this product as it gets the job done
