 I read some other reviews that were poor, but I disagree. My son loves this toy. He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room. It plays music continually for 12 minutes. So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out. We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy. However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons.
