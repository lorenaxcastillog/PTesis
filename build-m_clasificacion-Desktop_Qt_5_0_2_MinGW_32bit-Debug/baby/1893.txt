 As any pregnant woman knows, at some point during gestation it becomes nearly impossible to sleep comfortably. When you can't sleep on your back, you can't sleep on your stomach, and your only choice is to balance on your side with your belly slowly pulling you off balance, your body actually gets pretty tired. After getting very little, uncomfortable sleep for some weeks, I searched desperately for relief. I intended to purchase the snooggle full length body/pregnancy pillow since they had it on Target online where my baby registry was. Some time passed and I decided to go straight to Target in person and get the snoogle only to find it was not there. BUT, the Boppy pillow WAS and I got it right away. I have to say that it is one of the BEST products I bought during my pregnancy. I would not have had a good nights sleep without it. Some people complain that the preggo pillows they have bought take up too much room in the bed, but this one is nicely shaped to hug your body and cushion where it is needed without too much extra bulk. The slipcover that comes with it is very pretty and easy to take off to wash. It also comes with a zippable pillowcase that you can fold the whole thing into to make one nice round pillow. I am still using this pillow after my son was born, since it folds nicely in different ways and makes a nice pillow just to recline on. Definitely a MUST HAVE for any pregnant woman! You WON'T regret it
