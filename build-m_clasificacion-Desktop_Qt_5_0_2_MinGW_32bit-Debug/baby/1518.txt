 We purchased this stroller to take to WDW. We were pleased with this stroller. We were able to easily collapse to get on and off buses, it is very easy to manuever. Despite it's light weight, I was able to put three to four jackets & one bag on the back of it without it turning over -- even without my three yr old in the stroller! (It did tip over once or twice, it just took a lot more than I expected it would to tip.) I didn't have problems with the handles being too short (I'm 5'7"), but my husband did (6'3"). But overall, the only way it could have been better would to be to have one little cup holder. I've had three different umbrella strollers and this is by far the BEST one I've owned. It's ability to maneuver through crowds and turn quickly is simply excellent! For the price, I would not / could not have purchased a better umbrella stroller
