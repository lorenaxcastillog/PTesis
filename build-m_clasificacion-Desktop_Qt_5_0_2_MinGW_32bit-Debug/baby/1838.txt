 I have been using the Avent On-the-Go pump set for over 4 1/2 months now, and I think the pump is very easy to use. I find it very comfortable, and am easily able to pump 4 or more ounces in under 10 minutes. I used a Medela electric pump (I do not know which model) once and found the Avent Isis manual pump allowed me to pump more milk in less time. The *only* thing I would suggest is for new mothers (and their significant others) to practice assembling the pump a few times prior to the arrival of their little one. I found that in the first week of my baby's life I was too overwhelmed to sit down and read the Avent instructions on how to put the pump together correctly.
