 These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry. I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra, and I didn't have a huge leakage problem, so I changed the foam twice a day. The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it. I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them. Bottom line: the relief was worth any minor inconvenience
