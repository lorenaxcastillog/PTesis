 After using the Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat for 4 months, I purchased two more mats. This is the best seat protector I found for several reasons: - It doesn't smell. I had to return everything I had bought at Babies R Us due to a heavy rubber smell that never went away even after airing the products for a week. - It's made of two pieces so it can be used in stages. Use the bottom piece only when using a rear-facing infant seat, or both pieces when using a front-facing car seat. - It's made of two pieces so it fits any height car seat. I have a Britax car seat which is really tall. The other seat protectors did not reach all the way to the top of my SUV's seat, so the car seat rested directly on the leather, but with this seat protector, I could raise the back piece as high as I needed it to fully protect my SUV's seat. - It's thick enough that even after months of use, there's no marks on the SUV's leather seats. - It has indentations in the bottom portion to accommodate car seats using the latch system. A note on the height issue: A friend of mine bought the Duomat 2-In-1 Car Seat Mat, which he found to be very nice as well and it did not smell. He had to return it however due to the fact that the mat was not as high as the seat of his Honda Odyssey, and his Britax Marathon car seat at the very top rested directly on the Honda seat with no protector in between
