 Our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home. When we tried to transition him to the crib, he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly. As he outgrew the stroller, we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib (lots of attempts - not an easy task!!). He's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the Sleep Nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized SwaddleMe at night. He loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly. The Sleep Nest is small enough to be cozy, but large enough for him to move comfortably. It fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go
