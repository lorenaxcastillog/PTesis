 We love this seat. Our son is almost 10 months old and we have been using it since he was 4 months old!! I was going to go buy a highchair when we needed one- but we never needed one!! I love this chair. You can adjust the height as he grows; the whole thing goes in the dishwasher; the swing out tray is wonderful. He is very safe and secure when buckled in. We have never had a problem with him kicking off the tray and he's a very active baby. I would highly recommend this seat- especially if you do not have a very big kitchen and a highchair would be so cumbersome. Just make sure it is securely attached to your kitchen chair!
