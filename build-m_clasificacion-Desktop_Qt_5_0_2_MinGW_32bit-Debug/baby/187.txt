 We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it. In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it. Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months. While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him. He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller. The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well. The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support. Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller. With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back. She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything. She would much prefer to sit in the front. We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it. There is no cup holder or tray for the parents. It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy. So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now
