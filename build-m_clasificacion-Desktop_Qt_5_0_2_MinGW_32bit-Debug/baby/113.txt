 Shoppers beware: The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders: 1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled. 2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out. 3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them
