 LOVE that this stroller is so light weight. I purchased this stroller for our second child. I wanted something super light since I would have 2 kids to trek around with. I was tired of the big Evenflo travel system I had from our first child. I can take this in and out of the car easily with one hand. I've never had an issue with the steering as others have stated. There were some complaints about the harness. It sounds to me that they just did not read the directions. I use the 5 point harness everytime I put my daughter, now 20 months, in the stroller. The harness is simple to use and is very secure. The stroller hood is easy to keep clean/dry. Any liquid that drops on the fabric just beads up, you can wipe or flick it off. I even ran over this stroller with our minivan and it works as well as the day we bought it. The snack tray bent, but that was the only dammage to stroller. I was easily able to order a replacement. The only complaint I have is the lousy adult cup holder hanging from one side of the handlebar. It doesn't stay in place, and my water bottle slips out easily. I did see this stroller at Sea World last weekend. I saw a Peg Aria with a tray and cup holder that extends to each side of the stroller just below the handlebar. Check with Peg. I would definately puchase this stroller again
