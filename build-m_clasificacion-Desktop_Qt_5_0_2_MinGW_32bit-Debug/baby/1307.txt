 I love this pump. I've tried Medela and hospital grade pumps and this is by far the most comfortable pump ever. I'm the proud mom of almost 5 month old twin girls and I used hospital pump which got me bleeding on second day. Problem, flangies were too small for me and they didn't have anything larger. Embrace is the right size for me and after getting home from the hospital on the 3rd day I have been married to my pump 24/7. We had latching problems so I was never able to fully nurse my babies, but with Embrace I'm still going strong after 5 months and pump 50-60oz/day. I have had NO problems with my pump, no motor failures, no tube problems, nothing. I've pumpped with it like I said, almost 5 months on average 5 times a day. It may be a bit noisy... my husband calls it a respirator :) But I would not switch my pump to Medela or any other for anything. I'm sorry some of you have had bad experience with your Embrace, not everybody's body is made the same and not every manufacturing lot is the same, I'm sure of that. This pump has been a life saver for me and my girls and I have no plans on stopping pumping. I started with the 4oz bottles that came with the system and eventually graduated pumping into Dr.Brown's 8oz bottles. I love the fact that I can pump directly to both narrow and widemouth bottles. I've never cleaned my pump nor bottles in the dishwasher, but wash them by hand. I started working when my girls were 9 weeks old, so I guess I can be called a WAHM (I'm a web developer and work from home) and I didn't notice any drop in supply during the work day compared to the weekend. WORTH EVERY CENT! Try, compare... Not every Medela user is happy with their pump either. There is no product out there that is going to satisfy everybody. Embrace just is better
