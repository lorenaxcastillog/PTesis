 We have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece. They are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market. They are made well, stand up to a lot of washing, and are soft and comfortable for baby. The dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch. Note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months, not for a newborn. We started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets. Two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night- all you need over pj's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable. A great night's sleep for all!
