 MY baby had slpt in our bed since the day we brought her home from the hospital. But I my husband and I were always afaid of squishing her and she tended to want to sleep glued on to me wich wasn't to comfortable let alone safe. I was searching on line one day and came across this on another web site I instantly knew that this was what I wanted. I shopped around and found a different brand of this type of bed and ordered it, it does not have a sleep positioner but i amhappy about that since my baby hated hers. and mine also has a foot rest on the botton so that the baby cant oooze out. The only problem with this is we have a queen size bed and there is barley enough room in it for all of us, but we make due and this would fit great in a king size bed. My little girl loves this thing and sleeps better through the night in it. and she can sleep close to me with being practally on top of me, I would recomned this to any parent who wants to co-sleep with their baby but wants a little piece of mind. as for people who are against co-sleeping then this is not a product for yo
