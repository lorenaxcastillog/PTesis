 I own this blanket and just bought another! I brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park. It was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me, my daughter, and all of our stuff. A few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too. My baby spits up quite a bit, especially during tummy time, so I decided to buy another one to use in the house. It cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth. Great investment
