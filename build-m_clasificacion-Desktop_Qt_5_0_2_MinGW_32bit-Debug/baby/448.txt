 I picked this monitor after reading many reviews. The reviews didn't lie. This monitor does great on distance. I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors. The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor. I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound. I could hear him grunt even! I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss. You're given many channels in order to find the right strength. I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs). I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked. Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing). Great product, strongly recommend. My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great. This monitor is the right choice for the average household. Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
