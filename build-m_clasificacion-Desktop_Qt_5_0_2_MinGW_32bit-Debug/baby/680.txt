 we bought this when my daughter was newborn, and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well, now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel. She has always loved it, in the snow and on the ground and on picnics, its great, a lot better than plastic wheels, the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move. Weve really liked it so far, except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby, its GREAT. the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on
