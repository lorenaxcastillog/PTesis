 I bought this for my four month old daughter. Within two weeks she was already sitting up unassisted for more than a few seconds because of the Bumbo. It satisfies it's job of being a sitting aid, and the baby enjoys it for about 7-8 minutes at a time. First, I was a bit hesitant about buying this due to it's high price, but I gave in and did. Am I glad that I did? I think I could have saved my money and used my baby bouncer for the same purpose.
