 Our son was born in the middle of September. During the first day we definitely had problems. The day after having him my lactation consultant suggested these and hubby ran to babysrus to buy these. I wore them for an hr before feeding time and our son truly fed for the 1st time and was able to stay latched for the entire 40mins that he took. They were effective immediately and these were such a godsend. You dont have to worry about the nipple confusion etc that you might have with a shield, and previous review is right, most of the time I would easily forget they were there and would have to check to make sure. Also they are not noticeable under clothing so you can wear these anywhere. I also wore these when I had leakage problems and I never had to worry about leaking through my clothes in public or something. Our son is now 4mnths old and I havent had to use these since he was 2mnths old. I'm saving these for any future kids of ours and I recommend them to anyone with inverted or flat nipples
