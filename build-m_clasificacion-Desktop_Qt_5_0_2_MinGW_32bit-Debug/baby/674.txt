 I am 5'5 with a large bust size and had a 7lbs 7 oz baby. It took a couple times to find the most comfortable way for me to wear it but after that I have had no problems with it. My son will get in there and go straight to sleep and I have never felt he was going to suffocate. The pockets are a major plus and now since it is cold and flu time of the year I like it because all the touchy and coughing people can not touch him with any germs they may have since he is completly covered up. He is still laying down in it so I don't know how it will work with him sitting up.
