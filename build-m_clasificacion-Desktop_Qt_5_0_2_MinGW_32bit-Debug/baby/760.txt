 These are the best pads for the task...the ultra thin pads are great for during the day...they dont leak and are very breathable...the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking. i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads. the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar. try every kind you get...samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best.
