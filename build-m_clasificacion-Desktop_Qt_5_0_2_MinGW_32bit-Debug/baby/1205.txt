 After reading the reviews, both good and bad, I could not wait to get this product and when it came today I had to try it out. The stars are great. It is just a nightlight so if you are expecting something elaborate of the night sky...think again. It is hard over the shell and the rest of the body is plush, but it is not a toy. Just cute to look at. I think all of the light settings are great. Blue is the brightest and amber is the dimmest, but they all look great in a dark room. If you want a fancy nightlight...go for it! Worth all the mone
