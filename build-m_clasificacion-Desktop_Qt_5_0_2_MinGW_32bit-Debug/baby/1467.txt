 This product has been a lifesaver. My newly 2 year old had learned to jump out of his crib and is just not ready for a bed yet. I bought this and within 25 minutes it was completely put together and put on the crib. I did it myself and found it simple to do. I haven't had a problem since. The only downfall I have is that the zipper will wake him if I go in there and want to cover him with a blanket. I found changing the sheets easy-the mattress fit right thru the opening and I switched the sheets no problem. This product is excellent
