 We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents. However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably. So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food. We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy. We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food
