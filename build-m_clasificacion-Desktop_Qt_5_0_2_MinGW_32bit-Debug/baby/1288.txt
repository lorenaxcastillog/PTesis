 I purchased this sheet two years ago for my son's Graco Pack 'n Play. No, it isn't waterproof- but I have NEVER come across a SHEET that was. However, I recommend purchasing a BRU Especially for Baby Brand Waterproof Pad to go underneath it (Just like you would for a real mattress!). When placed over the pad, the sheet lies flat, and instantly your PNP mattress is PROTECTED! This is the only sheet I would recommend to use in a Graco Pack 'N Play because it is MADE JUST FOR THIS! Port-a-Crib sheets are different, and don't lie as flat or fit as snug- therefore, I don't feel they are as safe. This sheet is easy to launder and does not shrink- it will fit every time! I liked this sheet so much that I'd buy it again- and I DID! I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased a second one for my second PNP!
