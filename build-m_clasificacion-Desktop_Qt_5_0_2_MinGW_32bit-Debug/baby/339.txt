 This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace
