 I used this tub with my son from newborn on through to early 2's. It was very convenient to give him his bath at our sink so we stuck with it for quite a while. The nice thing about this tub is it is deep enough for a newborn to recline and stay warm as well as a toddler to have splashing water. I never used the hammock so I have no comment. The tub held up nicely and the pads on the bottom stayed stuck down the entire time even with cleaning products
