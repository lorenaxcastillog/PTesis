 My mother-in-law bought these for my daughter. At first, I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be, but my daughter took to them right away. In the beginning, she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise, but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures. She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up. They won't entertain her for hours, but she's always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day
