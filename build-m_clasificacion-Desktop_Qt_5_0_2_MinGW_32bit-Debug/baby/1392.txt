 Bought this set in black for our Maclaren Ryder stroller and have had great success. You do need to test the positions before you tighten the clamps to make sure they won't interfere with closing of the stroller. We placed one clamp on the side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or the snack tray depending which we had attached at the time, and the other clamp on one of the stroller handles so we could attach the cup holder or water bottle holder for our use. We spent a few days at Disney World and had no problems with the attachments falling off or knocking into things. You do need to remember to remove and store the attachments before folding the stroller so they don't get knocked off and lost. We haven't used the S-hooks yet, they do feel and look a little flimsy, but they'd probably be okay for light bags
