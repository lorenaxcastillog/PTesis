 The clamp that hangs from the door frame is very secure, and the strap is adjustable for the baby's height. It's rather hard to get the baby into it, however. It's also rather large and bulky and my baby gets his hands stuck in the leg holes. I wish it didn't have the metal frame and fit more snugly around his body so he felt more free to jump around. This problem will probably not be such an issue when he gets bigger, though. Overall, it's a good product
