 We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel. It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car. I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars. I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone
