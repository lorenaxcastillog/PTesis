 This bottle solved these problems for us: Gas Spit Up Milk leaking out of baby's mouth low birth weight(she just wouldn't eat much) My baby started out life as a breastfeeder and at 2 weeks was diagnosed with a milk allergy. She was not gaining weight. She was switched to soy. I didn't want to try these bottles. I tried Gerber, Evenflo, Playtex, Avent. My mom read that they helped with colic and so she brought me one. I used that one bottle for two days until I could get to the store. Since then, I have retried all of those other bottles. She started eating less and losing more of it out the side of her mouth and spiting up again. This is her favorite. So it is worth it to me
