 When I had my daughter I had no clue where to begin with breast pads so I bought several different types. A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite. I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads. I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands. It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable. I didn't have any chaffing like with most others. Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive.
