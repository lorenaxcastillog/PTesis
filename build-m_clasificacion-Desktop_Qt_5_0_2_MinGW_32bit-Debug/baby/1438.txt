 Regular training seats you place on top of an adult size toilet just were not stable enough for my son. Add the fact that one of our toilets is oval and it was a BAD fit. Also add that he's a very big boy and regular seats would allow him to pee right over the little pee catcher (don't know the official term ;) for that part). He'd say, "Mommy - I fall" and didn't want to try. This seat works great because you can adjust it to make it fit with more stability
