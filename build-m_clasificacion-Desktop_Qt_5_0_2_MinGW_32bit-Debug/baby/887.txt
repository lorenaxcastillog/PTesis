 I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005. It has held up really well. My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep. I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever "made" the bed. Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees. The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib. I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection. You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone.
