 I received this as a gift for my shower. I had forgotten all about it. My baby was extremely collicky, and wouldn't sleep at night. I would be up until 3am EVERY NIGHT! After about a month, I was desperate...I pulled out the swaddle me and gave it a shot. Well...she slept all night, I jumped out of bed at 7am and ran into her room, I thought something was wrong! She was SNORING!!! Had I known that this product was a Godsend, I would've paid $100 bux for it!!! She is 4 months old now, and I've been swaddling her for the last 3 months, she sleeps 8-10 hours straight!! I just wish they made it in size medium. She's in the large now, and it's a bit big. She manages to get her arms out. But I love it anyway!!! She'll grow into it. BUY IT!
