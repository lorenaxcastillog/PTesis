 I've not bought one of these yet, but after seeing it in person, we're definitely getting one in a couple months for our new baby. It's very small, great for our 1bdr NYC apartment. People that have reviewed this previously don't mention the incredible amount of space this would save in a small living area. Since we don't have an extra room for our child, this will be perfect. Seems much more sturdy than any of the wood portable cribs. As for the particle board under the mattress, you could very easily reinforce it with another board, or metal braces. You can remove the wheels if, at a later time, it worries you that your toddler would be standing in the bed. It has 2 adjustable heights. Seems really good to me
