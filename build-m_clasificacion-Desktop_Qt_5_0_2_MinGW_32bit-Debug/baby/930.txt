 This gate has some good points and just one negative. Pros - good price, easy to operate. Mine are very easy on the batteries, I replace them about every 2 months. They are located on the kid's bedroom doorways, about 8' apart from each other. We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs, and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister's room when she wants some quiet time. For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both. So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other, then set up the second gate seperately. I have never had them malfunction following these steps. Cons: I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door. I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough. It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back. We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this. But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems. It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood. I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down. The also should be a little taller IMO, and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open. Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed..a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed. This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it. Overall, 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching. Good price though and it is put together well
