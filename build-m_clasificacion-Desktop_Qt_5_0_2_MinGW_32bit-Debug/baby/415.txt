 First, I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby's sleep better. That I cannot deny. Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking. However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk. I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters. She could have easily suffocated! This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had). Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product. I have to tell you that that is not quite the case. Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated. The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either. If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it. I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down. As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters.
