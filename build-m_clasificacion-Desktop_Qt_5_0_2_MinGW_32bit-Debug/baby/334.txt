 the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new "channel" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one
