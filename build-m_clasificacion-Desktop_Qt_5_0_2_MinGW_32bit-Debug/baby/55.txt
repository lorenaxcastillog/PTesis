 If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you. Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting). I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not. She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well. Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter
