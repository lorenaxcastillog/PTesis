 My granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs , she had no problem with the soothie bottle , the pacifer she loves , the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding , like the little cups to hold the powder formual .Haven't had a problem with the bottles leaking . Love the ones with the designs of Winnie-the-Pooh on them , wish they came in the 3 bottle set , also wish you could buy the little snack( formula ) containers seperately not just in the large sets . Would recommend for any baby .
