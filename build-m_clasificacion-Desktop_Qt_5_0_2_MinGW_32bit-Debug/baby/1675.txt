 These things are great! If you have a colicky baby (and most of us do to some extent) read "the Happiest Baby on the Block" and get the SwaddleMe baby wrap. Yes you can learn how to swaddle with a blanket, but these are SO much easier, in part because how many LARGE square blankets do you actually see out there (required for swaddling)? Only downside for us is that the velcro loop section wears out in about 2-3 weeks depending on usage levels. Not a huge problem, since the need for swaddling usually ends around 3 months, and they aren't expensive. It would also be nice to have the loop section larger, to accommodate longer skinny babies. Our son is a bit too long for the small, but WAAY to skinny for the Large
