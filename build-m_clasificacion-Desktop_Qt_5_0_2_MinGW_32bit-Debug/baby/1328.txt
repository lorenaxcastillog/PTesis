 If we would have known this was available earlier, we wouldn't have bought the smaller play-yard that we replaced this with. Our son, who is 21 months and is in the 90 percentile for height and weight,just loves this play-yard and we love the fact that he is safer and more comfortable than ever before. We are very pleased with the quality, the size, the portability, and the color scheme. This is by far the best money we have spent for a child related item. We highly recommend this item and we are confident that you will be pleased with it just as we are.
