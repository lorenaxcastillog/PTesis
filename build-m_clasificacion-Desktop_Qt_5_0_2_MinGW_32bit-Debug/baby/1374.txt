Mom's Commentary;This potty is really fantastic!I bought two of them-one for upstairs and one for downstairs.I especially like the white one because it gives a clean look.All the other pottys I've tried either had lots of grooves and peices that were hard to clean and deal with or were only one piece which we would have a whole "operation clean-up" after each use. As my child mentioned,she can spill it in the toilet and then clean it with CLOROX WIPES.(she calles them "potty wipes"*) The rubber strip on the bottom makes it stay where its put.I also bought the matching stool so that she can wash her hands and that stool proves to be great as well!I think that this potty deserves five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
