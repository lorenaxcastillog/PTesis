 My husband and I adore this monitor. It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great. We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away. The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up. I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house. I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long! You can defintely trust this monitor
