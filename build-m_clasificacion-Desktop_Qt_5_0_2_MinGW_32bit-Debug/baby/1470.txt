 This is THE perfect chair. We love it. My son is 6 months and he seems really confortable in it. I'm sure he'll be fine for the next few years. It's very convenient with all its different positions. I can feed him in the living room or at the kitchen table. He can be vertical to eat solids, a little less to drink his bottle and laying back if he falls asleep. It's very easy to clean as well, and easy to fold. It's just PERFECT. Nothing wrong about it.
