 I was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry. I am so glad I did. I have only had to empty it about every 6-7days and it is simple and odor free. Even when full there is no odor! I didnt need to put in a refill for 3months. the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts. in comparison, its cheaper! I would recommend this to anyone
