 I bought this tent to keep the cat out of the portable playard. It does the job very well. I only gave it 4 stars because the clips that attach the tent to the playard don't fit very well on the side when I have the bassinet part of the playard inside. The bassinet has clips of it's own that go on the side and the tent's clips have to fit over the bassinet's clips. Sometimes the tent's clips slide off. One of them actually broke. I think that it will work much better once I'm no longer using the bassinet part of the playard
