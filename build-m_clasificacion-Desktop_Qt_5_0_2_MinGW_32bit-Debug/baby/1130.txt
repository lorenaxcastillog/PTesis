 I must agree that I tried the others - from cheap to expensive - before finally getting to the Dr.Brown bottles. I tried others that had the same claims - even a few gimmicks that would work in theory (VentAire). I have only found success with the Dr.Brown bottles. These bottles will sometimes leak - until you get the hang of them and keep the inner-tube empty and the collar on not-so-tight. Usually a gentle twist of the collar will empty the inner-tube and then you can twist it back on...but not too tight. The disks help stop leaks during travel, but you really just need to work on keeping them upright. Yes, more cleaning - and thank goodness for microwave sterilizers. I simply handwashed and then boiled for the first child, but love my microwave steamer now. The markings are fading on some of my bottles, but I believe that hand-washing has saved them a little. I compared to Avent (which were only slightly cheaper - but had lots of "transition to sippy cup" type of advantages (or breast pump straight to bottle). I still love my Doc Brown's and the complaints of scratched off markings applied to the other bottles, too. I personally preferred the wide-neck because they seem to fit my baby better, but several friends like the standard. We all agree that the Doc Brown's are lifesavers, though. I give a 3 pk of the 8 oz size at every baby shower
