 I used my BOB Revolution for the first time today and I loved it! Here's what i like about it: -Made of high quality, light materials -Easily maneuverable and very smooth over any surface -Sun canopy blocks out sun from any angle without obstructing the passenger's view -Large viewing window on top of canopy -Storage basket is large and easily accessible -Seat reclines -Straps are easy to adjust -Front wheel is easy to lock and unlock (the pivoting front wheel is a MUST on a jogger) -Easy to fold and transport -Brake is easy to engage and disengage This stroller is worth the money
