 I GOT THIS PUMP AT THE HOSPITAL AND IT WORK GREAT FOR ME. I CAN PUMP MORE MILK WITH THIS ONE THAN WITH MY ELECTRIC PUMP. I USED THIS ONE INSTEAD THAN MY ELECTRIC PUMP WHEN WATCHING TV. IS A MANUAL PUMP SO YOU WILL GET A WORK OUT USING IT. IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE ELECTRIC MEDELA PUMP THATS GREAT, BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PUMP OFTEN THIS WORKS GREAT. IS VERY EASY TO TAKE WITH YOU AND HELP IN TIMES YOU ARE ENGORGE AND THE BABY CAN'T LATCH TO DRINK
