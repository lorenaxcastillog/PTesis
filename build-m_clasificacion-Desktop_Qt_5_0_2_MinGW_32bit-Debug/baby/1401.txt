 I've owned this stroller for more than two years and have used it almost every day, typically strolling two miles per day, often with lots of groceries in the storage basket. My toddler also takes her naps in the Graco (won't nap anywhere else). One little piece just broke and it's not a safety issue but I'm taking the opportunity to shop for a smaller stroller. Reading reviews of other strollers, including pricey ones, made me appreciate the Graco even more. I do wish it was a little more narrow to maneuver through tight store aisles, and to take up less room in my house, but I have no other complaints. Here's a list of pros and cons... Pros: - Rides very, very well. Durable up and down curbs. - Large storage area accommodates up to three bags of groceries. - Toddler is comfortable and naps in stroller. - Reclines easily and folds pretty easily. - Two cup holders in back and one in front tray which clicks off on one side to remove child more easily. - Window in back to view child through shade. - Adjustable handle is good for tall people (I'm 5'10" and push it comfortably). - Works with Graco car seat for newborns Cons: - Quite wide. Sometimes hard to fit through aisles of small neighborhood stores and takes up a lot of space in home and car trunk. - Doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat. - Shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she is quite tall. Until about one year of age, I draped a light blanket over the shade when necessary.
