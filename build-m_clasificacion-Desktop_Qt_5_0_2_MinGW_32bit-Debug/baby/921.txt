 I have a climber! She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months. She was way too young for a bed. We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep. It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe. Life saver
