 I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby. This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006. Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:- 1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding. I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again. So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going. 2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me. The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise. 3) It never breakdown ever! For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day. I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling. It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry. 4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply. 5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319. But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500). Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump. This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops. This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it!
