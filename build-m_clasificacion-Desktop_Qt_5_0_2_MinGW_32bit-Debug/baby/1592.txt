 I've had this pump for about 5 months and I use it before I go to work in the morning, twice at work, and once when I get home. I was a little concerned at first because for such an expensive pump the motor only has a 90 day warranty. I plan to keep my daughter on breastmilk until she's at least one and wanted a pump that would last. I tried one of the Avent manual pumps, but I had to be engorged before I would get a few ounces out of one side (nothing out of the other). The Medela pump is so much easier and does all the work for you. The pump has held up so far and I'm really happy with it. I bought extra shields and bottles to pack with me to take to work, and keep the rest at home. The only downside I saw to these bottles is that they are made to fit only with Medela products. Otherwise, the pump is great and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something durable and easy to use
