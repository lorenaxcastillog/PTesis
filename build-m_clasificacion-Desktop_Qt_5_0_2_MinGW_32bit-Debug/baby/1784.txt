 My son has had the smaller version (11") Fluffles (aka Lambchop) since birth. He is now 9 months old and has to have "Lambchop" go everywhere he goes. Needless to say Lambchop gets very used. The label says surface clean only, but my Mother keeps our son and she decided one day to try to wash Lambchop. He really needed a good washing because our son was going through the heavy drooling stage and Lambchop's fur was getting crunchy. Well, he made it through the gentle cycle and through the dryer (on a rack with the air fluff cycle). He has been washed this way several times. He comes out so nice and fluffy. Of course, wash at your own risk, but it works for us. I am going to purchase our son the larger version (14") Fluffles. This will be so handy in the event we have to retire the original Fluffles (Lambchop), and Fluffles will be able to grow with our son, also. We love this toy
