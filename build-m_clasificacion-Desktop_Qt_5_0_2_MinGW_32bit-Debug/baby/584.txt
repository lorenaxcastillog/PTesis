 I have bought this set for a gift, but also received it as a gift myself (from my registry). Although my daughter is two and a half now, I would recommend the Playtex nursers to everyone! They are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles. I definitely like the Drop-Ins liners better than the traditional ones... from a convenience standpoint, paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system. I'm not planning on any more children, but I don't dare part with these bottles yet. They are stored in my basement for future use, either my myself or family members. They also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze
