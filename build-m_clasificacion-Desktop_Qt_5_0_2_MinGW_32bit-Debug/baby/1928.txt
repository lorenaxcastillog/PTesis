 Zanzibar is a great theme! I have twin boys and the characters seem so much like 3D that they just like to stare at almost everything I have with Zanzibar characters. Including the valance! Also everyone has given me great compliments on the theme. I would also like to add that I think it will go a long way during there toddler years because it works for when they are babies and when they are toddlers. It is a bit of a mature theme. I love it!
