 We bought two of these extensions for the Hands Free Gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old. This gate including extensions are a lifesaver! You can read my review on the gate as well, lol. The extensions are very easy to add and very sturday. Adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do. It is just what it states, an extension. It keeps it just as strong as sturdy! Worth the money
