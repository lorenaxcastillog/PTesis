 This is our first baby monitor, so I can't compare it against others, but we love it. It is very quiet (when the baby is asleep). There is very little static or interference. We haven't ever picked up any other conversation. I haven't been able to figure out what frequency is broadcasts at. The box and the instructions never say. As some others have mentioned, the LED (lights) indicators are nice. If I'm in the shower I can watch the monitor and see if the baby is making noise even if I can't hear it. Also, we have no problem with reception anywhere in the house. Our house is 2500 sq. ft one story just for comparison
