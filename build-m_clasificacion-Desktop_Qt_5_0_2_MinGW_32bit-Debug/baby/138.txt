 This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious. I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back. It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders. Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight. Don't waste the money I would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer. The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci's, keys, money and cell.
