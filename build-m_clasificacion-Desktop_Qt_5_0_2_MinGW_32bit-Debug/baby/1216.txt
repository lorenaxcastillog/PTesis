 I have read the other reviews and find some differing opinions. I loved this pump because it was very effective for my needs. I used it everyday at work for 6 months. It took 20 minutes to express the milk I had and the bags that go with the pump accurately measure the milk. Also, I was able to use one arm and hand to hold the cups in place while I made phone calls with the other. I can't imagine another pump being more effective
