 We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house
