 I bought this potty for my kids over 20 years ago and bought it again for my grandson. I must agree the plastic is not as heavy duty as it was 20 years ago but it works just as great. It is easy for the child to place on the toilet by themselves. Encourages independence. The handles are well placed for them to turn around. The step is adjustable to give your little boy the opportunity to stand and go. I think this product is fantastic
