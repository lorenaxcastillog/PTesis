 My daughter just turned 1 year old. She's on the tiny side so I was concerned as to what type of carseat I was going to purchase. I read many reviews on Britax and it seemed like the company to go with. I loved the print of this and my daughter looks so cute in it. Not to mention that she finds it much easier to fall asleep in this seat than in her infant carrier. My husband said it was fairly easy to install and I know getting her in and out as well as adjusting the straps is a breeze. It was a perfect buy and I would recommendend to anyone
