 We have tried 3-4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children (now 4 yrs and a 10 month old). This is a GREAT option for a gate. Ours is solidly installed, it clicks shut automatically with an audible click (so after my 4 year old goes through, I don't have to worry about him leaving it open - it closes by itself AND I can hear the "click" that tells me it closed), and you don't have to drill holes in your woodwork/staircase to install this. It is much easier to open, just as sturdy as the drill-in gates, and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried. We love it for our house
