 We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much. But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue. However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper. (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!) The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me. We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part. I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed. (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.) The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon. (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!) We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle
