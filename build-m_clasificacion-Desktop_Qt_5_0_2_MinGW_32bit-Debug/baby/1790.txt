 I received this gift after my daughter was born and we used it for the first time today and I LOVE IT! It was so soft and warm that I wish they made them for adults! The colors are beautiful and the entire thing is washable. The only downfall is that there is no way to cover her head without her suffocating. Luckily there is extra fabric on the top piece that I tucked underneath my hand while I was carring the carseat and it did block the horrible Michigan wind. If there were 10 stars then the Urban Bundle Me would receive all 10
