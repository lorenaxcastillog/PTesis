 The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks. This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger. I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm
