 I received the crib in a box that was in shreds. Amazingly, all the pieces were intact because the hardware was in a sealed, smaller box. The delivery people must have stuck some other hardware that was loose in shipping into the box, because I got some that weren't even part of the crib! They must have thought the pieces had fallen out of it because it was in tatters. There were a few marks on the metal crib, but if it had been wood I'm sure it would have been worse. Very disappointed in the shape of the box, but the crib was acceptable
