 One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw: it cant be put back into its carrying form. Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess. It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag. This "floppy" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car. After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution: Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options. (Read my AMApedia article) Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both. Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison. I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag.
