 Although we have yet to use this item (our baby is not due for another 2 months), I can say we are very impressed with it so far. It was in perfect shape when it shipped, the instructions were easy to follow, it was easy to build, and it looks beautiful. It's also very sturdy and seems well constructed. It's a very elegant addition to any nursery, and I love the cherry colour. Much more classy looking than many more expensive products. We also bought the Emily changing table and the Emily 4 drawer dresser, and are very impressed with both of those too.
