 We purchased the new Graco "hands free" diaper pail after our 4th child was born hoping that it would hold in the odor like our Diaper Genie did, unfortunately we wasted $49. We used the Diaper Genie on our first 3 children, after sampling others, and have always come back to the Diaper Genie. It is the best in keeping odors in, just make sure you change it regularly and you'll love it. The Diaper Genie II is better than the "twist away" style too. I would difinitely recommend this product
