 If you are going back to work and pumping full time you will probably want to go electric, but as far as hand pumps go, this one is great. Great suction if you put it together right (there is a little piece that if you put it in upside-down you get frustratingly little suction if any at all.) The cup is comfortable though it does puddle a small amount. I have not noticed any other leaks in this unit. It is small, compact and able to produce 4 ounces in under 15 minutes
