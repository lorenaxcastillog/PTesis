 This is a very good item that every parent should have, an awsome gift to give and receive. I got it from a friend who got it as a gift from another one of our friends and honestly it is one of my favorite gifts ever. I take my baby a bath and then I put an onesie on her and then I put her in this sleep sack and I dont worry about her getting cold during the night because as she moves arround her crib the sack moves with her, now I dont have to check her during the night, and at the same time I am not afraid that she will cover her face with it. You will not regret this purchase
