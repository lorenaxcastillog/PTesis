 This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still "shoot" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the "projection path" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too.
