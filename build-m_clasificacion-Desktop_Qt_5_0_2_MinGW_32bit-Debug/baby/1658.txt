 I received this travel system yesterday and couldnt wait to put it together. The car seat comes fully assembled but the stroller needs to be put together. I didnt find it difficult at all since everything just snaps into place. I gave this 4 stars because I find it a little difficult to attach the carseat to the stroller. I find myself having to try quite a few times before it snaps into place. The other thing is that closing the stroller needs some practice before you can get it right. Other than those two issues, the stroller system is very classy and different from others out there. The material is very soft to the touch and the huge wheels make it a whizz to push around.
