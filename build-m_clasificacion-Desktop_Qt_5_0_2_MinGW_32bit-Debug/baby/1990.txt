 If you have cats or a climber, THIS IS FOR YOU!!! I have both. This is my 3rd tent. I still have 2 and the original on my sons pac n play. It had been on my daughters so it's lasted almost 4 years now and is still in like new (execept for the odd grape juice stain) and I just bought another to have at my sisters. My soon to be 2 year old is a huge climber. He can get out of anything. We have to zip him up to keep him contained. My sisters is NOT kidproof so I got this for our last trip to visit. It worked great. As far as the complaint, NONE FROM ME!!! It is not that hard to get together but I could see how some might have dificulties with it. It is easier to keep up vs taking it down but it's not that hard. If you have cats or a climber get this tent, there is also a crib tent
