 If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.
