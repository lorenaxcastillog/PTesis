 This exersaucer has many great aspects. There are many toys for entertainment and if your child gets bored with the toys that came with the system, switch-a-roo's can be bought to mix things up. Our daughter has had this since she was 3 months old and at 5 months loves it even more. She loves the frog on the string because she can easily "mouth" it. There is learning and music on two of the three electronic toys and volume control on all. We use the arch solely for floor play at home and away from home because they are difficult to reach when attached to the exersaucer at an earlier age. Not sure how the toddler station will entertain yet; but as an infant, this toy is great. The cost can be expensive, but when you add up the variations, it is well worth the cost. The system does collapse but is still bulky and heavy to move around. The system can be a little time consuming to assemble but aren't our little ones worth it?! At the same time we bought a stationary bouncer because our daughter loved to bounce when we held her. However, we found that she stays entertained with this exersaucer for longer and seems to enjoy it better as of now. I highly recommend this product for a child to learn to entertain themselves (which builds imagination and better attention spans... and gives mom/dad a moment to clean a bottle or two) and is a great tool to interact with your child as you sit on the floor (eye contact and communication reinforces learning with the toys)
