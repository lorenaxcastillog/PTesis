 I have a 19 month old daughter and one due in August, so I have been on the look out for a double stroller that I actually liked. When we saw the quattro duo we couldn't wait for it to come out. We waited for it to hit the shelves which did not happen around here yet. So we nervously ordered it online without a test drive. Our nerves were settled when we recieved it the other day. Yes it is heavy, but I manage fine. It is longer than the picture but if it was any shorter you could not fit 2 children in it. This stroller has too many nice features to dwell on the small negatives. The best part besides the easy fold down is that it fits easily with room into my car (I have a Mazda 6). This was a big worry, but not anymore. I love this stroller and and very happy with the purchase
