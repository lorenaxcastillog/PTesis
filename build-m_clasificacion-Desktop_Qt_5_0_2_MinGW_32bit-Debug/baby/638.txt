 This product definitely saves space but I've had a hard time cleaning the tray. Yes, it's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand-washing it. There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I'm always finding places that I misseed washing. Trust me, the baby will manage to get food there too! This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing (I've seen this on some highchair models).
