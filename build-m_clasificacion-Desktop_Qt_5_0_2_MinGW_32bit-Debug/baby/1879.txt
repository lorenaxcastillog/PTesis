 I really liked this dresser (and the matching 5 drawer dresser) but I was hesitant to order it through Babies R Us. I found it online at JC Penny.com, and found a free shipping code online as well (saved lots of $$ with that!). Both pieces arrived in about two weeks, and in perfect condition. My husband and I put the pieces together in about 2-3 hours and are very pleased with the quality considering the price. I would recommend JC Penny if you really like this furniture. I give JC Penny Five stars
