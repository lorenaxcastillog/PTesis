 This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used. It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail. It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it. After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good. Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this. I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail
