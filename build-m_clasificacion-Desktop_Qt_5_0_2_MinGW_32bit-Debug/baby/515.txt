 My son is [...] and aside from getting too big for his crib, my sister is having a baby and needs it. I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his "crib attachment," but this bed made it easy as pie. It's adorable, sturdy and fun. My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we've never had a problem (we've had it for a month). He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying "choo choo." It's just been great....I'm so glad we spent the money
