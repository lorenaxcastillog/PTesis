 I saw this at the store, and I just had to buy it. I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place. The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table. What a marvelous concept! So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it. It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical! When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump. So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead. It was the next best thing and I really did like the device. I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it. So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it. This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed.
