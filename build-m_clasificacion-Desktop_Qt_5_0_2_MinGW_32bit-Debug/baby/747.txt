 We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it. The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly. The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use. Our Graco does that too so I don't know if that is the norm with monitors. The sound is the best when pluged in. The nightlight is great. The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet. It say's it is 19% in every room and I don't know that is correct. The temp works fine. I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works. I like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time. I haven't used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful. Over all - like my choice in the monitor.
