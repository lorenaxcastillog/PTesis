 I usually love The First Years products. I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it. I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one. I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one. Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one. Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair. You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide. At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure. Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray. The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down. You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level. And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model. Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat.
