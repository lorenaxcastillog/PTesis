 This product is really great. The combination of ginger (which helps with nausea) and fennel (which helps settle upset stomach) make it safe for children and they enjoy the taste. My son, who was a year when we started giving this to him, was constantly fussy, whether it was teething or sour tummy, or any number of other things, and ibuprophen and acetominophen weren't helping. Plus, there was a fear of giving him too much of those. This product helped calm him within 15 minutes and usually only gave it to him once a day, if even that. I highly recommend this product and only wish I had known about it when he was a baby, as it's been told to me that it helps with colic as well
