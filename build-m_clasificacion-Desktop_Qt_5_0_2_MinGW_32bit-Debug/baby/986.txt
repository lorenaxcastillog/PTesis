 A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read.
