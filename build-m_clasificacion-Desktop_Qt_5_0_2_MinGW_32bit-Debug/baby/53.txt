 I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!! I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed. It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed. And it would constantly come unlocked. And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty. I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove
