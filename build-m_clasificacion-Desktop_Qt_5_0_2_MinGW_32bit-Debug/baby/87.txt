 I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm. I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice. First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc. I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband. Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results. I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT
