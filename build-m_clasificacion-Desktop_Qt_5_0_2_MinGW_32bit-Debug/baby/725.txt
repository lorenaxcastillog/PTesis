 My son is 5 months old and LOVES this jumper!!! He can keep himself entertained and I am able to do some things with both hands! Plus, it's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down, laughing! I love the tray around it. It's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way. Also, the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out. We are going on vacation in a month and this WILL be making the trip!
