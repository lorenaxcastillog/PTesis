 I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept. The first night we used it, my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports. He was horrified that our son could have suffocated. This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits. I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move at all
