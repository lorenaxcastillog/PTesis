 We don't have our baby yet -but have tried the tub to see if it works. The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it. this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't. The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor. Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money
