 When my son was 5 months old, he was almost too tall for his infant carseat so my husband and I started looking for a seat that would last him until he was old enough to ride without one. Initially, I wanted the Britax, but I didn't know anyone who had one and I was really afraid to spend $300 (including tax) on a seat. So we bought the Eddie Bauer. I didn't hate it, it was ok, but it did NOT fit in our car (Toyota Rav-4). So we gave that seat to my mother so she could use it on occaision when she babysits and we bit the bullet and bought the Britax - OH MY GOSH. We love it! It installed in like 2 minutes, I'm not kidding. I could not BELIEVE how simple it was. My son (who is now 6 months) LOVES it - he is so comfy and he can sleep in it without his head leaning way over like it did in the Eddie Bauer. He never cries when he is in it - it sits up straight enough that he can look around which he also loves. The fabric feels so wonderful and wipes clean pretty easily. I love the one hand strap adjustment and the velcro that holds the straps out of the way for boarding. We're planning a plane trip in May, and I can tell you we'll be taking this seat. And when our next baby arrives, he or she will be riding in a Britax. They ROCK
