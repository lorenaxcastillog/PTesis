 I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers! If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great! The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models. This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense! I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future. Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light. When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones. I am glad to have this "luxury" for my baby. I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM. It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort. I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway? I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions. I just add water whenever I add wipes; it's a no-brainer! If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions. I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth
