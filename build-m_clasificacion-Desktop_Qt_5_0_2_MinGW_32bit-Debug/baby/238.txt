 My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple.
