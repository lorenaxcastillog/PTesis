 I bought this Sleep Sheep for my son who was 20-months at the time. He was transitioning into a big-boy bed. He loved the bed, but wanted me to stay with him until he fell asleep. I bought this sheep in hopes of another source of comfort for him, to replace me! It worked! He loves it. The only downside is there is only 2 sound settings he likes. The heartbeart and whale sounds are a little creepy. I would've liked to have a few more options like birds or a babbling brook. But we do love the rain and the ocean settings that are available. I say "we" because I find it very soothing too
