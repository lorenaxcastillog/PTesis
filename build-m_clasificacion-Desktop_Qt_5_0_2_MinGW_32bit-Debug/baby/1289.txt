 I purchased two of these gates, one for the top of the stairs and another for the bottom of the stairs. It is simple for an adult to use, but tricky enough that a toddler can not open it independently. Unlike other swing gates, this gate does not have any parts that run along the floor. I have heard complaints of adults and children tripping over the "threshold" of some other gates, so I think this is a better design. Another nice feature is that this gate is made out of wood. My favorite feature is the price! I only paid about $35, while many similar gates sell for $100. I cannot give this product 5 stars, because it is a little difficult to install properly. You must be precise or the latch will not line up. Once you have it in place, it is a wonderful gate
