 After going through MANY strollers, this stroller definitely gets my vote. It's lightweight, compact, and has lots of features that a bulky stroller has. The handles are long so I don't have to hunch over anymore as I did with my umbrella stroller. The recline feature is also good. It allows my son to sleep comfortably rather than falling to the front while asleep. The basket is also nice. The only reason I gave it 4 star because sometimes the wheels tend to get twisted around and get stuck while being on rough sidewalks. Other than that, I really like this stroller
