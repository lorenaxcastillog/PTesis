 I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better. I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly. Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item. I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box. Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed. Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future
