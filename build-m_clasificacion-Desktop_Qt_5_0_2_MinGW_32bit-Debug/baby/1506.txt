 Had a few swaddle blankets...my son HATED being swaddled...so this blanket worked out well for us...he would fall asleep at the breast and then I could lay him down ON this blanket and wrap him up in it while he was asleep (no battles) and he was snug in his blanket which helped him sleep longer and better...but the other blankets required wrapping and flipping under him, etc...which woke him or if I swaddled him while awake, he would cry and fuss...so this was my swaddling savior...I have since bought more for my baby due sooN! :)
