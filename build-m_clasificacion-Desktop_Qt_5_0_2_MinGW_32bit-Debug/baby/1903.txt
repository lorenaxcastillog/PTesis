 I used the medela hospital grade electric pump and also the manual and always had a hard time expressing enough milk to relieve my engorgement let alone feed my infant while I was away. Received this pump as a gift and wouldn't use an electric again if givent the chance. I love this pump! I am able to express enough milk for her feeding in about 15-20min. I have no discomfort like I did with the medela. Very easy to assemble once you figure it out the first time, easy to clean (using microwavable steam clean bags are great), very compact. After reading the reviews about the flimsy neck I now tighten the pump to the bottles using the pump base as to avoid breakage. Good luck!!! I very highly recommend this pump
