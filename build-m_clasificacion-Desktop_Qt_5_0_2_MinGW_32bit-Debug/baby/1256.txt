 We use this storage and feeding set every day. We bought other feeding bottles, but having the breastmilk in these bottles for sure creates convenience with great speed. We use these to store the milk in the freezer and/or fridge, and then whenever baby is hungry daddy or/and sitter simply attaches the nipple and cap, places bottle in bottle-warmer and - voila - it's all ready in a matter of a few mins. No fuss transferring milk from freezer bags into bottles. Also, because nipple is on the bottle when bottle placed in the warmer, the nipple gets all warm and supple, which our baby prefers (rather than having a cold/harder nipple)
