 So...I bought this for our 7 month old. What a nightmare. What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE. It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen. And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end. Forget the bar cover. It is just as narrow. This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING. To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support. My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed. The cusion part totally doesn't cover it. Just bad. Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart
