 I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser, but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric. It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad. The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable. I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one, just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose
