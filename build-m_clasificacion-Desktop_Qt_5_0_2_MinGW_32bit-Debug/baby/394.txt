 The suctions are pretty weak, dont stick well to the tray. Also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up. The arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face. When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick, as soon as my son would touch it, it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face. They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time. I took this back the next day. I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead. It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose, even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray.
