 I purchased this item for my 6 month old and I love it. It replaces the need for a jacket and I can unzip the Bundleme when we are out shopping to keep my little one from getting too hot. I still put a hat on him when its very cold out but I do not have a problem with the wind blowing the top flap off (I have seen that complaint in other reviews) as my car seat has a canopy and that has never been an issue. The material is very soft on the inside and my baby is very comfortable in it. I would highly recommend this product
