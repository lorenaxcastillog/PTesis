 I too am very pleased with this gate. Over the past week I installed one each at the top of our two staircases. I strongly recommend following the advice of one of the other reviewers to skip using the template. The lower fixture on the hinge side is lowest to the ground, so I installed that first, then held it in place to mark the spot for the upper hinge. After that was on, I put the gate on the hinges, held it in place and marked the opposite side. Worked great, and it allowed me to work around the mouldings, which would have been difficult with the template. The wood screws held great in the one bannister on one staircase. On the other staircase, I had to put the gates into drywall. There was a beam on one side, so I had to buy much longer screws to ensure a tight grip. The other side was hollow, so I bought some good metal anchors, so the gate is on very tight. All I did was bring the fixtures to the hardware store and found screws and anchors that would fit the holes. Cost me about $10 to get enough anchors and screws for four gates. Most of the poor reviews sound like there are some hardware issues. I take one star away because I think the gate should come with alternate screws, and maybe anchors, because I think it's a bad assumption that most people are installing into wood. I would very much recommend this gate, but advise paying close attention to what you're installing into first and make sure you've got the right hardware
