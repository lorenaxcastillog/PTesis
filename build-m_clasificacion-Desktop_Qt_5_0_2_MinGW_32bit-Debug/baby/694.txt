 This chair is larger than some of the seats out there, and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well. Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use, as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats! The seat is shaped just right for splashes, and it seems comfortable. Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day, we'd be in business! I love the simple design, my son loves the color (he picked it out himself), and it's so simple to clean. It also has grips on the bottom so that it won't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must
