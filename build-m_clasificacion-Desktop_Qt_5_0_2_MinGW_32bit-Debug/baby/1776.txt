 I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces. The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums. I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet
