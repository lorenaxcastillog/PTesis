 Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product. From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby. She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open. Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds. Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch. She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little "lay lay lay" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's. Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst. Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation! At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals. She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition. Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, "if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it". We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours. We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.
