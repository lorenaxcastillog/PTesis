 I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet. She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though. The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were. She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her. It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads. I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges". I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.
