 this stroller is the BEST 250.00 that i have spent in a long time!! we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters (aged 16 mo's and 3) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood. depending on weather and moods sometimes we'd do 3 laps. it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills. plus, i can actually JOG or even RUN!!! i can't tell who loves it more, me, the dog, or my girls. it's light, easy to steer, worth EVERY penny. plus, i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls. oh, and it was incredibly easy to put together
