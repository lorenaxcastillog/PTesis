 I was six months pregnant with twins, had a broken leg and a not-quite three year old who figured out pretty quickly that he could outrun Mama. When he nearly ran into a parking lot, I bought this item because his safety is my number one concern. When my son started getting rowdy in a crowded public location, I was able to slip this harness on him very quickly and easily because of the strategically placed velcro. I anticipated some snide comments from passerbys, but did NOT expect my son to give me a baleful look and announce (loudly): "I NOT a puppy, Mama!" Needless to say, my son did not like it one bit but it was comfortable and doesn't restrict the arms. It's a very good product, but it requires practicing with your child before it will be effective because the velcro WILL give if you and your child try to go in opposite directions
