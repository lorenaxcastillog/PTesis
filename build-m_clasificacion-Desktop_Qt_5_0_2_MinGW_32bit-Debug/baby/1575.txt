 after debating about spending the $$ on this seat, i purchased this and 2 others to try in our small SUV. (we have a land rover freelander.) the others were bulky and harder to install. this was by far the best of the 3 i bought. (i returned the other 2!) not only is it comfortable for my baby, who has so far used it from 3 months to 9 months old and it still looks brand new... but it also is easy for me to put her in. the straps don't twist and i love the velcro that holds the straps to the side as i put in/take her out. this model also rated the highest in consumer reports crash tests!! my daughter will use this one til we have another baby that needs it, then i will buy a big girl Britax seat for her
