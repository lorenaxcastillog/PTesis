 My daughter loved this chair once we opened the box. The seat's back has a nice and soft fur like material. The seat is about 15 inches wide so it will fit her til she gets married unless she is overweight! The only down side is the stability. It seems like the chair can fall back if it rocks a little harder. It's good that the rocking part is screw on so I may consider taking them out. Other than that, the seat serves it's purpose.
