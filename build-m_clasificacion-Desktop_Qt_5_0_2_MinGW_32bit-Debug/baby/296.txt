 I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!! Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up.
