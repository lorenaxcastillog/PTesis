 I have been searching for a light weight stroller for about a month now and after looking everywhere I found the Zooper Twist online. I was a little hesitant because there was only 1 review on it and I could not locate it in a store to see for myself. I am so happy that I went with my instincts and purchased it. I love it!! The features on it are great and it's so light!! It is so easy to carry and it comes with a handle that's attached to the side. It is also very easy to open & close. It even came with a rain cover and a boot.I wanted something with good quality without spending a fortune. I couldn't believe the price on Amazon and for free shipping you couldn't beat it. The only thing that some people may not like is the basket being so small but if you can get past that I think it's a great stroller. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
