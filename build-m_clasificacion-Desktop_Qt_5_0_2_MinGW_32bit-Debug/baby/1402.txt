 I was actually pretty impressed by this potty, and just happened across Amazon to see what the price was here (I had to buy it at a B&M, and wanted to double check to see if I overpaid). This was for Child #2. Child #1 had a potty, but was potty trained in the span of a week and never even sat on it (she used training seats instead). Child #2, well, not so good. After a few weeks of unsuccessful attempts at the training seat, I decided to get him a potty. Had I read the reviews here first, I never would have bought this one. Luckily, the B&M was my first stop and I ended up with two of these potties (one for home, one for grandma). Pros: Works as advertised Easy assembly and cleanup Decent battery life Inexpensive Cons: The musical fanfare that follows a successful 'drop' isn't foolproof, and will sometimes fail to activate. Deflection cup in the front is a little awkwardly placed, causing some collision (do I have to elaborate on that one? :) Summary: It's under twenty bucks, assembles in minutes, and doesn't eat batteries. OK, sometimes the music won't work - it's not exactly a high precision laser sensing toilet (if such an animal exists). It'll still work 90% of the time. I had bought the expensive potty for Child #1, and trust me - although it cost more than double the price of this unit, there were no appreciable differences between the two. It's easy to clean, inexpensive, and works as advertised. I wish more kids items managed to meet these simple requirements
