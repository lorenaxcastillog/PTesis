 When you need to babyproof your house--especially for those of us who have stairs--don't look any further--this is the gate to use. We had this installed in our former house at the top and bottom of the stairs. Very safe and secure. Our sons tried to climb on it, but couldn't--yanked on it and it wouldn't budge. In our new house, we have a different type of stairs and no gate would work, so we installed these same gates leading to the stairs. Our hallway is wider so we just had to purchase the extensions. Perfect. It prevented our boys from getting up the stairs unsupervised. We just had our third baby (girl), so my husband will be installing these same gates again soon.
