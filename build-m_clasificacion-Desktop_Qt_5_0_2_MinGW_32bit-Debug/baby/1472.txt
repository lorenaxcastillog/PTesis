 I seriously love this bowl and spoon. The bowl fits nicely in your hand so it's easy to feed a squirming baby. The spoon has a very soft tip so you don't have to worry about hurting their gums. My daughter is a year old and mostly feeds herself, but we are still using the bowl for snacks or I'll put yogurt in one side and fruit in the other. The lid always stays on and the bowl still looks new even though we've used them a lot. I would highly recommend this product
