 Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old. I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow. My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product. At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing. I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago. But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now! I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be. I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony. Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it. Aside from that it's great. The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son. It isn't very loud to me. But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night. I would say my money is well spent
