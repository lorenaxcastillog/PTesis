 After throwing my First Years crib CD player literally in the trash can (don't get me started on what a complete hunk of junk that thing was), I was on a search to replace it. That is when I came across the iCrib. You really can't beat the price - I'm guessing it is reasonable since most of the controlling is done from the iPod itself. Granted I have only had it a few days, I cannot rave enough about it! It mounted perfectly on the crib and I think the sound is fantastic (I have only tried classical and not music with lyrics so I cannot comment on that sound quality). I inherited my husband's older iPod Shuffle after I gave him a Nano for X-mas. I searched and searched online but could not figure out whether the iPod Shuffle would work with it. Muchkin's customer service verified that it would because it came with a few adapters to accomodate different MP3 players. Now, I don't really think they made one to specifically fit the Shuffle, but it did fit well enough in the "small" adapter they included so I was happy (see the picture I posted of the Shuffle in the iCrib). The iCrib itself has 3 modes - light only (iPod is off), light and iPod, or just iPod. You can also have it play for 15, 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off. The light is actually what I would consider a "light show" with the light slowly changing colors which I think is rather calming as does my baby (or at least it seems). The only things I would change about the iCrib is that I would really like it to have the option of playing longer than 60 min. I would also be happier if it had the option of providing a steady, soft light to serve as a constant night light (no "light show") to guide me during the middle of the night feedings. Otherwise, I am thrilled with the iCrib
