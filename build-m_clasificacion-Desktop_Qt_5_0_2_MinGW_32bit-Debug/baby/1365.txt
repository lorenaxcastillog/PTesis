 The model Amazon sells is J5933, but there is a new 2007 model, L1907. Amazon doesn't sell the new model apparently and I don't know what the differences between them are. I checked the Fisher-Price website and it doesn't say, but they list both models. I ordered mine from Amazon on March 9, 2007. The chair was exactly what we were looking for. Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space. The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps. It also has non-skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners. The 3-point to 5-point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place. We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7-month old kept slouching underneath the tray. The countoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that. The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use. I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat, but I guess it's a nice option to have. The chair reminds me of a car seat, and as such, keeps our baby in place while feeding. The one-handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options. I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair. Perhaps a built-in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something. Just kidding :
