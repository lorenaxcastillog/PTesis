 I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest. These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do. These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work). Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them. They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own. Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease. I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me. Simple, clean and easy.
