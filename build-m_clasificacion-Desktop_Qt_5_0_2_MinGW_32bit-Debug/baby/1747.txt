 I bought this video monitor system right after we moved into a new house when my son (with autism) was 4. Because his bedroom was on a different floor, I was repeatedly going to check on him at night to make sure he was okay and still in his room! I mounted the camera for the widest possible angle -- near the ceiling in a corner of his room -- and now I can check on him all night long. (I leave the volume on very low, so I can hear if he yells, but he doesn't wake me up if he's just playing or drawing.) As parents of autistic kids know, our little ones are often very clever escape artists, so having the reassurance this monitor offers is fabulous.
