 I originally purchased this as a way to keep an eye on my daughter, since she was in the back seat of our van. It turned out to be a sanity saving device . We live by train tracks, and the music and lights help to distract her while we wait. I will say, though, that the cold weather zapped the batteries, so maybe re-chargeables are in order for this toy. My toddler also loves it. He uses the remote to turn it on and off, which in itself entertains his sister
