 I have researched plastic bottles extensively. They are known to leak a little cancer causing chemical into the baby's milk when they are heated. I am not some wacky nut job who thinks everything gives you cancer, but when it comes to our children's health why take a chance. I use these glass bottles at home with my daughter and strongly recommend them to my friends. I know we can't protect are kids from everything, but I am going to do as much as I can for my children.
