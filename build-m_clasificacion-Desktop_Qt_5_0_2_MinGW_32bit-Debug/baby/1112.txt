 I bought the Handy's Plus Pad because, while our son has been potty trained for nearly a year, he sleeps so soundly that he doesn't wake up all the time to go pee at night, and I've had it with changing the bed sheets everyother night! This pad is a great item, it's soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it's plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it's never leaked through. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it's tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I'm not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I'd gotten 2!
