 I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe. Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever. The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward. He never looked comfortable. The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable. These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky. This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it. The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it. The canopy is also terrible because it barely works. It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky. I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face. (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down) I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake. I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric). We are both soooo much happier. He looks comfortable and a little more reclined. The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else. I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did). But in actuality it just sucks. I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional.
