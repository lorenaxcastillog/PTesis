 This is a great item, but, it does have some flaws. I got this for my 2 month old, and he loved it! Now he's 6 months and loves it just as much. The thing is, you need to manually push the button, and then you can use the remote. After it plays all the music, and it shuts off, the only way to turn it back on, is to press the button yourself. Not great when you're flying on the freeway! But, it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on
