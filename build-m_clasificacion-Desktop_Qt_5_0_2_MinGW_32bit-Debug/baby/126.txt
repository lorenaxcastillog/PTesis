 At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them
