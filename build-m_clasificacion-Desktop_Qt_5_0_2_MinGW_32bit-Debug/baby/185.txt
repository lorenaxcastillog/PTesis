 I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck. I HATE IT!! My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there. Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym. Why buy extra toys?? I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys. I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange. What a waste of money for me. I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too. My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym. Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys.
