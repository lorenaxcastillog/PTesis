 This bedding is so cute. My son is 10 months old and he loves to rub on the animals while he is in his crib. Each animal is a different texture and color. We use the comforter as a floor mat and he will play on that and pet the animals. The only thing I did not like was the sheet that came with the set was really lose. So I dont use it. But other than that it is a fun bedding set for him and he has not gotten bored with it yet. We just love it.
