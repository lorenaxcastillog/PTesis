 I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies. I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different. My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal. I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great! Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair.
