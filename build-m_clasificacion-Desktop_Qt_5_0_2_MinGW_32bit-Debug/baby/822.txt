 It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat. I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle. I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out. We just put on her hat and go. The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort. It helps too that it is rain resistant. I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out
