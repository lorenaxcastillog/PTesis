 I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long
