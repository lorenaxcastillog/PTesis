 I'm not a big fan of giving pharmeceuticals to infants, but this line is somewhat 'natural' or as homeopathic as you can get in commercial stores. I used the gas drops religously for both my kids and it really helped with what I call 'colic'. I also use the nose suction and the fingernail clippers--theirs is the best from what I could find. I will give this warning: If you are buying for another person, make sure you check the expiration date. If their baby is not due for a while, you better get one with a later expiration date. This happened to me, BRU had one with an expiration date of two months ahead, so there was no way the person I bought if for could keep it. I felt bad b/c I didn't notice it while I was in the store, and being a new parent, I'm sure it was a challenge for them to return it before they needed to use it. Just a warning
