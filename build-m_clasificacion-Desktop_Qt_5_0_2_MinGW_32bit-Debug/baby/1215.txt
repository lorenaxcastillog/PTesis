 This pump works great for me as a working Mom. It looks professional and I can even fit my lunch in the top. I also love how quickly I can set it up in my office to pump. It is a bit loud so don't try to use it on conference calls unless you hide it under you desk and close the flap. And even then you'll want to check it with a friend listening on the phone for it first. Our battery pack didn't work at first and we didn't check it until we were on the road, so check yours. The white membranes also must be kept very clean and the yellow tips they go in. Even a little bit of old milk will completely kill the suction. But it is worth it even with this issue. Buy it from your lactation nurse at the hospital and then you have someone to give you guidance on how to use it and deal with any issues you have with parts. Although you shouldn't have many.
