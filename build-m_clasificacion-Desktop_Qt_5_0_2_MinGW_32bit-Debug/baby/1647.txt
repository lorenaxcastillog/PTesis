 Bella, my seven month old daughter, was recently given the opportunity to try her very own sound system. She was enchanted by the nightlight display and soothed by the music. Bella is easy to please, Mama is a harder nut to crack, a product has to meet several criteria to be deemed developmentally appropriate, or at the very least not harmful to her children or those of her readers. Cost is important, with all the available products on the market for babies and children you want to get the most for your dollar.[...] Quality and safety are essential, not only do you get a system with superb sound; Munchkin has added a volume control device to the unit to protect baby's delicate hearing from undue noise levels. I love this feature, because many baby products and toys have been found to be so loud they reach levels high enough to cause permanent hearing damage. Bravo to Munchkin for the added protective feature. Extras are always nice when spending your hard earned dollar, this unit offers a nightlight feature, a delicate display of changing hues bright enough that mom or dad can check baby in the crib, soft enough to encourage sleep. The iCrib can be used with or without the nightlight. The iCrib also has an auto shut off allowing for 15, 30 and 60 minutes of play. Ease of use is important when you are running a busy household. Set up and installation is simple, and if it easy for me, anyone can do it. You pop your MP3 player into the back of the iCrib, then hang it on the crib railing with the adjustable Velcro straps found on the back of the sound system. The unit can also be used for travel or enjoying in another room as it has the ability to stand on its own. Munchkin's iCrib was found by Bella and me to be an excellent product. It exceeds our expectations for cost effectiveness, quality, features, and ease of use. The recommended age for the iCrib is 0 and up, making it a wonderful gift either for the holidays or a baby shower.
