 I love this toilet training seat! I like that it's a hard, molded plastic, and not a soft seat. It looks so much nicer in the bathroom and cleans better too. My 3 year old daughter finds it comfortable to sit on. The adjustment knob helps keep the seat in place. I also like the high splash guard in front...girls can have little fountains too, and this is the only seat we've used that keeps everything contained in the toilet. It was well worth the extra money
