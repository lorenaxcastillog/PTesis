 I received this pump as a gift & I'm was very pleased with the outcome. I considered a couple of others, but this one impressed me & for a first time mom I couldn't have choose another. Breastfeeding was new for me and I knew I wanted something that was comfortable & efficient as well. I started out with the Medela while in the hosptial and it was horrible. It pulled my nipples and made them very sore and that was on the lowest suction. I'm glad I received this one as a gift and after 4 months of use it's still going strong. I'm able to use it at work and that's a plus because everything is so handy. Hope you consider this one because you won't be disappointed.
