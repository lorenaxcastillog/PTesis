 First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on? Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick. I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick. Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things? They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid. Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long. Give me the regular bottles any day. PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield! I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there
