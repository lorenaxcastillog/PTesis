 This item is excellent for homes with limited space. There's no worries about where to keep a big, bulky high chair. I also like the fact that it's portable. Just toss it in the trunk and off to grandma's. It also grants you more options on where you feed the baby. You're not restricted to wherever the high chair will fit. I'm also a big fan of being able to get my money's worth out of an item. This chair really does grow with the baby and when he/she is too big to have the tray attached, just push it up the table and you have an instant booster seat. The quality of the chair is good and if used properly should give no trouble. The only problem I initally had with the chair was with the reclining feature. It was a bit stiff and difficult to move but after the first few times it no longer is an issue
