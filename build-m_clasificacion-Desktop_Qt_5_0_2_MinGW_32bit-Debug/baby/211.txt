 Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use. Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously). When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance. PROS for the stroller: very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles. There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position. CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it. The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over). My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat. And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy. Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name "Jeep" it would be built better. We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke. My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built? I would love this stroller if it were just built better
