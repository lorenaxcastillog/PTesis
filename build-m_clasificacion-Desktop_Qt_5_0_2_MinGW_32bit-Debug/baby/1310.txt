 Good shade for the little angels. Would recommend this for every mother that wants to sheild her babies and toddlers from the harsh sun rays. The shade is big, flexible and easy to attach to any stroller. I use a macalaren. The coverage is wonderful!!! You fix it the way you want...all the way to cover up to the babies feet or half way . The sides are well protected too!! May not be so good on real windy days but still does the job when not fighting with the winds
