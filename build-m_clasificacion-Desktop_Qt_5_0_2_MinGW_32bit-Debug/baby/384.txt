 I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers. Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind. But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings. Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM! My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months. All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without.
