 I highly recommend this item. As soon as your little one can sit up on his own, this is a MUST HAVE for all moms. It fits all shopping carts (except COSTCO, but including TARGET) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants. It keeps baby (and Mommy's hands) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart. A MUST HAVE! This is the gift I give at baby showers. I've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach. Still looks good
