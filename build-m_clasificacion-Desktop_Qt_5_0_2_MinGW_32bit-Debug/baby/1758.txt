 I went back and forth before I finally decided to add this to my baby registry. I received it as a gift and I'm so glad that I registered for it. True, the velcro isn't too strong, which makes it slip if alot of heavy items are placed on it. However, I used the strategy that another reviewer used and tied it to the crib with some pretty ribbon and it works wonderfully. I have powder, lotion, baby oil, vaseline, some shoes, as well as a package of diapers and a few more items stored in it and it is holding up fine. I think this organizer can be a very useful and convenient way to keep the much needed items close at hand, especially if you are lacking storage space. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone and I'm so glad that I did finally register for it. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have to make an adjustment, being using the ribbons instead of the velcro that it came with. Otherwise, I have no other complaints
