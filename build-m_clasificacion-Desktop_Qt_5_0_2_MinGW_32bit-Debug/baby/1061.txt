 I bought this for my car shortly after my son was born so I could keep an eye on him. I love this mirror, it keeps my son very happy when he is tired and often puts him to sleep which is great. The music isn't to annoying and the lights are slow enough that they don't bother me while I drive. It's also a great price! My son is 5 months old now and we still use it all the time. I would highly recommend this mirror! It has several different ways to attach to the car as well, so it works in almost every car
