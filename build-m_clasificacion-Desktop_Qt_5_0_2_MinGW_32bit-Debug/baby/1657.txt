 I received the Combi Ex Travel System for my baby shower. It looked like the perfect size/ weight for city living. Unfortunately it did not work out that way. The stroller began squeaking and falling apart from all of the bumping around on brick and cobblestone through the city. The basket is also very very tiny and is inhibited by a large bar through the middle. I would reccommend this stroller for use on smooth surfaces. The carseat is great and easy to use, but the stroller was not what I expected. One tip for the urban parent-- sink your $$ into a good stroller with shocks. It's worth it
