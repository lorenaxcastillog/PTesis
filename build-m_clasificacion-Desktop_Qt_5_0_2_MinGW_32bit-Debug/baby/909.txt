 My son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby. We have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle. Lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet! I will now be putting the bottles away for good this time! I will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand. They are pricey, but if I wouldn't have bought all the other cups, I'd have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place!
