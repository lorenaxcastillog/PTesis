 My daughter is about to turn two and LOVES to pretend to cook and feed her dolls. I chose to order this item for her birthday during a free shipping promotion after seeing the poor choices of play food offered in my local toy stores. It's disappointing that most play food available is fast-food branded (i.e. McDonalds)! Even the "knock-off" tubs of play food are primarily junk food - hot dogs, donuts, cupcakes, ice cream cones, etc. I chose this set because it consists of the foods my daughter primarily eats - fruits and vegetables, eggs, cheese, bread, etc. Some of the pieces are solid plasic, and some are hollow, which leaves a greater question of durability. But even the hollow pieces are made of a very thick, rather ridged plastic which I think will stand up OK over time. I am not even able to squeeze them myself. I also like that the foods are on the small side and actually fit in the small pots and pans sets available right now (although we set aside a few questionably small things, like the carrots and mushrooms, until she is older). Definitely worth the price, I think, when free shipping is available.
