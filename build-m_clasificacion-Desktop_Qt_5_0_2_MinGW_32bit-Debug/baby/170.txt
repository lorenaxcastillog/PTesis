 I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.
