 I only have the turtle and the fishing net. Turtle: The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it. I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months. I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water. There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle. I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings. I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem. Fish net: The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use. The fish themselves are fine.
