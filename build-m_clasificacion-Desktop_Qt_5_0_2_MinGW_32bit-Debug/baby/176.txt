 Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends. The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable. But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore.
