 Since our bedrooms are upstairs it is really convenient to have this product right in the same room. There's no need to go downstairs and leave the baby crying until you get her bottle ready. It takes some time using it to get used to the right temperature since the amount of water it states to use in order to heat up the bottle sometimes does not warm the bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much. I don't go by the amount of water stated to use for each bottle size. Regardless of the size of the bottle or the amount of milk in it past 4 ozs, I fill the vial with water up to 9-10 and push the button. From time to time I take the bottle out and check the temp. Once it is the way I want it to be, I just take it out, shake it, and feed the baby, letting the rest of the water evaporate on its own. This way I know I will always have a warm bottle since once it is turned on and shuts off, you have to wait 10 minutes to warm it up again. Who has the time and patience with a crying baby to tend to? Overall, it is a great idea and has saved me many trips to the kitchen
