 We received one of these as a gift when our first child was born. We then bought a second (one to wash and one to use, as someone else said), and when our second child was born one year after the first, we got a third pad. We also used them under the sheets of the full-size bed when the kids graduated to that (though they tend to shift, and you have to position them in the key area, but it protected the mattress and was more comfortable than the full-size waterproof mattress pads). This is now the very practical gift that I give to any new parents or parents-to-be. It saved me tons of time and effort, and I just like to pass on the favor to others. Very practical, not very cutsie, but extremely useful and generally well-appreciated by anyone who uses it
