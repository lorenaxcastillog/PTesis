 Parents, if you are going to purchase this item you will love to know that the Nuby sippy cups (w/the soft silicone sippy) are compatible with the avent nipples and nipple holder. I wish I would of known this sooner! I would of bought the nuby sippy cups sooner and not spend so much money on the bottles. I give the bottles 4 stars b/c they are durable but they are bulky. The nuby sippy cups are slimmer and hold 8 oz. My baby can't tell the difference! It's the Avent nipple on a slimmer, less expensive, bottle-cup!
