 We have a very large opening between our kitchen and living room, and this was the only barricade with a gate that we could find. We went ahead and bought it, and it was fairly easy to install. Pros: 1) You can angle it so that it custom fits your space. You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions. 2) It has a gate, so you don't have to continuously step over it or take it down. 3) Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one. 4) The gate slowly closes after you walk through it (but it doesn't latch shut, FYI). Cons: 1) Although the gate can be opened with one hand, it's not the easiest (you have to move a button and then lift up, not a huge deal, though). 2) Its also not the easiest to close (have to lift up and then push down). 3) It's wall mounted (not pressure mounted), so it leaves holes in the wall. Overall, I would recommend it
