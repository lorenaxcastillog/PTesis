 For my first breastfed baby these were my salvation. It helped relieve soreness while breast is in bra. It keeps the sore nipple suspended in midair and off of rubbing on your bra. It also helps the nipple stick out a little, which I found made attachment (of baby's mouth to nipple)easier as a first time breast-feeder. You do need to check the shield now and then to dump out any milk (or some may save it). The only way I see a product could improve in that area, would be to have a bottle size attachment to your boob and whom of us would really want to walk around with that? There are holes in the top of the shield to allow air circulation. For me esp. at night I would put a nursing pad over the holes so that it would help soak up any leakage. But by FAR this product is worth it. I'm due soon with baby #2 and am back to buy more. I gave mine to a mom friend who was ready to give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all the time and her breasts were unbearably sore. She swears these shields are the reason she didn't have to give up and is extremely grateful. Definitely worth the try
