 Like most reviewers, I too like this bather. It is much softer than the plastic tubs and folds for fairly easy storage (at least it is smaller to store than the plastic ones.) However, my son's little jaw chatters because he gets chilly because he is so far out of the water. I DO fill my tub up high with water, but the angle of the chair doesn't allow for him to have enough of his body safely submerged. I think it would be great for warmer weather, but January and February in the Midwest are cold. I also wish that the manufacturer would make the washer and bold on the underside a plastic piece. It has rusted on my model too
