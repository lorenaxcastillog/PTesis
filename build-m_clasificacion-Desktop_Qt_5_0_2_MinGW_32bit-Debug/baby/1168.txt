 Well, everything I said below is true but now 10 months later the tub has developed it's 3rd leak so we have to inflate it every night with a foot pump. I'm giving up and ordering another one. Not bad for every day use for 10 months though. My original review: When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using. We couldn't find the snug tub in any of the stores (Babies R Us carries their own brand, Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small). With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm. She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible. Well this tub is the answer. It is everything the reviewers have said - convenient (blow up once and store with suction hook), big (lots of room for toys and splashing), secure (fits very snugly, thus the name) and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it. And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys. Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish. So bath with peace of mind and have fun with the little one
