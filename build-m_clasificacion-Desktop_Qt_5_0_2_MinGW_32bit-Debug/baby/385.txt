 I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles. After a few weeks, she began crying alot. You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain. She would also pass gas constantly. It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards. I tried switching formulas - didn't work. Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked. The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it. Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.) Instantly we noticed a difference! She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry! She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air! Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air. I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate. With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles. She is a completely different baby now. She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying. So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE. If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately! Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown." Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!
