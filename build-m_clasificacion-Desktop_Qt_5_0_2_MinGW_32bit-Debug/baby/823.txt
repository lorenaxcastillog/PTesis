 Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent. I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute. After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was. Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm. No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps! also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great! This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion. My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring. Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it. Love it Love it
