 both my 4 year old and my little daughter 5 month old hate having their noses suctioned! My little girl has reflux and spits up a lot, due to that she always has quite some Milkbuggers up her nose and to add to that, she's teething like a Mammoth right now which makes her congested as well. First she wanted to sqirm away, but the hummingsound that comes from it and the nice Tune it plays destracted her! Since it vibrates quite a bit I first touch her cheek with it so she knows what to expect and she immidetly calmes down and today started even to giggle because it tickled her nose! The long and short tip are both very soft and have no sharp edges and the suction is very gentle. Yes, I do agree that it won't suck crusties out of the nose but even with a bulb, hard stuff should be soaked for a couple of seconds with a squirt of saline up the nose to soften it. Once you do that the bigger buggers will come out with the big tip! I personally find the Bulbs to invasive and the aspirators in Hospital pretty strong, so strong that not even the stuff will use them unless the Babys oxygen drops due to stuffiness in the nose! I KNOW I just spent 1 week in the hospital in February with my duaghter due to RSV, and yes those aspirators there shouldn't be used unless there is no other way (but even there they use always saline first to soften the stuff and then use the suction) Oh, by the way, the Aspirator comes with a handy little sack to store the tips and the easy to take apart and clean Aspirator! sure, the Suction is not as strong as the Hospital one but the Hospital cannot be used as often as you want to, this one is gentle enough and even fun for the little ones while giving them relieve and can be used as needed it is that gentle! That's why it gets 5 stars from me
