 I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth
