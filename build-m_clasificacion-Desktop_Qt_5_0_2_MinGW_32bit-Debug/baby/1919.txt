 My 4.5 month old son LOVES his Jump & Go. It was a Christmas present from Santa, and my husband and I are happy with it as well. I've seen some of the reviews calling it "dangerous" but I think the only danger comes when parents aren't watching their children. We NEVER leave him unattended in his jumper and we've had no problems. For the first week or so he just kind of hung around in it, moving around in circles. He's finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he's the one controlling all of the sounds. The only drawbacks I see with it, and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars, is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud. I wish there was one more quieter setting. Also, as with any doorway jumper, there IS a bit more potential for injury than with stationary jumpers. But as I said before, if you monitor your child, said child should be fine. I highly recommend this product
