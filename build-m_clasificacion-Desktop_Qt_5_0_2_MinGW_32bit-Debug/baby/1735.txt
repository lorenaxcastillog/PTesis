 We have a nine foot opening into the kitchen, which is entirely off limits from my daughter. We have a large amount of small items in there that could easily be choked on, besides the inherent danger of a kitchen. So my daughter has to be kept out! This gate was one of two that would span the distance and this was the more affordable. My husband installed it quickly (within about ten minutes of getting home), adjusted it to the size we needed, and voila! My daughter is turning one this month and the gate looks like it did when we bought it months ago. Even when she puts her full body weight against the mesh, trying to "push" her way through, it doesn't give--not the mesh, the seams, the hardware, anything. I was worried about the bar below the gate being annoying or tripped over but it is so low to the ground that it has never been an issue. The latch on the gate takes a bit to get used to, but the gate stays in place even if the latch is dropped in the cradle and not snapped in. Love it
