 I love how wide they are. This makes them much easier to clean and to handle. Since they are shorter I can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when I use the stopper caps on them. I can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short. My baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles. Her arms don't have to stretch as far. I haven't had any real problems with these bottles. I was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem. I went ahead with them because my sisters said they didn't have any problems with them. They have leaked twice but only because I didn't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet. Any bottle will leak if you don't screw the lid on sufficiently. I have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when I watched my twin cousins. We tried three different brands and weren't ever really happy with any of them
