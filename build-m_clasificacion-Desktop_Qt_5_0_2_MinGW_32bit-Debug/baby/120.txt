 I loved the gate. So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate, I needed the extension. It was well worth it. My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it, and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway. I am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall. This gate was a great purchase
