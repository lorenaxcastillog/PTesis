 I have taken and posted a picture to show what Luke and I carry in this bag. We luckily have not had any ripping or stitching problems. We have a recieving blanket, cell phone, first aid kit (in the ziplock at top of pic) burts bees baby lotion, oil and diaper rash ointment, 3 diapers, bag of wipes, bib, onsie, sleeper, burp cloth, 2 toys, hat, and 3 empty ziplocks to hold dirty diapers, clothes that have ahd to be changed or trash. What is not in the picture is the camera that goes in the middle compartment because that took the picture. My cannon S2 powershot goes in the middle compartment! We don't have anything in the bottle container, but that is where we stuff dirty diaper and clothes ziplocks and there is nothing in the larger front pocket, so we have room to spare. Excellent design and as other reviewrs have noted the colors are great in person. This is a great bag for day hikes and outings with dad. And it has held up great for us so far
