 I really like this mobile. It keeps my 13 week old infant entertained and she also falls asleep to it from time to time. She gets so mesmorized by it that she will fall asleep. My only problem with it was the first one they sent me did not work but Amazon does such a great job with returning it that all I had to do was email them that it do not work and they sent me one right away to replace it and all I had to do was print the label out and postage and everything was taken care of, just had to drop it off at the post office. I actually got the replacement within 4 days so that is pretty good. They are on top of things.
