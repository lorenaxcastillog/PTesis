 I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles. Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!! The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them. She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot. Don't waste time or money with Avent!
