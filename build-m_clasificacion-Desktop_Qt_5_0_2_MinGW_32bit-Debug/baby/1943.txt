 This works well, but if your door handles are thin, you may need to add some additional padding to make sure this springs back to the locked position. I taped some cardboard around some of our very thin "elegant" door handles to make this fit better. Note that some reviews elsewhere state that installing this on one side of your door could lock you out from the other side. That is flat out wrong, regardless of what type of handle or button is on the other side of the door. I used screws -- I wouldn't count on double-sided tape to protect my child. If you had to use tape, then I would try the kind that comes with the 3M removable hangars. It is very strong and removes without damaging surfaces
