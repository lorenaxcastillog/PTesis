 Used for 2 kids so far... The Good: * It protects his feet/arms from getting stuck in the slats. * When they pull up, they can chew on the material instead of the wood. * Easy to remove to wash. The Bad: * The velcro straps at the bottom aren't long enough so they don't stay done. * The head and foot pieces slide down when pulled on. * First son pulled one of those pieces down and climbed up on it. If this is all you can get, I'd get it, but it does need some improvements.
