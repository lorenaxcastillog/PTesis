 I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray! But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable! I don't understand why it got such high marks... The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place. We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough. In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings. Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list... I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing... The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors. ;
