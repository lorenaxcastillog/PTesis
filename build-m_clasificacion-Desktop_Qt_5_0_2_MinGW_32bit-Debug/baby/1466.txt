 My son was one of those climbers so i had to buy this when he was 18 months. He was able to climb out but had a couple falls that made me nervous. We have had it for awhile now and i absolutely love it. I am also happy to have it for the next child so that i don't have to worry about my son throwing things into the crib. I recommend it to all parents. It is easy to assemble. I have one at my mom's house and home. At first my son was a little uneasy about it but i zipped it up while he was sleeping each night until he just got used to it. Now he asks me to do it.
