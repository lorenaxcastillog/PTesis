 We bought this chair for my 3 year old son when he was born and we are still using it! So when my daughter was born 8 months ago we kept thinking that our son would be ready for a "big" chair. Well, he informed us that he was not giving up his chair so we had to buy another one for our daughter. I love how easy it is to clean, that it reclines, and that the tray is so easy to get on and off. Also, we don't have a lot of room in our house, so this just sits in one of our chairs and if we need to take it somewhere, we can do that too
