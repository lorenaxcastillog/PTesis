 I put this stroller system on my registry and we've been using it since my son was born last year. He is now 11 months and still fits in the infant carrier. We like that the carrier can be used in multiple cars so we bought an extra base. The stroller height seems great for my husband (6'2") and for me (5'8"). We don't feel like we are hunched over when pushing it. The stroller seems like it folds very compactly, but it still doesn't fit into my VW Cabrio trunk (the trunk opening is just a bit small). So we use it with my husband's car and we are thinking about getting a compact stroller that will fit in my car. My major complaint is with using the stroller without the infant carrier. Now that my son is older and wants to see everything around him, he doesn't like to recline. The back is adjustable, but we can't get it to be fully upright, so he is always at a 20 degree angle recline. He has started pulling himself forward and leaning on the tray. It is OK for now, but I think he'll start to get annoyed and tired when sitting forward like this. Overall I would recommend this stroller system
