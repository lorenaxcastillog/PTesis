 I was quite skeptical when this small strap arrived in the mail because it looked so simple. But it worked very well and was a real life-saver. It was affordable and easy to use. I recently traveled alone with my 13-month old and didn't want to bring my stroller. I simply used the Traveling Toddler to attach our Britax Marathon car seat to my carry-on suitcase. It allowed me to "wheel" my son through the airport by myself, while carrying all of the stuff I needed to carry. I had a backpack as a diaper bag, and I was good to go! So simple I even had a hand free. I couldn't believe it. A flight attendant helped with the seat once I was on the plane. The only drawback was going through security and having to un-do and then re-do everything. But once you have the straps adjusted to the right tightness, it's easy to put back on without having to readjust the straps.
