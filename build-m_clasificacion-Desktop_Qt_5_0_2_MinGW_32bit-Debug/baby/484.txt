 The first time I used this excersaucer I was at my sister-in-laws house and she advised to put my six month old in it. At first I was hesitant because I thought it looked too high and kind of unsturdy, compared to my excersaucer deluxe and my excersaucer 3in1. I did end up putting Daireeann in it and she loved it so much that I bought one two days later to take to my after baptism party at a restaurant where I might add was so compact that she did not get bumped into at all. The only thing is mine did not come with a musical pad at the bottom. Just a little tip, if you bend the bar back a little bit it will not bump the babies head and the mirror can be flipped facing a way from the baby. I do recommend this one and trust me I am very picky when it comes to my kids so this is a good choice
