 My son would easily fall asleep, but had a hard time staying asleep. We tried swaddling him in blankets, but he would always escape no matter how tight we thought we had it wrapped. The velcro on the Swaddle Me blanket helped keep him buddled tightly. He would smile at me when I would get the blanket out before he went to sleep. My son was born in the early summer so the flannet blanket worked for awhile, but the cotton blanket was great for the hot nights. My baby was almost 10 pounds when he was born and 22 inches long so I ended up buying the large size eventually. The small size still got a lot of use since we used it every night. My son doesn't need to be swaddled so tightly and likes to have his hands free, now that he is 4 months old, but I will sometimes use the small size for naps. You can wrap it lower on the body to secure the baby's legs, but they can have their hands free. I have lots of friends having babies right now; the Swaddle Me blanket is always included as part of their gift.
