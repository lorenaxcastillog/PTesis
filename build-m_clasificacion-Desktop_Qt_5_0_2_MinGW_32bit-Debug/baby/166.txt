 Monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the AC adapter..... Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged. In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter -- you'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing! (the fisher price rep actually told me I'd "fry it").
