 I received this as a shower gift (I'm a resurfacing new mother - my only child is now 11, so I'm starting over again...) and it was soooo easy to swaddle my newborn son. I remember struggling with my daughter to get her wrapped up in the receiving blanket and in a matter of minutes her wriggling out of the swaddle. With my son, he is cuddly in this swaddle for hours and sleeps soundly. Even my husband, who has two left thumbs can wrap him up snuggly without my help and supervision! My only thumbs down on this product is I notice that with repeated use my son can wriggle his arm out and it does it looser with age. Also, I notice it has a tendency to bunch up at the neck, so you have to be careful when you wrap the little one up in the swaddle. However, the benefits FAR outweigh those two glitches
