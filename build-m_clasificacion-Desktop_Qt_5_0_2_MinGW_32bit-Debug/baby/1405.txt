 Since I consider this expensive I gave it 4 stars...(I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating, it is better than 4 stars) Besides the expense, I'm quite happy with this product. There is nothing else on the market like it...so, we went ahead & purchased it. This is an adjustable child's toilet seat that fits onto a regular toilet. Because toilets come in different sizes/etc. there is a dial(near the handle) which you turn to make the trainer seat fit snug on the toilet. I have found it is easy to place on the toilet plus it is so easy to remove. Some other brands of child's toilet seats are very difficult to remove. The BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer also has an oval shape opening...child's head won't fit through it. A child might try to wear it as a "hat" but it will not go down over their head & around the neck. Neither our son or daughter have had any problems using this seat/trainer. It is easy for them to place on the toilet and remove. Our children do look so much more "comfortable" sitting on this Toilet Trainer seat instead of sitting/falling into the toilet when using a regular/adult size toilet seat. Before purchasing this I also checked out the Toilet Trainer at the BabyBjorn website. I was impressed with the information there. I recommend people consider purchasing the Toilet Trainer.
