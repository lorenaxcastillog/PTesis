 I really like this car seat. I did a ton of research before we bought this one and I can say I am very pleased with it. The straps are really easy to use and do not tangle, it tighten with a pull of the strap in the front. Getting it in and out of the car is also pretty easy. All you have to do is grab the handle on the back of the seat and lift up. To get it in the car you simply place it in the base and listen for a couple of clicks to make sure it is in securely. The only things I have found that bother me is that the baby seems to have a hot and sweaty back whenever I take him out. The material doesn't seem to breathe very well. Also, I have had a few grocery carts that it has not fit into. I found that if I lowered the handle bar all the way back I could sometimes make it work. Worst case, I just place it in the large part of the cart sideways. I have the Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller and it fits into it perfectly. Be sure to have the installation of the car seat checked. We thought we had it in our car correctly and when we brought it to the police station to have it checked, they showed us it was in wrong.
