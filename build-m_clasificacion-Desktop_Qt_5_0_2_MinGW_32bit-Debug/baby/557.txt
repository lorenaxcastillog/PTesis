 This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs. In contrast to one of the other reviews (and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer), this seat does the job adequately, and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs, measurements, fit, etc., IMHO. There is no &quot;universal&quot; seat saver or, for that matter, car seat, that will fit every car. This one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat, and hence, serves its purpose well
