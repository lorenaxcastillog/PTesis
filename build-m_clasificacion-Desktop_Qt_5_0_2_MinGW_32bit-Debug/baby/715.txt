 I really love this system and find it has met all my needs. My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle. I have not found the liner cost to be a problem. Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy. I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough. It just depends on how much you're going to need to store. But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me. Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula! I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats. I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look. But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either. I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers. I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen. This reduces the space needed. When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple. Easy!
