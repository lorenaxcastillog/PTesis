 I love this changing pad; it is great no matter where you are! I have had to change my son's diaper in some crazy places and I know that he's clean on this surface and it's easy to wipe clean if he makes a mess. It has a little cushion to it as well in case you need to use it on hard surfaces and it folds up to fit in my small diaper bag nicely. I really like the wipe pocket and small zipper pocket too
