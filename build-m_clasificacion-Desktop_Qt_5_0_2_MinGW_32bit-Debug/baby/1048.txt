 We purchased this gate to fit around the base of an odd shaped staircase (for those interested, it's the front stairwell of the Wellington plan by Centex Homes - it's really popular down here in Centex subdivisions so I thought I'd share). I was concerned about finding anything that would cover this area because of odd shape but this gate did the job in spades. And it was a breeze to install (at least compared to some other gates). I had it installed within 1 hour. As is usual with these kind of things, if you are installing into sheetrock, be forewarned that the anchors that come with the gate hardware are pooky and you will need to buy some decent ones at the hardware store. That's really my only complaint, but it's seems to always be the case with any factory-provided hardware these days. We are very pleased with it and it was worth the money.
