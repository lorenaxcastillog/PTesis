 I attribute my son's great sleeping early on to the Swaddleme. The velcro is a life saver because most babies can break out of a blanket you've swaddled them in and then you worry that the blanket will smother them in the middle of the night. The only issue we had was when he got a little older and stronger, he would bust out his arm. Usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up. I'd take that any day over trying to deal with a regular blanket. It has an amazing calming effect and helps prevent them from waking themselves up with their arm and leg movements. You also should really go with the cotton because it breathes- I wouldn't recommend the fleece as that is a polyester and doesn't breathe
