 I recommend this product to all new moms without hesitation. This product is awesome! My baby slept for much longer using the Swaddleme. I'm only sad that my baby has outgrown the size large at only 15 pounds (at 4 months), but he seems to have lost the startle reflex, which is the reason he badly needed the Swaddleme in the first place. This is one of those items that is a "must have," and I will be buying for all baby showers. I tried another brand of a similar blanket and wasn't nearly as impressed; the velcro did not stay attached. The microfleece is warm and washes well.
