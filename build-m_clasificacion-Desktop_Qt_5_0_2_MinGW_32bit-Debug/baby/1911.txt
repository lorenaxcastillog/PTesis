 We bought this same high chair 10 years ago when my first daughter was born and we absolutely loved it!! At the time,the only reason we bought it was because they had it in all white and we didn't want one with colors all over it. But as far as the high chair goes we loved every thing about it, super easy to clean and the reclining positions were great for a determined 4 month old..(they always want to be at the table with everyone). Also, many a times my kids fell asleep while eating and rather than wake them, all I had to do is recline the seat and they would sleep with out a problem because it has such a comfy seat cover. It held up wonderfully for 7 years. We thought we were done with kids and got rid of it, now I am expecting again and I have researched high chairs all over again, and have decided that this model is still the best for your money out there. We are buying this again!
