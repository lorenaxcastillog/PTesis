 I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc
