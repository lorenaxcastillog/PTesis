 Started using when he was 5.5 mos & sitting with help. The wrap-around-belt that secures baby even helped him sit up in a cart & kept him secure from sliding or tilting! Now it's even more useful at 7 mos as he reaches for EVERYTHING. The wide strap really holds baby secure & keeps them from leaning over & grabbing things. I hook toys to the strap with 'links' and his pacifier with a clip & he is good-to-go for even an hour+ in a store. I liked the look of the "other" kind that covers the whole basket - but this one is less bulky & has the wide strap for keeping him where I want him! Update at 1yr of age: I ended up buying one of the other types of cart-protectors. The other one was great until a few months ago, when baby just can't be kept still in the cart & leans or pulls feet up. So the other kind became easier as he never hits his head on any part of the cart and also it can be used in restaurant high-chairs
