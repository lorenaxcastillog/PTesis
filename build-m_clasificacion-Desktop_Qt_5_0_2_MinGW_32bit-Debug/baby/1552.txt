 Every since I found out I was pregnant, I've been dreading the purchase of a diaper bag. According to my friends, I carry a ridiculously small purse for a mom (I have a 12 y.o. already)--it's really just a cell phone holder with one pocket with slots for cards and another zippered pocket for cash. I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives --after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag. But, at the same time, if my memory serves me well, a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear, etc. on a daily basis even harder. So I was thrilled when I saw this bag. It came in the mail today (from another merchant) and like another poster, I've been trying it out. It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it --a few diapers, change of baby clothing, etc. And so far, it feels very comfortable. Even when worn in tandem with the PreMaxx New Edition baby carrier I also bought. I will post again once the baby arrives to give an update on this product
