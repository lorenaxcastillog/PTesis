 I love my new stroller. I also have a Graco travel system. The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle. I think the Peg steers very well, unlike what some other reviewers have said. I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it. It handled like a dream. My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened. It was a breeze! We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs. It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok. I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry. You will be happy with this stroller
