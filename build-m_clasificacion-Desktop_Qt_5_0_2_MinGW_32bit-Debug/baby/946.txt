 My son was born in February and I actually considered taking this product back because I didn't think it would be usueful. After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong. I {{LOVE}} this product. It fit perfectly in my infant carrier. Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier. With the Bundle Me I didn't have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold. An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn't need to worry about him overheating. I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back. It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again. I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful. Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great. I already consider it well worth the money
