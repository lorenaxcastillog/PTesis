 I am nursing our 2 wk old, and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us. My husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby, so, he does not sleep well. The snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep. Also, the DVD has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself, because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help. I only wish we would have bought this with second child
