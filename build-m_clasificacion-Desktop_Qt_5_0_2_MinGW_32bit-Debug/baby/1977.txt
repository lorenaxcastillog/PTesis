 I bought this when I was pregnat with my second baby. I love it. It keeps him securely wrapped all night. My only complaint is that it is not designed for larger babies. My son was 10# at birth and he fit in it perfectly. Now at 2mo he is 15.5# and over 25in and the blanket is getting a little small for him. We still use it every night, he just sticks out of the top a little more, and I tuck in the tail at his back instead of in front
