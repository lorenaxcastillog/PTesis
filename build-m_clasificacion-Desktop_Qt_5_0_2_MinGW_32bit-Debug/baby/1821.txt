 We purchased this Fisher Price soft travel tray prior to our 12 Hour plane flight to Hawaii. We have a 2 1/2 year old and she used this for everything on the plane, as well as in the car while we were in Hawaii. The tray is great for snacks, coloring, playing, and pretty much anything else you can think of. It is especially beneficial on a plane as the trays on the plane don't work well with for kids in carseats. I won't go anywhere without this product! It is comfortable as the bottom is squishy so it won't hurt their legs and it straps on so they don't lose any thing. We plan on buying another one when our baby is old enough to use it.
