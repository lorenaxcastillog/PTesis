 These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom. The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff. I lost three bags of milk due to leaks. If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags. They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions. I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.
