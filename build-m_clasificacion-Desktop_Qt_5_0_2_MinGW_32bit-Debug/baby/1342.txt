 I have to admit that I was shocked to read all the negative reviews on this stroller. I have loved it from the day my daughter was born, almost 2 years ago, and am now using it with my son. It's very lightweight and easy to steer. I never have a problem maneuvering it through the mall or in stores, even in the tightest of spaces. My daughter loves that she can sit forward and see the world around her, and I love that she can be buckled into a 5 point harness at the same time!!! After 2 years of pretty constant use and being tossed into and pulled out of my car trunk and my husband's truck, the stroller still looks brand new. The fabric is easy to clean and very durable. I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side. If these particular features are on your "most important" list, I might think about buying a full-sized stroller or travel system, not one of the Italian brands. Europeans just don't understand our fascination with gallon-sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets...just look at their cars and you'll understand. However, if you're looking for a stroller that can function well both as your everyday standard stroller and as your travel lightweight stroller, go with the Aria.
