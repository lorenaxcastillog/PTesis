 This is a great pack'n'play. It's easy to set-up and take any place. The bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that I have. The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby's attention. My only problem is the piece for the top. Whenever I try to use it, the arms bow in and it doesn't look very sturdy. I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground. It just doesn't seem very sturdy and I have tried everything. Other than that, I am glad that I bought this!
