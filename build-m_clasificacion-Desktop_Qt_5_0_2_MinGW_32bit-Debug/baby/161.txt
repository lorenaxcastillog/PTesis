 IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music. I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+ dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud. The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it. I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!! If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud. I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker. I am serious. I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry.
