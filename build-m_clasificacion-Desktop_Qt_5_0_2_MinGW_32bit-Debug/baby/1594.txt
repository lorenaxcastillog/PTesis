 I was debating between this and the Avent pump since I have nothing but Avent bottles. In the end, Babies R Us was sold out of the Avent and I bought the Medela backpack with an adaptor set so you can pump straight into the Avent bottles (Avent doesn't advertise this well). I'm so glad I did. The Avent doesn't have a battery pack so I don't know how you'd use it on a trip unless you don't mind standing in the middle of an airport bathroom pumping. I, myself, prefer the privacy of a stall. Also, no one can tell its a breast pump. The backpack is very stylish and I was able to fit additional items in it so that I could use it as my only carry-on. The design is very innovative which you learn the more you use. Most importantly, I can get 5 oz per breast out in less than 10 minutes so you don't feel like you're waiting forever while pumping. I'd recommend this to anybody
