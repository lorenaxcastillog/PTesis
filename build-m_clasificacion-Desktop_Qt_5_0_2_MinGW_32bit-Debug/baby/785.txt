 I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone
