 I spent a lot of time researching strollers, and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one. Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight, but I have not been pleased with it since. The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat. The snack cup has never stayed in place. Steering this stroller is impossible...we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida. All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego
