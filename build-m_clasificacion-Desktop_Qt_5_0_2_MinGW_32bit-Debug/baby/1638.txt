 This is our second Combi stroller, and we like this one as much as the first, except for the clasp on the belts. We actually cut the belts off our old one and sewed it onto this one! The stroller is sturdy without being heavy, and our children love to have the bar across the front and they really like to be able to sit forward if they want to which is difficult in a regular umbrella type stroller. I have read other reviews saying that if you're tall, it's difficult to push this, I disagree. My husband is 6'1", and he finds it very comfortable to push, as does a friend who is also over 6'
