 We got this seat in a different color for our first baby. We feel very secure with it. Easy to install and a little hint, they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars... you don't need it, you can fasten the seat without the base. the directions for it are on the seat. I like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it, and that it's transportable to our stroller. (bough seperatly) It comes with a head "brace" whatever those things are called to cradle the head. Those never do anything, and are pretty useless, but the seat itself is great.
