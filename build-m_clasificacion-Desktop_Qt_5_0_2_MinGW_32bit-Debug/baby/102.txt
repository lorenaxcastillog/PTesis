 This cute turtle was terrific for about a week. My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options. Unfortunately, the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use. I was the one pressing the button when it came off, and I wasn't being rough or using excessive force. We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily. For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle, but then the rubber sensor fell off as well. With no way to turn the thing on, we threw it away. My toddler was sooooo sad, but it was worthless to us. Since this is overall a popular product, I suppose we just had bad luck. I wouldn't buy another one, though
