 After doing a lot of research, we are pretty happy with this product. We have a 4 year old, a 2 1/2 year old, a 1 year old, and one on the way so we were happy that there was a product out there that could help our 4 year old when she gets tired of walking and there is no room for her in the stroller:) We attached it to our double stroller and it works fine. It makes it a little heavier and awkward to fold up but overall we are pleased with this purchase
