 I know that after looking at the price tag, one might be confused why I say economical; however, when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands (for those exploding messes) - they are a value. These wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe most of the time. Of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe I've ever seen. I have only positive remarks for these wipes
