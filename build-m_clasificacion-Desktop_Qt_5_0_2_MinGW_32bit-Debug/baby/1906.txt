 We actually bought this from the babies r us store and found it to cheaper here. So far, it works well in our loft area. We need to buy another one though, as it wasn't long enough (our store only carried one). My husband installedin one night and the nice thing is that it blends well into our white stairs, you barely notice it's there. Haven't let the baby play up there yet, but it's always nice to know it will be safe when that time comes! Now if only I can find a gate that will work for our uneven stair top
