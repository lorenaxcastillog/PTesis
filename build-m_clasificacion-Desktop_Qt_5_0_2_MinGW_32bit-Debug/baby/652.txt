 This sensor is all about peace of mind. We've been using it for a few weeks now and it's gone off twice - scaring us, but making us glad that we have it. Both times that its gone off, our daughter has been very tightly swaddled, so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm. You can change the sensitivity on it, but the default setting should be fine. There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear. My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes. It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise. It does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib, otherwise the sensor will go off. But this `inconvenience' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you. I believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two. Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room, to the living room, etc. This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny.
