 I love this bumper. The embroidered animals are plush and very cute. Colorful too. Just about any color in the set you can use to paint/decorate the rest of your nursery with. I just wish the inside of this bumper also had the patchwork/animal design on it. Instead it is just plain blue--like the trim on the outside. So, when you walk into the room and look into the crib, what you will see is basically a blue bumper. Other than that, its a nice bumper--the set is great
