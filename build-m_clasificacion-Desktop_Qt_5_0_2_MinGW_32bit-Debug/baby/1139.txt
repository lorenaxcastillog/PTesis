 I prefer the Avent bottles over the Playtex Ventaire brand. They both worked well and have advantages over one another. This is my non scientific review. Head to head comparison: Criteria_____________Comment 1.Bottle Material______Avent stays clearer and is more dense. 2.Bottle Design_______Playtex curve shape is innovative. 3.Nipple Design_______Baby likes the Avent shape better. Avent nipple size is labeled more visibly. The Avent recommended flow rate by age fits my baby more. 4.Vent system________Both work well. No difference. 5.Assembly Ease______Avent has less parts, but the nipple is harder to assemble. Avent recommends wetting the nipple before assembly. Slight advantage to Playtex. 6.Cleanning Ease______Avent has less parts. This is a big timesaver for me. Playtex has 2 more parts to clean. It's a hassle if you are cleaning a lot of them. 7.Overall Quality______Avent bottle seems better constructed. I'm not saying Avent is better than Playtex. I just prefer Avent more. because it fits my baby and my needs better
