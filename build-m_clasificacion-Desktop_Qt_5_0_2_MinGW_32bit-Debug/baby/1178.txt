 I never had much luck with traditional baby carriers. The ones I tried were uncomfortable to wear and hurt my back and shoulders. It also never seemed like my daughter got truely comfortable. I love this wrap because it of it's versatility (which is something most carriers lack) and is reasonably priced. The Soft, stretchy fabric, which is great, provides even weight distribution and makes my daughter feel safe and secure. After watching the dvd, using the wrap is very easy and practical. My daughter especially likes the front facing position, it really lets her explore the world. I do believe using the wrap has allowed us to bond much more in great new ways. After searching and testing various products this is the best! I highly recommend this product.
