 My 2 yr old son was not interested in potty training until this. We bought this potty chair and it instantly got his attention. He went from not going potty to going potty all the time. I bought one for my sister- in -law who had 2 boys she was trying to potty train and couldn't keep them interested and was only having a big mess and within 2 weeks this totally got her boys on track. So I would absolutly reccomend this to anyone having troubles or struggling with potty training and for little boys, the combo of this and peter potty is unbeatable and quick at getting the task done. When we started my son on this, within a week & 1/2 he was in boxers and going all day and night with no troubles. You will really appreciate this!! Good Luck!
