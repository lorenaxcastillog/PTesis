 I purchased this stroller with the infant carrier two weeks away from my scheduled c-section. I was worried that it would be too big and bulky but by that point I was too exhausted to care. It turned out to be a wonderful buy. One of the best features are the rubber tires - they're noiseless and easy to push on any terrain. When I used the infant carrier it snapped in place super easy. I took this stroller to the beach at least 3 dozen times last year and it has weathered sun, sand and a wet toddler napping in it. The fabric dries easily. The cupholders and removeable snack tray are great. It folds easily. The storage basket is huge. It's also lightweight for it's comfortable size and extra features.
