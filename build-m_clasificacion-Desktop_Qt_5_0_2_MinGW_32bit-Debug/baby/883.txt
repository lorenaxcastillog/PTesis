 I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective. The crotch snap does not work properly. When I contacted Baby Trend, they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free, even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 & I contacted them in December - less than a month after I bought it. Otherwise, this is a wonderful seat. I love the triangular handle. I use it with the Snap & Go and have no trouble at all transferring her. If she falls asleep in it, it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her. She seems very comfortable in it as well. She was born November 12, 2006. The hood is such that it can block out the sun, no matter from which direction it is shining. And you can still see her face - if you are tall enough. The product is great - if yours if fully functioning. I'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat. As it is, I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can't spring for another seat now. I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason
