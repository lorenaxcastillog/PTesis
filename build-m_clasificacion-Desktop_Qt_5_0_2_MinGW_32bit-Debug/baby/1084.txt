 My husband and I purchased the "Thomas" bed as a transitional bed for our little grandson who will be two on 3/25. He loves all the Thomas trains and now plays with them on the side rails of his bed. We purchased "Thomas" toddler size bedding and all the accessories for the bed and play areas. The bed uses a standard crib mattress but will need additional support as our grandson grows. If a child is a "bed-jumper" then the extra support will be needed prior to the first jump. This bed is sturdy & made well... even for plastic! When Carl goes to bed we tell him that his bed is in "Tidmuth Shed" and that his Mama & Daddy are close by. Thanks to Amazon & BabiesRus for two years of timely deliveries and excellent products.
