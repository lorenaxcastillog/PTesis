 I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap. Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher. ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS
