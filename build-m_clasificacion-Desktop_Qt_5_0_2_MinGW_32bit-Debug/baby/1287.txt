 I ordered three different items from Liz's wish list and made the mistake of ordering the items gift wrapped from Amazon. Well, the items came today and the boxes the items are in are beautiful, but they're GREEN. I called Amazon and they're refunding my charge for the boxes (almost $14, by the way). You're better off just ordering the items and wrapping them yourself, which is what I probably will wind up doing. Anyway, hope this was helpful to all you Liz and Paul fans out there
