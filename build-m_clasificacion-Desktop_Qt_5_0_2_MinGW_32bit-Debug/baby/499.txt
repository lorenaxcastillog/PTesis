 I love my New Native sling! I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile. My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling. He loves it too, whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in. I've even nursed while walking around..in many places: Costco, Disneyland, Walmart! Very discreet. I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag, so I always have it. No bulky rings or padding. I'm buying them for all my family with babies! I love it, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it. A must have item! Erica Washington stat
