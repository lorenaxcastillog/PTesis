 Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke. Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place. We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use. Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs. Argh!!!
