 After my 20 month old figured out how to "escape", I felt this option was best as I knew if we put him in a toddler bed, the entire family would be up all night hearing him scream at the gate. Pros: really works even for hard-core escape artists, made well, makes me feel much better knowing that he is safe. Cons: Can't hang any crib toys, can't use "The Ultimate Crib Sheet" (which is one of the best baby products ever), your child will HATE it at first, the mesh is kinda rough so my little mad one has red "face burns" from rubbing on it. Biggest downside: TOO EXPENSIVE!!! I feel since this company, as far as I know, is the only one making this, they feel they can charge this much just b/c desperate parents have no other option. Overall: love the product, HATE the price
