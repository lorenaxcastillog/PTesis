 I received these from a friend in Detroit, MI when my son was only a baby. He is now 16 months old and these table toppers have become indespensible. McDonalds, the fish camp, Back Yard Burgers, even the finest restaurants. They stick very well and even if he pulls on them, they are stuck. The good thing is that they do not pull off the finish! He loves the ones with Blues Clues and we go over the characters and fruits that are printed on them while we are waiting for our food. Keep a couple in a snack size zippy bag and put them in the diaper bag. The full bag is just too big. Do yourself and your little one a favor and get a bunch of these. Makes this mommy feel much better about not getting germy
