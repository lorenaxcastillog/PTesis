 My daughter received this as a gift from Mommy when she was about 3 1/2 months. At first, she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face, but if you take off a ring take it higher, your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy. The only complaint I have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child. The mirror distorts your child's vision, so I took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it! My daughter loves it, she could be eating her breakfast, or sitting in her swing and all she'll do is stare at her playmat! A definite must for all parents
