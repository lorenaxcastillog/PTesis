 I bought a cheap carseat. I got it home and could feel the plastic where the baby's butt would be. It was horribly uncomfortable. I went shopping around and come across the Comfort Sport. It's so comfortable and has tons of padding. The cover is a snap to get off and on to clean. The seat is plenty big for my child. The straps are easy to use. It's used in the middle of my Ford Explorer and my boys have plenty of room with it between them. I think this is a good seat for the price. The cheap carseats are just not worth it. I want my child to be comfortable and safe. It was easy to install. I highly recommend it
