 I spent alot of money trying out new bottles with various different nipples sizes. These are by far the best bottles on the market. I have read the feeback other people left about the bottles leaking and extra cleaning parts, but the bottles perform really well. I have never had a leaking issue with them and cleaning is not a big deal considering what the product delivers. The bottle helps reduce the air and gasiness babies get from regular feeding bottles including the over-rated Playtex drop ins. The Drop ins are too costly and still get air inside them if you set the bottle down
