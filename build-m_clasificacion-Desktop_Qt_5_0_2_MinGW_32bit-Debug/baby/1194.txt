 We got this for our son when he was 5 months because going out to restrauants were getting too much. IT lasted all the way up to a year and a half. This model has a ferris-wheel design. It contains a hologram fish scene, a rattle, touch and feel fabric around a ball, and fish toy. It does come off easily and doesn't pivot like the rocking-horse model but will hold baby's interest. Put this together with a bunch of others to have the time to eat and actually get things done
