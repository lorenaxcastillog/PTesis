 I agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had I come to Amazon first, I would not have wasted my money. I got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and, being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight, he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove. So we got and installed these covers. Within minutes he discovered them -- and became even MORE fascinated with the stove! He immediately began spinning them around on the knobs, and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward, the cover and the knob come right off together! Now he had a fascinating new "rattle" to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain. Our solution? We took the real knobs off the stove, period. We keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook. As for these clear covers, they're are still in the closet -- maybe I can use them to display insect specimens or something? Useful as knob locks they are NOT
