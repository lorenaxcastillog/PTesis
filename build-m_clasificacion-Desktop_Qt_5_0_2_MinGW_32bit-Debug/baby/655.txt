 Diaper Dekor is the small, plus is the larger. There are TWO sizes--+ won't fit the smaller unit. We have the smaller and our Babies R Us (which is where we bought it) says "oh sorry, we only carry the big ones now." Nice! Now we have to buy liners online. I don't mind buying online but I don't appreciate that I can't go buy them where I bought the unit. If I'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we'd have bought +. It's excellent
