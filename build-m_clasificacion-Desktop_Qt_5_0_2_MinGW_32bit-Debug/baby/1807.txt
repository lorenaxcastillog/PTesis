 I keep my 2 yr old grandson and bought this in hopes it would stop the mess at potty time.It went everywhere except where it was supposed to go, if you know what I mean.It works great, NO MORE MESS!The only thing I disliked was it was so easy to remove the water container and that is just what he liked to do.Since he has gotten used to it he no longer messes with the container.He uses it, flushes it and on his way.My other grandson was here this weekend and he chose to use it for the first time and did great also. It is a great product and I would highly recommend it.I might be buying 2 more
