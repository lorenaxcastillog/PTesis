 I got this gate for my two Miniature Pinschers and I love it. I use it as a pressure mount in a doorway. I previously had one of those plastic ones with all the holes but I opted for this one not only for the look but for the safety. It is virtually impossible for the dogs to climb over it. It does get scratched very easily, but that doesnt bother me, I expected it with two small dogs scratching at it when they want out! Overall I was impressed with the design and how well made it is. I would recommend this to anyone with small dogs as long as you dont mind the scratches
