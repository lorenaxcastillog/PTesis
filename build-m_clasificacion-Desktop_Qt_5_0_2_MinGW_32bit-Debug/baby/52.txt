 I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed. Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib. There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed. Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space. After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again. It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed. My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"
