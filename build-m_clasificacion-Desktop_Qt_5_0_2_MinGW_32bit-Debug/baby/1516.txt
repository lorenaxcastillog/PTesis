 My only complaint about this potty topper concerns the stick-in-place double sided tape. The peel-off backing is difficult to remove from the tape with out tearing the potty topper. It takes a bit of time to get off, and if you have a toddler dancing around the bathroom stall, doing the pee-pee dance, you don't have the luxury of a lot of time. Also, when the 'deed is done', and it's time to remove the potty seat cover, you again need to be very careful, or the tape will tear off the cover, and remain on the toilet seat. Then you have to pick it off with your fingernail - YUCK! I think a 'post-it note' kind of stick-in-place would be much better than the double sided tape. The seat cover doesn't need to stick to the seat forever, just long enough for my toddler to tinkle. Other than that, this is great. After my toddler finished, I used it too, and found it to be very comfy. It was cushiony, and provided a warm layer over a cold toilet seat. I didn't have to worry about anything leaking through, as it seems to be water-proof. It was large enough to cover the enitre seat, even those large public toilet seats. I will continue to use these, as they do provide the layer of protection I am looking for, but I will need to be extra careful with the tape, until something better comes on the market
