 I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07. when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift. they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time. my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product
