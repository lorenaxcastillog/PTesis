 My son was born nine weeks early and had trouble when the NICU started bottle feeding him. The hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking for him. Once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find to try. Dr. Brown's was the third one we tried and it worked fantastic for him. The nipples fed him slow but did not require too much effort for him. Once we started him on this bottle, he started eating exactly as he should and has not had a problem since. We also had to use Nutramigen formula which also helped with gas and reflux, but for us it was the nipple and the ease of use for him. The downside for us was that they don't fit well in our dishwasher so we hand wash all of them. When we go out we put dry formula in each bottle and carry bottled water with us. When we need to mix a bottle we take out the inside pieces, put the cap on and screw the neck and nipple back on, shake it well and replace the inside and we have no problem with shaking - just take out the inside piece.
