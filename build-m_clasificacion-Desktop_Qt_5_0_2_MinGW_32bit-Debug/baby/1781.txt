 After several attempts to get my 6 year old interested in some form of musical instrument I found this toy. We both love it. It combines two of her favorite things, making noise and playing with water. It floats on the water or sticks to the walls. She is even learning to recognize the positions and names of the notes on the water proof song sheets included and can now play the songs on her little piano and her recorder. Songs like Twinkle Twinkle and Mary had a Little Lamb, etc. I wish they would make additional song sheets for her to learn
