 My wife and I just finished putting this crib together. It took a total of 25 minutes start to finish. The instructions were extremely easy to follow. We bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well, we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two. Our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together. The only adjustments we have done, where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower. Even that process only took a matter of minutes. I have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up. When ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough, but the crib pieces inside are very well packed, padded, and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish. The super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase. I have never wrote a review for an online purchase before, but we are so pleased with our two cribs that I wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib. P.S. I'm a physician and this crib could not be any safer...no solid side walls or backing...just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part
