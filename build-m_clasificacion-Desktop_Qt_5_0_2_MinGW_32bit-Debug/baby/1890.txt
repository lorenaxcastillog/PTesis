 Someone wrote this is good for cloth diapers. Only if you put them in dry. If you put water (with additive of your choice) to put your diapers in, this is dangerous: babies (ie ones old enough to get about and pull themselves up) have drowned in diaper pails. Esp if they step on the front and the lid pops open and they try to reach inside. headfirst. Only use a diaper pail that latches solidly closed if you are going to put in cloth diapers that you soak. For dry diapers of cloth or disposable variety this is a great buy
