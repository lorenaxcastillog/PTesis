 Both my husband and I love the sling bag. He enjoys not having to carry our big pink bag - too girly for him! Fits EVERYTHING we need. So many compartments and very comfortable. Keeps hands free and not having to keep a big bag on your shoulder! I love it - so easy for those short, quick, busy trips! ALL MY FRIENDS LOVED IT! One friend wanted one for her twins...that much room. Another friend said it would be perfect for her upcoming plane trip. A third friend said it would be a perfect Father's Day gift
