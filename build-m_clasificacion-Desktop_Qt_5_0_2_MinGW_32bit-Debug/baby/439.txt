 This mirror really isn't worth the money. You'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby, that's about all this thing does. The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror, kinda hard to do driving down the road. Also, the music isn't very loud, atleast not loud enough to get baby's attention when upset, which is what I was hoping for. And the lights aren't very bright. Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out. Also, the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards, but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat, it doesn't stay in place that well. You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror
