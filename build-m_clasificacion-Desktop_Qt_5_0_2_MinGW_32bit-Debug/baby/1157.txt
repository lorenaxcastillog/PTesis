 I bought this tub for my baby who is now almost 11 months. I used it since the day we came home from the hospital. I used the mesh and it was wonderful. The mesh swing seems very flimsy, but I used it until my baby was almost 4 months old; it held her weight quite well. My baby is tall, so I do not know if I will be able it to use beyond her 1st birthday. I am playing it by the year. All in all, it is a great tub at a throw-away price.
