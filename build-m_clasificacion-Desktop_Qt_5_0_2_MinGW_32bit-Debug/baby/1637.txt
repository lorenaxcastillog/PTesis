 They look awful but if you have sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they are the only thing that will really fix what's wrong. The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies- you won't have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time. They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell. These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don't have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over. I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me. NOTE: don't use them to collect milk to give to your baby as one reviewer suggested. The milk collected in a breast shell is to be discarded as it states in the package instructions.
