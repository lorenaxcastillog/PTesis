 I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump. I was wrong. Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once! Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.
