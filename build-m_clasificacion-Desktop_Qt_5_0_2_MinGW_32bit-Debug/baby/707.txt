 This is the best carseat out there. It's above the Peg Perego and Britax. It weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm and it is so easy to adjust. The best feature is the base is designed so that it does NOT MOVE in the car. I've had Graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when I made turns because they just weren't secure even with the special belt clip. The only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it's job. 5 stars!!!
