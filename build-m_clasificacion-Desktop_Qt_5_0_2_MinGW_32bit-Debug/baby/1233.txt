 My husband and I received this warmer at our baby shower and while it was great to not have to walk downstairs to warm the bottles for early morning feedings, after Sofia hit 5 months, we never used it again. She's 9 months old now and it sits on a shelf in her nursery waiting for baby #2. I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I'd give it as a gift. I say that because it'll get more mileage than the typical cute outfit and will cost the same.
