 The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby. I don't have inverted nipples, I have 38 DDD or E breasts which were not to easy for a little baby to get a hold of the nipples with all of the extra flesh smothering her face, I know that sounds weird but hey... everyone has their own problems with breastfeeding in the begining. I just needed an extra boost so that my daughter could get a good latch. I stopped wearing them after a couple of weeks after she got the hang of it. Like I said... The most useful thing I have had since I had my baby. It really calmed us down in an already stressful time
