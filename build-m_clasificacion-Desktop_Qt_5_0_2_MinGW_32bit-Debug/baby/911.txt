 my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more. I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face! Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night. This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends
