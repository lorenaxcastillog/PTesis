 My daughter received these instruments as a gift last Christmas and took to them right away. She was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds. We have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites, just the right colors, size and shape with just the right sounds! She has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys. They really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children
