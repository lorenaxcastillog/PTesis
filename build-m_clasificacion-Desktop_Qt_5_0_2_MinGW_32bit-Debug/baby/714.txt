 The only bottles my daughter would take were the Playtex Original Nursers. I am pumping at work with a Medela Pump in Style, so I was pumping into the Medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the Playtex Drop-ins to feed her. It was a hassle and I never felt like all of the milk, especially the fat, made it from the Medela bottles into the Drop-ins. And then I heard about this kit and bought two immediately - I have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the Drop-ins. The only downside: you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump
