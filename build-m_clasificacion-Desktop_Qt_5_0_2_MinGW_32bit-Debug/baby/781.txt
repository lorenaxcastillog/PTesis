 After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller. I am glad we didn't listen to those naysayers. It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful. The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish. Yes, the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is. We've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains (Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto) and it rides smoothly. It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters (2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant). I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor. Also, we love the capabilities, spring shocks for a smooth ride, shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers. We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk. As for the weight. Yes, it is heavier but come on, it is not "10" times heavier. People exaggerate too much. If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms, then the stroller is nothing. People are too much of a wimp. It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much. They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy. Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life (my two daughters) are protected. The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying. Just use Silicone spray and they all went away. We've been through rain, dirt, and hot sun with this stroller and we've been so happy with it. I highly recommend purchasing it. but make sure you have a truck, mini-van, or SUV. I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller. But I figured if you have two toddler/enfants, you may consider getting a bigger car
