 Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant. Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their "holes" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big "footprint". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table
