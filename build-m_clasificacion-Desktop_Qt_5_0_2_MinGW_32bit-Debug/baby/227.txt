 We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase. First of all, we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work, since they make you order each little piece separately. We spent all night putting it together and it didn't work for us. The actual gate is very small, I don't see how it would be big enough for any opening. Even with the extension kit, it was still not long enough. The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart. It is a very poor design and way overpriced. We spent over $150 (with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart. Save your money and buy a different gate
