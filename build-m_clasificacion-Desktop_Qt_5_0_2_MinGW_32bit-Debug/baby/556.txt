 I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding. This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger. I highly recommend this bumper. It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard. There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are. I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath. I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it. I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers. Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did. HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers
