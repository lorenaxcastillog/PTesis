 I used this with my daughter. The only time it leaked was when it wasn't snapped in right. We never used the music (was thinking it wouldn't be beneficial and she'd want to put toys in it to make the music go). It was a lot easier to clean that our other potty chair. There's a little 'trick' (if you can call it that) to unsnap it before pulling it out instead of just pulling it all the way at once. Lightweight but sturdy. It has a back which feels more like a real potty. And she had no problems sitting on it. Obviously, we never used the pee guard (which is easily removable)
