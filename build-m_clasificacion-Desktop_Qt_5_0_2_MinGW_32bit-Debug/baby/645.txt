 We have been swaddling our 8 week old since she came home from the hospital. We tried the Swaddle Me, but I guess she was too small (7 lbs.) We were using the Miracle Blanket which we loved. However, as she got stronger, she was able to kick and squirm her way out. I got worried about her safety with a loose blanket in the crib, but she really liked being swaddled. I took out the Swaddle Me that I received at a shower and decided to try it again. It worked like a champ, and she is sleeping 7 hours at night now!! I stretch it so that it's as tight as possible. I bought another one, and the velcro for the feet is bigger - even better to hold it down. We LOVE it and highly recommend!
