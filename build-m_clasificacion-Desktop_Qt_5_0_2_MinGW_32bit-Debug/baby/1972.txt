 I really wish I had considered the Metrolite graco system because registering for this one. It is way too big to use on a daily basis. I love it for places like the zoo or park but it is way to wide and heavy for daily mall, grocery store, errands in general. All in all I think graco has the best features on strollers, definitly the best basket and parent trays but I think I will try to sell this stroller and get the Metrolite so I would use it more.
