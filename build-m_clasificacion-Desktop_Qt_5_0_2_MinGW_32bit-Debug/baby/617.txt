 We bought this swing for our 11 month old daughter, and she loves it! We attached it to our back porch easily enough, and she swings in it every day! We've had it for about a month and it is still her favorite toy! The only issue that we have had is that it hangs slightly crooked because of the way that they put the hooks on the swing at the factory. The aren't both facing the same direction, which is something that we cant fix, but it isn't bad enough to not use the swing or to cause any problems. Its more irritating than anything. Also, the swing seems secure and safe. We've not had any issues with safety, or even any close calls
