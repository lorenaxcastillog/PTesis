 I bought this carrier b/c i saw my midwives carrying their babies in it at the maternity center - they highly recommended it. well i bought it. our son has been in this carrier since he was born in October, we are in april and he still rides in it and he weighs almost 19lbs. and babies that are in these types of carriers seem to be the happiest. they spend 40 weeks with you, what makes you think when they are born they want to be away from you. it's also great for babies with colic it is the best wrap EVER!!! 1. this creates no pressure points at all!!! you DON'T feel it in your shoulders or lower back. as a massage therapist i highly recommend it b/c it does not ruin your posture i do feel his weight in my thighs - which for me is fine - my legs are getting stronger 2. i breastfeed him with the shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him in my arms - wherever we go - restaurants, etc.. and people never notice they think he is sleeping 3. you can put the baby in different positions 4. they take the best naps in it 5. be prepared for all the attention and questions as to where you bought it and how it feels 6. it it soo easy to put on, but you MUST WATCH THE VIDEO it comes with. once you get the hang of it - it' a breeze - i put it on in less than 30 seconds 7. and instead of looping the wrap through the rings to hold it in place i just tie it into a knot 8. you have TWO free hands ENJOY!!!!!!!
