 I am sure this is a good stroller (that's why I bought it!) My "review" is more of a word of caution: this thing takes forever to arrive. Don't be fooled: "Usually ships within 24 hours" really means "May ship sometime". As of 2/8/06, our stroller has not arrived. It was ordered January 1, 2006. It is not even slated to ship for another week (we'll see...). Meanwhile, the local store has several in stock. My advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion: go to your local store. Otherwise, be prepared to wait a very long time.
