 We used this gate to separate a large room into two sections to keep the little ones out of the big kids' activities. For the price it was really worth it to us. Basically now we have two rooms instead of one, minus the scary paranoia that babies may choke on the small part toys. We've had it for 6 months, it is still perfectly intact and looks superb. Since we are APO (overseas US address) the shipping is always very tricky. Usually companies charge huge rates and ship it slow boat making tremendous profits alone on the shipment. This company, the Pegasus Shop/Safe baby Shop did exactly the opposite: small shipping cost and ultra fast shipment. We got it just in a few days to our surprise. Since then I had to deal with the business with other inquiries and they are wonderfully honest and helpful. 100% satisfied
