 I was lucky enough to happen onto the Baby Plus..ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? That's what I hear from people. If I want I can sleep in, and I have been able to since my daughter was 2 months old. I can take a nap.She hardly cried and when she did it was a pure purpose cry, food. I saw my daughters eyes alert and amazing from the moment she was put in my arms. She has exceeded where she "should" be at this point in her life, 22months. Our bonding from the minute I put on the Baby Plus till now..awesome.Every heartbeat brought a reaction. I can't believe this is my daughter and neither can my parents:) Was I ever this good? No! My husband's family is the same. How could we have such a beautiful, smart and calm 22 month old? LUCKY?? Nope, Baby Plus! Sure she's a 22month old at times but she's smart as a whip and I will use Baby Plus again! Thank you for discovering and making this product! I will love my child no matter what but I LOVE the addition this has brought to my daughter. 22 months and I am soo lucky! THANK YOU!!
