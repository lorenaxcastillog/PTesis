 We originally wanted a stroller/car seat combo, but we received this as a shower gift. We love it! Our infant Graco Snug Ride carseat actually fits into the stroller (facing whomever is pushing). My husband loves the iPod connection, it works well as best I can tell. The tires are easy to inflate, I was able to figure out the air pump to inflate the tires with out any instructions. I also find that it has a lot of storage capacity for shopping. It is not super easy to steer with one hand as I sometimes have to do when my baby wants out. The stroller is heavy to lift in and out of the trunk and it does not fit in all cars. It can be awkward to lift and stowe ( watch your fingers )and it takes up a lot of space. It does collapse using one hand, but its not as if you could do it while holding your baby or anything else so it might as well be two handed) Also, I find that it is not the best a steering in small isles in stores, it tends to get hung up. However, it will ride over most terrain quietly and with little disturbance to your little one. It has two cup holders in near the handle, but I find that they are usually too small. I read once that they were designed to fit a Starbucks cup--My Avent bottles do not fit well nor do bottles of water. Overall, I would recommend this stroller, its well priced, durable and functional.
