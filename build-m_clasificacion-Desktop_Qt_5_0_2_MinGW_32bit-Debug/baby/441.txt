 I don't even know where to begin. Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids. (1 1/2 and 6 months old) Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him, she would cover her face and cry! He would go off all by himself, which was really creepy in the middle of the night. And he broke after a couple of months. Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house. He's defantly not worth the mone
