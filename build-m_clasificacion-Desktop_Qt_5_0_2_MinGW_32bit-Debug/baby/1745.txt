 I love this diaper bag. First, it doesn't look like a diaper bag. It can pass for a purse and looks very sporty. I don't feel like a frumpy mom while carrying this. Also, it carries quite a bit without looking bulky. I regulary carry wipes, diapers for my infant and my potty-training toddler, plus at least one change of clothes for each child in the two larger compartments. I still have room for my keys, wallet, cell phone, sun glasses, and a hair brush in the two inner zippered pockets. I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap needs a little more padding. But, overall, it is a great diaper bag.
