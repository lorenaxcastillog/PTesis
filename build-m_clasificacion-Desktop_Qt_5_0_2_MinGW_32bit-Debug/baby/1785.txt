 My twins are 3 months old and have been sleeping through the night for a month because of these blankets. They are super soft and keep my babies nice & warm during cold nights (especially their hands). I worried about them pulling their blankets over their faces at night and swaddling with receiving blankets wouldn't hold them (they wiggle a lot) so these are the perfect solution. I'm ordering 2 more in the large size to get us through the winter. I highly recommend and will be gifting these to my expectant friends in the future.
