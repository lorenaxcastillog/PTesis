 Even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning , it fits perfecly. Evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it. We needed this piece for our size opening , we really had to squeeze it in , but it is a great fit. The gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye. It took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism , using 2 hands at first. After some practice it was easy to use. We liked it so much that we bought another .
