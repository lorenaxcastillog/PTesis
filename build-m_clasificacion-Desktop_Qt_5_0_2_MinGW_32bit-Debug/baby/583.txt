 I bought the same brand, but maybe an newer/older version of this? It didn't have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned. However, it DID have an Infant Tylenol equivelent, which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet. The gas drops are fantastic - thank goodness we had these, especially when we had to change his formula!! Anytime our son was "fussy for no reason" we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time. The saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds. The aspirator works fine, I've never tried a different one, so can't compare. He didn't care about the teething toy, and doesn't care for the taste of the teething gel, but it seems to work. It also has two cooling wipes which we haven't had to use (no fevers yet!). Overall I was really glad to have this, and to have all these things together in a nice case I slid right under his changing table - no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night. I'd recommend this to all new moms
