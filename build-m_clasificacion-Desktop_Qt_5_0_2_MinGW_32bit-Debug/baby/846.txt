 I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it. He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems. I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing. I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps. Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it. The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge. I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day. Otherwise, I have no complaints. Excellent product and service
