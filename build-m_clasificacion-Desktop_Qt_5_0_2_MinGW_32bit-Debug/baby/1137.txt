 This swing is wonderful for my 1 month old girl. She likes being in the horizontal position so the way the swing is designed is perfect for her. although, I do think that the swing should be adjustable so she can sit more upright in the future. The size is fantastic! I have a very small house so I couldn't get one of the mongo designs. Plus, It is very easy to move room to room. The mobile is very interesting to her and is positioned in the perfect distance and position for a newborn. I can see it beeing a problem though in the future when she gets bigger and more mobile, because it is so close to the cradle. I would deffinitly reccomend this swing for newborns, but not so much for the older, & larger bab
