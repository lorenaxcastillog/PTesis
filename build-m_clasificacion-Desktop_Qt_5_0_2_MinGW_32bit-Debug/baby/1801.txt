 i received this as a baby welcoming gift back in oct 2003. i have used it every single time we need a shopping cart and LOVE it! i leave it in the back of my car and grab it when we go to a store. almost everytime we're out, i get someone asking me where i got it. i wash mine probably once or twice a month and it still looks fabulous! my second child is using it and loves to eat a small snack off of it while we shop. i am buying one for my friend who is due next month and will buy for all my future expecting friends! perfect gift and dearly loved
