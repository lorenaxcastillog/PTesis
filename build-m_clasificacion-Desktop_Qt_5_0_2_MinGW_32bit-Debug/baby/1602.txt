 I live in Northern GA and when I got pregnant I lived in Southern LA, never thinking I would need something heavier than a blanket for my infant son. After the first morning of scraping the frost off the front of my car with my 4 month old son waiting patiently inside the house for the car to warm up, I realized that I was wrong. I have the Graco Windsor Snugride travel system, so I ordered the Celadon Bundle Me, thinking that the two greens would match. It is not a perfect match, so I probably should have ordered the graphite instead, but as far as the product goes, my son loves it. I even unzip the top cover and use it as a mat when we play at friends' houses or when we visit family as a top cover in his Pack and Play. My son likes to snuggle down into the Bundle Me and I like that I can just unzip part of it while we're driving if he starts to get hot. I definitely suggest this for anyone who lives in a somewhat chilly area. I will probably invest in the Lite version once spring arrives; anything so my son doesn't have to get bulked up with a sweater or jacket just to be comfortable in the weather
