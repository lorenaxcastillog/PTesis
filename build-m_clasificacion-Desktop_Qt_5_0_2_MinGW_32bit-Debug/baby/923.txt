 I am surprised to read that people don't like this mirror. We have had it since our son was 1 mon. and we still use it at 7 mon. We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat. It has been great for road trips (our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store. We don't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy. We have never had trouble with it being too soft. I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well. Def. recommended.
