 Love this gate - we have 2 blocking stairs and kitchen. One comment on installation - you MUST use the measure tape/ruler they provide to locate where the gate hinges are fastened to the wall, that's why the top will pop out (on an earlier review). Eyeballing it is not the way to fasten it. There are specific heights to install that make this gate safe. Will be purchasing one for the top of the stairs as well, and have no doubt it will be fine. They provide good long screws, so as long as you have a banister or stud, you'll be fine.
