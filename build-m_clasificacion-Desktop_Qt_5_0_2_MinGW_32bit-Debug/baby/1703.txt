 I purchased this for my daughter when she out grew her baby tub. I didn't like the plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt. This is a very soft ring. It is definately for kids that can sit up on their own. I had other friends use this and they loved it enough that they also purchased one. It also comes with a nice hanger to hang it on the towel bar in the bath tub -- I didn't find it too heavy to hang
