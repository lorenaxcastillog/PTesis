 Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe. This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins. When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints. She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size. We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug. The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily
