 This crib makes our nursery! Every person that has seen the room comments on what a beautiful crib this is. The wood is very thick and expensive looking for a very inexpensive price. The crib is very sturdy when put together, and with no movable parts (the front piece doesn't lower) it is very safe for the baby. Knowing that this crib will grow with my baby through toddler and childhood years is reassuring too. I'm glad that I purchased this crib! You can't beat the quality for the price
