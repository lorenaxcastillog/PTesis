 Well, I can't give them too bad of a review since this is the only pacifier my son will take. However, I can't give it all five stars either... For one, this pacifier is really bulky compared to other pacifiers. It almost looks like the nipple you would put on a bottle...it's that bulky. Second, there is an attatcher that attatches to the pacifier and clips to the baby's cloths so the pacifier doesn't fall on the floor, and that is even more bulkier than the pacifier. So using the two of them your baby is almost consumed with this pacifier. I guess my biggest beef with this pacifier is more cosmitically. It's an ugly pacifier. Besides it being ugly, it's a pretty good pacifier. I like that my son didn't have a problem with nipple confusion due to using this. From the moment he was born he just had a high need to suck and I just couldn't spare my breast for the whole entire day, so we had to give him a pacifier. He never had a problem using this pacifier then nursing on me.
