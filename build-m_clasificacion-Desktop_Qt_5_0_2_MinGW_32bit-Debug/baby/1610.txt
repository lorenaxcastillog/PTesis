 I searched all over every store in what seemed like the world just to find a sleeping wedge for my 3-month old preemie son. He has very bad acid-reflux and sleep apnea (he forgets to breathe when he's sleeping) so he absolutely had to have one. I bought this for him and he's been sleeping trouble-free ever since. The height may only be 2-3" but it works really well, because any taller than that (I actually bought another one to try under the first one) and his poor little head will fall over and he can't breathe. We have him in a cradle and thank God I found one that fits it
