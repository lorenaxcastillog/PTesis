 This jumper has been great. My son doesn't really like to jump in it, but he does love to play with the attached toy. Plus it has loops on the straps so I can attach my own toys to it too. I bought it thinking he would spend a long time jumping away, but as it turns out, it's just a portable "exersaucer" that he plays in (which is great for travel, or just another place for him to play). Had I bought some of the others on the market without the toys, he would be very bored. Maybe my next child will use it to actually jump? ;
