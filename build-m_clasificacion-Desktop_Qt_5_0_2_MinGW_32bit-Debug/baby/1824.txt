 I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant, and so far I've been very pleased. I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I'm out running errands. There are just a few parts, so assembly, disassembly, and cleaning is very easy. But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds, but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby.
