 My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended
