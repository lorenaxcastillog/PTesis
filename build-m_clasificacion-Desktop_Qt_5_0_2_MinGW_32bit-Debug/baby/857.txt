 I bought these strap covers: 1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and 2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time! This product solved both problems. When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft. Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat
