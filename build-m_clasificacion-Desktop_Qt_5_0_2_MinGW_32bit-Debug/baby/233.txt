 I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came. Well, the "mattress" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry. I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all. I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface. Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed. If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars. I'm so let down by this product
