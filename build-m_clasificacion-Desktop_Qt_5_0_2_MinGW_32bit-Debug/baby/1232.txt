 We switch to this warmer from a very disappointed First year Night and Day warmer. This one at least will not burn our hands when taking out the bottle. The water inside will not come to boiling point. It will still overheat the bottle if you leave the bottle for too long. The light does not seem to be helpful. It keeps the temperate at too high level. However compare to the First year one, you do not have to be precisely accurate at the water level (which was a pain when you use the First year one at 3AM with your sleepy eyes) and you will not get a mess of water around the table, so I'd recommend this product. Also, the warmer kind of make a 'tick' noise when it is on so it becomes a reminder that the warmer is still on, which is a good thing
