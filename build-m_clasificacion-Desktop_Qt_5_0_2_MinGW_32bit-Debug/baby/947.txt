 With my second baby due in Feb - I knew I would need something to keep her warm. I purchased this product and LOVE IT! The color is beautiful, it is snuggly, warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it. As she is only 4 weeks old, it can be a little big (how to explain?)... it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down. But it is a great product and I'm sooo glad we got it
