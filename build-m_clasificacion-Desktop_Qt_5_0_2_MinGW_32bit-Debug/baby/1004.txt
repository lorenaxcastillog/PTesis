 Sadly, I too found the Kwik Cabana III to be a terrific item ... the first time I set it up (inside our house, of course). When we actually took it to the beach and tried to open it up under "real world" conditions - Jersey shore in early September, and not particularly windy - one of the four support rods snapped at the top junction. We now own a $100 collection of poles and fabric, but not a cabana. It's too bad, because it's really a great design and so lightweight. Hopefully the manufacturer will design a stronger version (which I'd buy again)
