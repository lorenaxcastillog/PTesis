 This monitor is pretty good. It pick up my little one's little noises so I can get to her before she awakens. It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars (which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long). I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service. I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up. Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working. I was able to send it to Fisher-Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days! (no questions asked
