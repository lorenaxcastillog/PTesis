 I cannot go shopping without my floppy seat! I don't know what I am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy. I reccommend this to everyone who comments on it, to purchase for themselves or as a gift. I have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on, or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection, but I can't remember where (babycenter.com, $60?). As other reviewers mentioned, I also used mine for the restaurants too, when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats (not to mention the gunk in the chairs!). Buy this product - you won't be dissapointed
