 We waited until our daughter was [...] to get her this, and it's fantastic! She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...] I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it. (It was a poop-eroo for us too.) A few things that I learned using this though is: The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it. It is incredibly hard to clean. The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside. My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it. I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet
