 I bought the smaller version &quot;Diaper Decor&quot; (as opposed to the larger &quot;Diaper Decor Plus&quot;) about 18 months ago. Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon. I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor. It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me. I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size
