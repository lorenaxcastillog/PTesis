 Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat. Then pull them out the correct places. Not so easy. Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back. This is very hard. So once there together it is a pain to take apart. For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket. You shouldn't have to do that. Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat. Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you. This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM. We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts. What is the point of that. Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.
