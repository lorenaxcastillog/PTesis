 WE decided to use cloth diapers because it's SO much cheaper than disposables. The Prefolded diaper service diapers are definately the way to go too. I couldn't do it if I had to fuss with folding. Also - if you plan to cloth diaper - a MUST have is 4 - 6 diaper wraps (10$ for 2 @ BBrUs). They are like plastic pants only with waterproof and cloth covering. They also have velcro instead of pins. My hubby (who hates wrapping anything) LOVES and OFFERS to change our newborn's diapers since he can easily handle the velcro wraps. We did a diaper cleaning service for the first 2 months, and I clean them on my own since. IT's really not as difficult as everyone thinks it is. Plus it's great on the environment. I strongly recommend cloth diapers and wraps
