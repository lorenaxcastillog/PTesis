 I bought this set for my baby when she was 6 month's old and they quickly became her favorite. She has a box full of small toys/rattles but she always ends up grabbing for one of these. I like how flat they are which makes it easy to tuck one into a small diaper bag so she can have musical entertainment when we're on the go. My baby is approaching 1 year and still is intrigued by them. I anticipate years of fun with this toy. A great purchase
