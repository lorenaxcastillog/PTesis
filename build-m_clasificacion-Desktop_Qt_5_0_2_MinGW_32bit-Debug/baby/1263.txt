 My daughter is 3 and we are working hard on potty training! I got this as a gift when i was pregnant and I love it! There is an occasional smell I noticed if I let the bag fill up too much. But that is simple just empty it more often. I like that the refill bags last a long time. I do admit that I do sometimes put poopy diapers inside another bag before I put it in the daiper pail (just to make sure it won't smell. In the 3 threes I have had it I have only brought 5 refill packages and in comparism to diaper genie that is nothing. The refill packages were a little pricey (my local Toys R Us sells for 9.95 a box)but it is worth it and like I said,they last! My daughter knows to take her pull up off when it is bath time and she throws it in the dekor diaper pail without touching anything. I wouldn't want the diaper genie where I have to change something every other day-I dump mine out once a week-love it
