 The reviews are right. My four week old is captivated by this. I can put her in her crib awake and she goes to sleep. She used to cry. The only problem is I wish the timer was longer or even better noise activated. I have to go back in a turn it back on a few times, but I believe this one has one of the longer timers. If you are having a problem putting you child to bed. GO GET IT!! If it had a longer timer I would give it 5 Stars
