 I have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it!! The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs. To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access. The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other. There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff. There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag. The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage. Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly. I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable!
