 I began using the system when I was 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up the schedule with a fast pace career. I stopped when I was about 31 weeks. I thought that my efforts went down the drain and did not try to look for any benefits from Baby Plus. However, when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have. I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son's development. He never had colic, has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born, laughs as if it's rolling from his toes since he was 4 months, latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words, not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he's memorized for his favorites songs. I highly recommend this product
