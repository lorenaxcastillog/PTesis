 I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year.
