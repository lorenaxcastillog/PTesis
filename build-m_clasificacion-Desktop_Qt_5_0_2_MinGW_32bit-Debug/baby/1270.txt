 We use this on our second child, and it does help him sleep *much* better. I wish we had had it for our first child! We own both the fleece and cotton versions, and I prefer the fleece - it does not get loose as quickly as the cotton one does. Despite the name, this is not a swaddler by itself for any but the most placid and plump babies. Our kid can easily work his arms out (usually through the slit between the arm wrap and the bottom pouch) if he is fussy. However, we still use this daily - on TOP of a swaddle done with a recieving blanket. This way, the swaddle does not come undone. Yes, you could do the same with a diaper pin, but things stay together much longer and much neater with this than with a diaper pin (or even with a second swaddle done with another recieving blanket. I haven't found a good way to use it with a car seat in which I feel comfortable - a swaddled kid has his legs together, doesn't he? - but we do sometimes use it, cocoon style, in a Baby Bjorn or sling carrier, and it can be quite magical at being soothing
