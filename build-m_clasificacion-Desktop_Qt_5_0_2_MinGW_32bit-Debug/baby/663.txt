 This jumper is worth it's weight in gold. My son is 3 1/2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so I decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion. At first he was a little wobbly, but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around. I have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper. I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy
