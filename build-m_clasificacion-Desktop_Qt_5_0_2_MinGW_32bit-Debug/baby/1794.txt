 My daughter loves this toy. She got it for Christmas. I didn't have batteries for it for a few days, but she played with it even without the sounds & lights. She loves the phone that hangs from it. I finally got batteries for it, and it kept her entertained quite a bit on our 11 hour trip to the beach. The remote came in handy. I'd just hit a button, & it would light up & play music for her while she was in her car seat. Highly recommend!
