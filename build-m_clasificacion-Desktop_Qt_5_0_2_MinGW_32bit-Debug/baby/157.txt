 My baby slid both down and off the side of this. I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner. I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me! She could have suffocated! I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy
