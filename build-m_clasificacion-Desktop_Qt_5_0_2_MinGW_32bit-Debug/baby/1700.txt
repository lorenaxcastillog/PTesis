 I must say that this is a really good car seat/stroller. We needed it for a long trip from Europe to Oklahoma. It made it sooo much easier. Then when we got to the states it was great for the ride from the airport then the other cars we had to use. As we were waiting for our other car seats when began to love it even more. We were able to go from car to mall, church, movie, store what ever with ease. The only thing we didn't like was that it didn't have an umbrella or something to protect for shade and it isn't suitable for rough areas like gravel or large brick areas. It tends to move funny around those kinds of areas other than that it has been great
