 We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly. At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!) The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us
