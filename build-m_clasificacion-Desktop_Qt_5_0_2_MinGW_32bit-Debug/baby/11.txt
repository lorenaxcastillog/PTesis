 I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there
