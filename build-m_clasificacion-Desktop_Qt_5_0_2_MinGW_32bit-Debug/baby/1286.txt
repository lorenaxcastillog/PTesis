 This is great. We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place. He loves to hang out in here and play. He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it, it's even safer. It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him. It gives him alot of room to play and crawl. He can stand up and hold on to the sides. He even stood by himself! The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot! We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with. This is portable and light. It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together, it's pretty sturdy. It's also indoor-outdoor, which is great for people with backyards, decks or pools. Folds up very compactly. You could easily store this in a closet when not in use. Overall, it's a great product to have and well worth the money. I highly recommend it.
