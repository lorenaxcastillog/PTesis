 We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so. We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!. I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something. But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight. It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco. It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not. I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning. Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable. Definitely worth every dime, we love it. I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...
