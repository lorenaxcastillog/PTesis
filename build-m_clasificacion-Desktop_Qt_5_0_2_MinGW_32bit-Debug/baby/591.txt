 My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son. He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old. The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it. Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time.
