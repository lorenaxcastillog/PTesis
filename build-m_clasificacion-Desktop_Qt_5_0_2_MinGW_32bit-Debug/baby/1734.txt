 We needed to gate off our basement stairs but it is a large opening and there aren't two walls directly across from eachother that we could put a gate between. This gate is the perfect solution because we could install in an "L" shape. It works great, the gate is easy to open (but not so easy that my son can do it), it is stable and sturdy and I no longer have to worry about my son climbing the stairs. It is a nice khaki brown color that actually matches our wall color perfectly. I like that it's not your typical white metal "prison bars" gate.
