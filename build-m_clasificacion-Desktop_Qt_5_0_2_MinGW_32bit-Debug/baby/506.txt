 We purchased this gate for an odd sized opening, because it is expandable. It attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side. We have the gate in a very high traffic opening, and it is not only easy to open and close, but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out. In the evening when the kids go to sleep, we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side. I love it so much, I'm buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have. Works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also. Quality, durable product. I definitely recommend it. Target is the only place I have found this gate
