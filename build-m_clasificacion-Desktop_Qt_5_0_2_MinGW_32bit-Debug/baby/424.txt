 This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so. As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off. You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door. It just isn't going to hold up. It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money
