 We've used this since our baby was born three months ago. It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use. The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around. Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children. We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting
