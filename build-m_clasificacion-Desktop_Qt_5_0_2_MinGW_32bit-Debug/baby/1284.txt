 I received this Baby Bjorn as a gift before my First Child was born in February of 2004. I used it with her up through about 9 months of age. Then when we had our second child, I pulled it out and it has been the best thing. She loves to be in it and it has saved me from having to put her down when I am chasing my first child who is now a 2 year old. I recommend any new mom to have one and it is such a great quality it lasts a long long time, it is worth the money. If we decide to have another child I will definitely be pulling it out again.
