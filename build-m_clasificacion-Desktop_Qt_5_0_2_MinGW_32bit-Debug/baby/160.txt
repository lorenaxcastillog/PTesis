 I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all, therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation. I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy. I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working. I would not recomend this pump, at least not to adoptive mothers. The customer service was awesome though!!! They were understanding and helpful. I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela.
