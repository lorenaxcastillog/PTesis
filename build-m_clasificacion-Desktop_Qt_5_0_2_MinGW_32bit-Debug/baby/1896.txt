 This crib was easy to assemble and it is very pretty. I like how versatile it is for the price. I put it together by myself and 6 mos. pregnant in an hour. It was very easy to do. One concern I had was that some of the pieces were missing paint in some spots; nothing extrememly obvious that wasn't eventually covered up by the mattress. I have several more weeks before I get to actually try it out, so my rating is based on looks and assembly only. I am confident, however, that it will stand the test of time..
