 I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area. I was totally wrong!!! Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand. Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry, 'cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it. Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose, so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly, the bottom one is to lose and not secure. I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it, only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes. I would have returned this gate, but I trashed the box before I installed it
