 I LOVE this pillow. I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly "hang" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable. **UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash. Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new. I also like that, yes, it does take up some room, but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows. All in all, whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice
