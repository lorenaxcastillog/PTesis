 This is a must have for moms who like to keep their kids secure in a shopping cart, as well as clean from yucky germs. My son is small for his age and the regular strap in the shopping cart doesn't fit around him corrrectly...he is 2 and we still use it. I tried the big cart cover that covers the entire seat and he just swam in it...this keeps him secure and safe. As well as away form the germy, yucky cart handle. I also like that this fits in my diaper bag better than the big full cover cart cover. A must have by far!!!
