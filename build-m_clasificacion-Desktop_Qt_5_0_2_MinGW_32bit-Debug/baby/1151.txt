 I love the new and improved Diaper Genie!! Our original Genie was constantly in need of a new film canister, and couldn't keep up with the smell of my two babies diapers (3 months and 2 years old). The Genie II, on the other hand, has had NO ODOR since day one!! The film also seems to last longer, since there is no wasting it by "twisting" a chunk of film with each diaper. This produuct is much easier and effective than the original Genie, and I absolutely suggest it to all of my friends!! FINALLY!! A diaper pail that actually works!
