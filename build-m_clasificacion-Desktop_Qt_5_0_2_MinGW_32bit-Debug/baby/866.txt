 I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews, in that they claim this piece is flimsy. It is NOT at all flimsy, nor does it look cheap. In fact, my husband and I have the entire set (changing table and dresser), along with the Montery Crib. When you receive the boxes, there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer, not the store, will handle all returns, exchanges, or shipping of missing parts. Well, we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect. We spoke with Storkcraft directly, and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly. Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant, and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY, and they would arrange for a prompt exchange. This piece looks beautiful, and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser. I am sure that you could spend $1,000 on a high-end piece, but if you are looking for something that is 1) AFFORDABLE, and 2) WELL-MADE, and 3) BEAUTIFUL, then Storkcraft is a good choice
