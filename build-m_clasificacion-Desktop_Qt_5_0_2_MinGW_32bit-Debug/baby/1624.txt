 I have had this mattress for 3 years now. My daughter started using it as a newborn and is still using it on her toddler bed at age 3. I have had no tears or springs popping as described in another review. I guess you could buy a 200 dollar mattress for your kid, but does it really matter? Have you noticed how little kids can sleep on ANYTHING? Kids can sleep in the car with their neck bent 90 degrees to the side for 3 hours just fine. They also fall asleep on the floor without complaining. This mattress is soft and fits cribs nicely. What else do you need? Mine has held up just fine. All in all it has been a good crib matress and I would probably buy it again. If you like wasting money, you should buy a pillowtop mattress with 12,000 springs for your kid. Otherwise, just save money and buy a basic one like this.
