 After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno
