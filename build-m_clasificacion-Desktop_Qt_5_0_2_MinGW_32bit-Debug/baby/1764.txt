 My first son took to breastfeeding like a champ from the get-go. I never experienced sore nipples with him. My second son is a whole different story though. For some reason my second son just didn't want to open his mouth wide enough to get a good latch on, so that made for excruciatingly sore nipples for me for about the first two weeks of nursing. It was torture - pure torture. A nurse at the hospital gave me these gel patches to help with my sore nipples and I must say, I don't know what I would have done with out them (I probably would have given up on breastfeeding). I tried the nipple cream and that did help a bit, but these gel patches are really what made breastfeeding manageable for me. I healed faster wearing them than I did with the nipple cream. If you put the patches in the fridge for a couple of minutes then put them on they feel really great. This is a wonderful product and I attribute them to getting over that huge breastfeeding hurtle for the first two weeks.
