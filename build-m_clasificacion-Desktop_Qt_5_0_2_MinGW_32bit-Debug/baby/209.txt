 I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use. The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of. Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use. It was very unwieldy to travel with. It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable. Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke. The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs. I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average. Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster.
