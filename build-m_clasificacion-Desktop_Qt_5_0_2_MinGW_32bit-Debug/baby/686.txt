 We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old. Even though he was still a little "floppy" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong! Although, now he wears "real" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast! We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat. As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair. The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts! We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!
