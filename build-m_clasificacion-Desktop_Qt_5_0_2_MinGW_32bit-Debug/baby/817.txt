 I received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver. How nice that I can monitor my baby's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute! The are two different channels, so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off. Sometiems it's also just a matter or re-positioning the monitor to resolve the noise. We were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls, but switching to channel B solved that. I've used the Evenflo Whisper Connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied
