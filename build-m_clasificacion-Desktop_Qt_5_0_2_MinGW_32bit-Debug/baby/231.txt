 I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed. I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon
