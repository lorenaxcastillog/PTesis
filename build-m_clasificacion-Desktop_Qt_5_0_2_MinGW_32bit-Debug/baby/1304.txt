 The Embrace is extremely comfortable. My wife loved it when compared to a friend's Medela. One complaint though....it does pump a little slower then other pumps.....but the extra comfort is well worth it! Playtex has awesome customer support. My wife accidently tore one of her valves (little white points that fit under each cup). She called playtex and they immediately FED EXed her 4 replcement valves for free. They only asked that we return the torn valve(s) for R&D. Be careful with the valves they are a bit fragile and if you tear one it adversely affects the suction of that cup.
