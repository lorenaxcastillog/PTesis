 I got this product b/c when we first put our daughter in the highchair when we went out to eat she immediately wanted to touch the table. I was fine with it until I wiped the table off and was disgusted at what I saw. The tables at most restaruants aren't always cleaned with clean rags. Now, as she's older and eating some puffs and other finger foods, it's great b/c I can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers! I keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it's dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty. It's such a simple concept product, but so GREAT! The only complaint I have is that sometimes it doesn't stick very well.....
