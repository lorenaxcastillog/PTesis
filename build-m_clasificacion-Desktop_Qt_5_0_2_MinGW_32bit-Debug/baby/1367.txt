 This is the most comfortable carrier I have tried, and the easiest to put on. The shoulder-cupping theory works well in practice, at least with my son who is 7.5 kilos right now. The carrier itself is well made and the clasps are nice to have instead of having to tie it on. I would say that mobility is a tad limited because if you have to reach for anything high up the shoulder strap slips up around my neck, but otherwise I was able to do stuff around the house while wearing my son, and we were both comfortable
