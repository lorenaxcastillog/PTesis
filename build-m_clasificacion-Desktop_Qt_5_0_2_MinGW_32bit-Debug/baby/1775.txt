 Our son is almost 16 months old and we have been using these sippy cups for about 10 months now. We have never had them leak, mold, spouts push through or anything! I suggest reading the directions before tossing these sippy cups in the trash. I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of "hype" just because they failed to read directions. As for the complaints about mold and sour milk...that's just gross. Wash the sippy cup after it's used. I'm sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer...not Avent's fault! Anyway, as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean...OK, maybe for the first few times because they are new; but they WILL get more pliable. I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison, NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so (same for nipples with Avent bottles). They do wear out...especially if you're using the same two or three sippy cups every day. I just bought (and tried) the "sport spout" and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out, our son has no problem with that spout, either. No leaks so far. All in all, read the directions and you will see the leaks disappear like MAGIC! Good luck
