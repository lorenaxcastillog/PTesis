 We have both an Urban and the Lite Bundle Me. I'm glad we bought both! The thicker Urban has been great in the colder weather. It's thicker, and so stiffer, than the Lite, which makes it easier for me to zip up in the carseat and then fold the 'flap' down to leave my daughter's face exposed. In windy, cold or nasty weather I bring the flap up to cover her completely for the short outdoor time between car and destination. The Lite is flimsier, and was perfect for early Fall and I'm starting to use it in the stroller for warmer winter days. I personally prefer the stiffer Urban, but the Urban is so much warmer than the Lite I'm glad to have both. Switching the 2 is very easy and takes only a minute or two. With both versions, we just put on a hat and the baby is ready to go! No jackets or snowsuits needed. We also have a set of Cushy Straps (cute fleece animal-shaped covers for the stroller/carseat straps that cushion the straps AND help keep the child's head from lolling around) and those help keep the top of baby from being too exposed when you have the Bundle Me folded down or partially unzipped
