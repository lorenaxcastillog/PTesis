 Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course. Note: We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's them
