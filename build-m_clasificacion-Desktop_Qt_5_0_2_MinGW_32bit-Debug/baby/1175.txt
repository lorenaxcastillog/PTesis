 First off, there is not one baby carrier that does it all. This wrap is absolutely amazing however. I would recommend it for when you will need your hands free for an extended period of time. I use it for walks, traveling, and around the house if my baby just wants that close contact or is fussy. Once you get the hang of how to wrap this you can get them in and out in just over a min. My baby takes super long naps when in this and is so comfy and so am I. My other carrier that I have hurts my back after awhile and I suffer for days; never with this carrier. There are so many positions for this too. I found a website with a European carrier that shows better pictures and one more position, same idea.[...]I also found that it is easiest to put it on when first folding the wrap in half lengthwise, then spreading it out when secure. Though it is not as easy to nurse with the baby in this carrier, it is pretty easy to take them out and put them back once you are used to the sling. If I had it my way I would have this (for long periods up and about, and fussy babies, or for those with bad backs), a sling (for newborns and nursing), and a backpack (only for short trips, like laundry or carrying groceries up). If I had to pick one however this above all would be it!! One more thing, it is ok to wear this in warm weather, just dress accordingly (you and your baby). The pocket is a plus as well. Oh, and I do find it easier, once on, to get baby in and out of than a back pack or front carrier. This also is suitable right off the bat for new borns and many stages there after
