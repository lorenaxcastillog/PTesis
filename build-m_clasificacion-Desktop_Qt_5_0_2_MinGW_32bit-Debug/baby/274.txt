 I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected. The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but I don't quite get how to adjust this. It also says that there is a blanket. Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here. I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does. At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1/2 inches thick. I'm pretty disappointed. I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby's sleep problems
