 This stroller would be great if your kids doesn't fall asleep while riding it. The Sit-n-Stand stroller doesn't recline. If you have kids who might fall asleep while you shop or just take a wall around the park or block it can be very uncomfortable for the child. This stroller is good for quick task. It is just meant for Sit and Stand as the name it is given. Also, to fold this stroller there is a trick to the front wheels. It is not very hard to steer this stroller; it fits fine in my Honda civic trunk while I still have plenty of room for a diaper bag as well as a few filled shopping bags. All in all an "okay" stroller
