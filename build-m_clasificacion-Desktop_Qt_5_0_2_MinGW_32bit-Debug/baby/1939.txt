 I love this bumper. The only reason I got this to begin with was because when I removed the old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads, which I realized weren't safe, my 4 month old would squirm around, and his legs or an arm would end up sticking out of the slats and he would get stuck. So I realized I needed something to block the slats. I was happy to find this new breathable bumper to keep his arms and legs in the crib. My only concern was whether or not I'd be able to easily change the crib sheet once this was installed. And I can! My husband secured this bumper (velcro pads) extremely tight all the way around. Spend the few extra minutes to do that (it takes 2 people) and then you will not have to remove the bumper to get the sheets off! I can even completely pull the mattress out of the crib to get the sheets off easier if I need to, and the bumper stays in place since it fits so snugly against the sides of the crib. It's almost like it's not even there. I HIGHLY recommend this product
