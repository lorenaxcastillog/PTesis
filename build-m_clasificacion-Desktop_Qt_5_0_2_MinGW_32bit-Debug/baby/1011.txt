 Goregous Stroller!!!! We had those cheapo umbrella strollers but our 2 1/2 year old was to tall for it, and it wasnt wide enough, she looked very squished. This came in the mail today and its perfect!!! Light weight, tall handles with light padding, nice break system, beautiful colors/materials, our toddler is not squished she has plenty of room (shes 35lbs, 37" tall)I dont feel hunched when I walk with it, great place for a storage pouch, wide and long canopy. Its just perfect well worth the $$. Im buying another for our new son for when hes old enough. Great deal!!!! Buy one!!!!! :) Im very happy
