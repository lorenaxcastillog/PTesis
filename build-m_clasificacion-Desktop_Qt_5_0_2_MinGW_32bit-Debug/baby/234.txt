 Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial. It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth. Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing. I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing. This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model. Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap
