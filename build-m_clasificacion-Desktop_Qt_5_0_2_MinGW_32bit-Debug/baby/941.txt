 Our little one LOVED this toy until he turned 8 months. Now its really a challenge to try to get him into this thing or the Baby Einstein stationary entertainer (see my review for that). However, he will still play with it standing OUTSIDE and loves touching the legs and toys and chewing on the bar. Unfortunately he puts up a fight when we try to get him in it. But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it. He would bounce back and forth and say "AHHHHHHH!" and just laugh really hard. So glad that someone gave this to us and we didn't have to buy it. But if you are making that decision, I say it is totally worth it.
