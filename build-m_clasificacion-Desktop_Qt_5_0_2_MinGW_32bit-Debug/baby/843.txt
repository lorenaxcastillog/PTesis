 I've tried other cart covers and this one is the nicest. It's big and, well, floppy! It's padded so it keeps my son comfortable. You can put it on the cart with one hand. I have to put my son in and then do the seat belt through the back. It works great. We leave it in the car and use it everywhere. I bought it because when my other son was a baby he got really sick a few days after a trip to the grocery store. I've seen programs about what's on those cart seats (people put their raw meat in that section of the cart all the time - yuck) I feel much safer now!!
