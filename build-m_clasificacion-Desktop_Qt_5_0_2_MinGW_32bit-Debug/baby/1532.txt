 I tried a few boosters before settling on the Britax Parkway. First we tried the Jupiter booster. My daughter is a tiny girl (5yrs.old- 36 lbs. 43 inches tall). She was way too tiny for the Jupiter. The shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder and her head wasn't supported when she slept in the car. Another thing i didn't like about the Jupiter was that the padding under her bottom felt too thin and she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides. Then we tried the Graco. It is a good seat. But no head support unless you lay the seat back a ways. I didn't like the plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter's cheek sleeping on it. Next we tried the Parkway (Britax). This booster is by far the best booster on the market in my opinion. I am a huge Britax fan. All my kids have been britax babies. My 3 year old and 4 month old currently sit in the Marathon (britax). This booster has enough padding to keep the kids comfortable, the head rests keep their heads from flopping. My daughter likes the way the fabric feels (she is very sensitive). Even though the Graco booster seat looks like the Parkway, and the Graco is $50 less than the Parkway, I still didn't like the fact that the red seat belt guides (on the Graco) looked like they would hurt to rest my head on. Britax thought of everything with this seat. I HIGHLY recommend this seat. Fork over the extra cash and splurge on your child's safety!! You'll be glad you did
