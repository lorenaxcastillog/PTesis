 My 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs, so right from the very beginning, he's been in the big tub with a tub seat. He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU "house" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch. I can't say enough good things about this tub seat. The head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn's delicate head, and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows. The two-position back reclines for newborns, and sits up straighter for older babies. The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub, but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water (in the old tub seat, he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in). One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn't sit up in it. The design of the Mother's Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted, and the ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself on the hard edges. Even though there's lots of support and padding, it's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this (or any) tub seat. Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I'd like to respond to: *There are no suction cups on the base: I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction, but tubs may vary. *She would like a strap: the seat that I have does have a strap (it's stored underneath the seat, so may not be immediately identifiable), so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently. Overall, my son and I are very happy with this tub seat, and I've been recommending it to friends. They'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down, though. I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it!
