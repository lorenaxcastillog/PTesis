 I bought 3 packages of Dr. Brown's (through AMAZON.COM) standard size nipples and I received 2 standard and 1 wide. They shipped the wrong item to me. I returned the wide to the address in Calabasas, California and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to RIGHT START. I enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him. Since my purchase, I still have not received anything except this email from AMAZON.COM. I rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star
