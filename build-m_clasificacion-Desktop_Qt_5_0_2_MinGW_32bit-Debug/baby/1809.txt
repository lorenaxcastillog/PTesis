 I just purchased this for the cool, wet spring months of New England. I also have the Bundle Me Original which was great for the winter months. This is a nice alternative when the Original becomes too warm to use , but you still need a little something. The inner lining is soft against your baby's skin and the outside lining protects him/her against cool weather and rain. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it does not fit as well on my car seat as the Original. It tends to slide down a little. I have the new Graco Safe Seat which is larger than most car seats so this could be the reason. It may fit better on smaller car seats. I also love the pink "girly" color. Now that the weather is warming up a bit, it works great when going into air conditioned buildings that are just a little too cool for baby. It is also a nice barrier from the sun's harmful rays
