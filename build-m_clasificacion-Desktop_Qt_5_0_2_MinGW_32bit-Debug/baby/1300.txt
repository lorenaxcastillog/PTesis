 I'm writing this review to tell other potential buyers that this "universal" car seat carrier does not technically fit a Baby Trend Snug Ride infant car seat (another great product). The description listed on this web site states that it does. Instead of returning it, my crafty husband made a few of his own alterations to keep our baby girl safe. Ultimately, I was looking for a universal car seat carrier that was black and/or gray instead of navy blue, and this is what I found. Despite feeling misled, I'm rating this carrier four stars because it serves its purpose very well, especially for those who have an infant seat that is actually compatible. My only other complaint is that the basket is difficult to access
