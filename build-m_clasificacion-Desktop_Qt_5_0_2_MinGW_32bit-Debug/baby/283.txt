 I got this to make sterilizing easier. I'm not sure it does. It is kind of a pain. Cartoonish in appearance, cheap looking, cheap feeling,not nearly enough room for what you have to put in, you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things. Water does spill like crazy from the lid. Does it really sterilize? I hope so! I can't tell. Air vent bottles air dry, but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have. Why? I don't know, the steam? Metal of heating unit isn't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don't get cut! I was VERY disappointed! For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality! You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure!
