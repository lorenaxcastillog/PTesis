 This seat is a wonderful transition from our daughter's Roundabout. The reasons why I could not give it 5 stars are the following: poorly designed cup holders; an early tear in the fabric; no secure anchoring. Cup holders: we've already spilled juice that's been left in the cup holders. They are completely useless and should have been better designed. Fabric: though the material looks resilient, a tear has developed near the lower left corner where her leg sits... I am assuming that this is because the chair is mounted behind the driver's seat, and therefore it gets a lot of traffic as our daughter boards and disembarks the car - nonetheless, we expected something a little more durable. Anchors: the seat wobbles around and doesn't really hold our daughter in place. She is often reaching over to pick something up, and the seat nearly topples over. I am not sure why this wasn't considered in the design. It makes it easy to remove and install, but I'd rather have something a little more stable
