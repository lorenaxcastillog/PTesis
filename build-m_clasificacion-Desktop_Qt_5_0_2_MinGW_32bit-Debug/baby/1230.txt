 I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place. As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually
