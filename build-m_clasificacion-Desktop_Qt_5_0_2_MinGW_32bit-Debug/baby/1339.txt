 We loved the idea of this item...we didn't use it in our bed but in the crib instead of a bassinette, when we were away from home, or on the sofa. Our son was 22" at birth so he outgrew this (unfortunately!) by the time he was a month old. It is really only suitable for small babies. Also, the "mattress" is split in two due to the folding capacity (not sure how else to do this though) which makes it seem somewhat less comfortable. Only one half has a removable, washable cover.
