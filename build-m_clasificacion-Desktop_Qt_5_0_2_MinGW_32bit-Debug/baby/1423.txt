 I bought this based on the great review given by the previous poster about her colicky baby. Thankfully she was NOT wrong! I have a 5 week old who has been fussy and high need from the moment he was born. During the day he would only takes nap on me in a carrier and at night he would only fall asleep in bed with me and my husband. My arms and body were getting tired from carrying him all day. He would never sit in his bouncy seat for more then 5 minutes so I was hesitant to purchase another piece of baby equipment thinking it would not help. As I type this he is taking his TWO HOUR nap all by himself! I put on the nature sound, which is white noise, set the swing on the highest level and WOW, I was able to take a shower today for the FIRST time since he's born without someone holding him. I never wanted a swing, but now I am a FIRM believer in the power of motion for an infant!
