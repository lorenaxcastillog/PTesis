 After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats, I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit. The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it. No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey, I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort. For now, I'm sticking with the Britax
