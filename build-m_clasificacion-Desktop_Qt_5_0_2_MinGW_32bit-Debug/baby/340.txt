 We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but, the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close, and hard to open, specially the one that goes between the legs, it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them, and is complicated to align them to finally buckle. In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips
