 I am a first time parent of a 4 month old. I was surprised to learn that babies can't clear their own noses until they are about 3 years old. I tried using the manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated and I would have limited success clearing his nose. It usually took several attempts to get into the nostril and once there, I was only able to get good suction about 1/3 of the time. Maybe others have better luck than me but these are my stats. I ordered the NasalClear about a week ago. I was concerned that the vacuum might be too strong for little noses or that the tips would be too invasive. The vacuum is very gentle. I prefer the shorter, stouter tip as it seems less likely to go too far up the nostril. Either tip is certainly shorter than the one on the manual bulb. The suction, while being gentle, is very effective at cleaning the nostril. I was surprised by how much a little nostril could hold. That being said, the NasalClear comes with a collecion cup that has a max fill line on it that seems absurdly large. I have yet to get even a drop into the chamber (there is quite a bit of storage space in the tubes leading to the chamber that does get filled) so I can't even imagine filling it. I don't find the music feature to be very important. It's a great product that works well and doesn't irritate my baby. So far, there hasn't been a tear caused by NasalClear--which is a huge improvement over the manual bulb
