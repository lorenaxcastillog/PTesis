 This is a terrific car seat if you plan on keeping it in one car. If, however, you frequently swap car seats between your cars, or want to have a car seat that you can bring along when you travel by airplane, this isn't it. I bought this seat when my 3rd child outgrew his infant seat. Compared to my previous one (a Century ovation from 1997), this is plusher and the harness straps really don't get all twisted up. But I'm still hauling the old Century car seat out every time we fly anywhere as the Britax Marathon is just too big.
