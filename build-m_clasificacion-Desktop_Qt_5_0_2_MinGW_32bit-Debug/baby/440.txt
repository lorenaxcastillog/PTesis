 I was very disappointed in this mirror. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all. I registered for this because of the remote control feature. Well, the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit "on" (remote control access mode) in order for it to work. There's a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music. You cannot control that feature from the remote control. You also cannot control the volume from the remote. It's really a pain. I'm keeping it because I like the mirror but I'm not happy with it. Save your money and buy the SafeFit Baby In Sight mirror.
