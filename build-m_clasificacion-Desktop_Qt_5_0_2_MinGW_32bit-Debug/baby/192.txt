 Some assembly is required. I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things... I have an engineering degree... I've put together bikes, furniture, installed car stereos, and this thing was an absolute pain, especially for such a simple device. I found the instructions to be woefully inadequate. I found the images to be useless, and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together. Takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance. It was aggravating enough to make me go straight to Amazon upon finishing to leave feedback... I didn't even buy it from Amazon. The gate itself is fine
