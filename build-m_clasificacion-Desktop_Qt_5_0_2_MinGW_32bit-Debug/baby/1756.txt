 We just recently purchased this stroller as we were traveling and our other stroller just broke......I looked at several different ones the store had to offer and thought this would be the best. It offered all the features we were looking for, reclining seat, storage area, cup holders, lightweight and compact and all for a good price. So far I am very happy with it. Our son loves the toy bar and the cup holder. It is easy to assemble, easy to steer and adjust the seat. It folds up with just one hand. Right now, I love it !
