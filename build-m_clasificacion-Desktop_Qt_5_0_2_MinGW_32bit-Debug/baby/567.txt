 I got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend. It worked great even after many years... I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag. It takes up less desk space (no extra space required for the bag). Also, it's more portable if all you need is the pump. I pump all over the house (study, bedroom, living room while watching TV with my husband). Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast). I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference. I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm.
