 The Swaddleme is an awesome product if your baby enjoys being swaddled. Our baby slept best when swaddled, but could often work his arms out of the blankets that we swaddled him in. We found that he stayed swaddled longer, and thus slept longer, when he was in his Swaddleme. I gave my sister one when she had a baby, and she loved it so much, she ordered two more. I couldn't find a local store that sold a large (when he outgrew the small one), and thus ordered it from Amazon.
