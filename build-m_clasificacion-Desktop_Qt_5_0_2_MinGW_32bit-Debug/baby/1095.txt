 I am very pleased with this sun shade. When I first received it I thought I got scammed because it looks like nothing. But it does the job very effectively. It's super easy to attach and when not needed the shade pulls back out of the way. Depending on the angle of the sun, I can have it partially or fully extended. I've used ours for almost a year and it's held its shape. It also packs up very compactly for traveling. It's the best I've found for maximum sun coverage. It fits both my full size Evenflo travel system stroller and my lightweight Peg Aria, which has a very small canopy. On my recommendation my cousin got one and it works on her full size and her small Zooper also. I've read other reviews complaining it doesn't fit but I've tried it on many strollers of friends and it works. I think you just need to be creative in how you tie it to the stroller. I expect this shade will work on most strollers. I can see that some kids may dislike the reduced field of view when the shade is fully extended. I started using it when my daughter was only 3 months old so I think she got used to it. She's never had a problem with the reduced view. My cousin started using it recently on her 11 mos old and her baby doesn't fuss either. I now give this sun shade to every friend with young kids. It's a great and inexpensive shower gift. It's one of those things you can't live without once you have it
