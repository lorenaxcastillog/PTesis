 I live in a relatively small townhome, and my son's baby gear has taken over most of the space. Between activity mats, jumpers, swings, and kicking contraptions, I couldn't bring myself to buy a full-size high chair. I actually bought a Bumbo Seat, hoping I could use this instead of a high chair, but that didn't work out too well. So I was pretty excited when I saw this high chair and read good reviews. I'm happy to report that I love this this high chair! The vinyl seat is pretty plush and looks comfortable. He actually looks like he's sitting on a little throne when he's in it. I strapped it onto a barstool, and it feels very secure. The vinyl seat, along with the rest of the chair material, is easy to clean. The tray says dishwasher safe, but my dishwasher is too small to accommodate it. It doesn't seem to be the highest quality chair, meaning some of the functions aren't as easy to use as you might hope, like the reclining seat and the tray, but it wouldn't deter me from buying it again. It was only $50, so I wouldn't expect it to be any different. It's also very portable, which isn't a normal expectation of a high chair. Overall, I'm very happy with this product
