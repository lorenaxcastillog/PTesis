 We've been using this stroller for our baby girl for abt 2 weeks now and this is just a perfect stroller. Its got good grip and wheels are big so moves nicely. Car-seat goes in and comes out in a snap. Folding this stroller is easy - cant say it can be done with one hand but doesnt take much effort and you dont have to sweat it out while closing/opening. Has canopy on Car-seat as well as the main stroller, together both give a complete cover from rain/wind.
