 This is a great idea, which I really thought my baby would enjoy since I had read they loved to be swaddled. But my daughter did not like to be swaddled at all. So I ended up returning this product and using our Halo sleepsacks instead, which gave her hands and feet more freedom. My advice is to purchase only one of these before birth and then if your baby enjoys being swaddled then purchase more, if not you can return it or not and not feel bad that it was only $9.99. Also remember once babies can move their hands around more freely they should not be swaddled.
