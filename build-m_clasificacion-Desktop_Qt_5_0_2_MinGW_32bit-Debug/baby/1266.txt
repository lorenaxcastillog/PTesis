 I didnt have a monitor with my son so I wasnt sure what to expect. I thought there would be a lot more background snow but there isn't it is very clear. We have a vaporizer running all the time in there but when my daughter cries, her voice is very clear through the vaporizer sounds. The only thing is that I wish the monitor was a little more portable, maybe a battery backup. A minor inconvenience. The 2-way speaker is awesome. When I shower and she starts to cry, I can calm her with a little conversation and get a couple minutes to dry off.
