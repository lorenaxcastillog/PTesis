 I did lots of research about which convertable car seat to buy. My daughter was 6 months old when we switched from her infant carrier; she is a big girl (about 19 lbs. @ 6 mos.) and she fits wonderfully in this seat! She looks SO comfortable and hasn't fussed once since we have put her in it, she used to fuss quite often in the carrier. This seat has plenty of room to grow and makes me feel safe with her riding in it, this price is on the high side, but how could you compromise the safety of the most wonderful thing you have?! I must abmit that the seat is quite bulky and probably wouldn't fit great in a small car, but I think it is perfect for our 4Runner. I have seen friends with other seats and I must admit that there is a definite difference in quality; Britax spared nothing! I wouldn't think of putting my daughter in anything else after owning this seat
