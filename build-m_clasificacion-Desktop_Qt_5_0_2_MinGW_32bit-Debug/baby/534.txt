 My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.) My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
