 The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name. As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice. I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither. It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime. By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor. The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs. It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering. Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese! The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached. The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby. I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'. I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK". Back it goes. If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!
