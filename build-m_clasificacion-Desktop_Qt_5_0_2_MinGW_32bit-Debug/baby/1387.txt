 I literally had every pad out there imaginable. I had the Gerer pads, the Medela pads, Curity pads and the hospital pads. None of them add up to the Advent ones, I even had the Especially for Baby pads those are actually just as good as the Advent pads. What makes them two pads slightly different is the Advent pads come with the nipple indent. I have both pads if your money concious the m buy the especially for babies brand. The advent pads hold so much fluid, it's not even funny. I leak so much all the time and it doesnt seep through my clothes. All of the other pads were to thin for me, and the tape that the others have is useless because it doesnt really stick to the bra
