 I am a pretty picky shopper, but I have fallen in love with this product. My now 6 1/2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place I could ever get her to sleep comfortably. She still sleeps in it (at 18 pounds, it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out). There is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies. Save the money you'd spend on a co-sleeper, swing or a bassinet and try this instead. I buy it for every baby shower I attend.
