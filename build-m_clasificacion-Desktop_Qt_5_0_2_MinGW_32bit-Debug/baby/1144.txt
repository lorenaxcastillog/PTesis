 This was a lifesaver for our premature baby girl! The fabric is soft and she seemed so comfortable in it when she first came home. She is now three months old and would rather swing or play in her gym but for the first month she put her glider to good use. So even though we didn't use it for a long time period, it did a great job of soothing her and I am glad that I bought it right here from Amazon with free super saver shipping!
