 My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them. I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct! All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!
