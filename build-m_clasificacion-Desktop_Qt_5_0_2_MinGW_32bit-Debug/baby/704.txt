 We loved the mini co sleeper! Our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy. I loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed. I could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and I didnt even have to roll out of bed. The mini co sleeper was so portable that I never even bought a pack n play. We traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us. I highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high. I will use this for our next baby as well
