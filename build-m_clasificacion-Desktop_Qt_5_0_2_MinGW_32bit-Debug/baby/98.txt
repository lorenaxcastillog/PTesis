 We have the All Clear Swing Gate (hardware-mounted, not pressure-mounted) installed at the top of our basement stairs. Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand. Fortunately, enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance (just!) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs. But it was a close thing. An inch or a pound or a second either way and I -- or, god forbid, one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured. While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge, the gate itself, which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge, fell off and tumbled down the stairs. The gate has been in place for six weeks, but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks. NB this was a product failure, not an installation fault. The screws are still firmly attached to the wall, along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge. I purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here, but after my experience tonight, I would not recommend that anybody buy this gate, ever. (The review gives one star, because NO stars is not an option). And I would expect to see a product recall very soon
