 I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story. Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted. I bought it because it was lightweight, had a front tray, adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color. I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk. Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips. Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria: - Poor steering. Can not handle quick turns. - Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun. - 5 point harness is poorly designed. The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled. - My drink holder broke. - Overpriced for features and quality. My positives are: - Nice looking - Easy to fold - Lightweight I keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company. Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room! I would not buy a Peg Prego again
