 this bed is better than I hoped for! My son, at age 16 months decided to revolt against the crib, and opt for mommy and daddy's bed instead! We were very leery about putting him in a big boy bed at so early an age, and this bed seemed to be built the toughest and safest. The transition was amazingly better than I could have ever dreamed of! My son LOVES this bed and not only started sleeping through the night again, but naps in it as well! It is totally cute, and the design is such that even a tough tosser/turner as my son won't fall out - unless he wants to! Even then, it is low enough to the ground so no injury occurs. I HIGHLY recommend this bed
