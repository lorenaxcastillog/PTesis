 These are really good bottles. I have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son. My only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns. The flow is MUCH too slow. My little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried. So if you plan on using these bottles, I would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby. I am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples. Other than that, these bottles are great
