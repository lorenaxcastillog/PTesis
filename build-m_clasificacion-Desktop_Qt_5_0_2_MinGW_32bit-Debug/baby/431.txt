 I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son. It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub. It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub. The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub. There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub. He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth. There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay. His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while. I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured.
