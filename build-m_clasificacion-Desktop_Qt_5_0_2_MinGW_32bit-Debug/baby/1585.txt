 My 4 month old was losing interest in this toy until I purchased 4 new things to add on and now he loves it again. The nice thing is that you can keep changing and adding toys as interest fades. I think this will still be fun for a toddler to climb under the arches as a sort of obstacle course type play. The durability of this product is excellent too. I have not been able to keep my 6 and 8 year old children out of it! The 10 year old thinks it's pretty neat too. Not only do all of the children use it, but 2 dogs love to climb all over it as well. Durable and entertaining
