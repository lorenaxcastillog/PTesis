 I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib. I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them. She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these. Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards
