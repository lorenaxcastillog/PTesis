 I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller. Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow. The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view. An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier
