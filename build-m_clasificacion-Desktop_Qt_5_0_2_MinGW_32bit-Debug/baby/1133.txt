 My Husband and I are expecting our first child, a little girl, in July. We received this as an early shower gift from my grandmother and absolutely could not have asked for a better gift. It rides smoothly - everything is very easy to snap together and it's not complicated to figure out. There was minimal assembly which my husband did for me and he had a blast testing it out around our dining room! &#60;br /&#62; It's a great system - we think everyone will love it.
