 This potty is so small and easy to use on the go, making it an indespensable tool in potty training. It comes with a little carrying bag and folds up so small you can fit in in a small bag, a large purse, under a seat in the car, just about anywhere, so you can have it handy when kids need to go. This way kids being potty trained don't have to use large adult toilets in public restrooms if they aren't comfortable and they can use this anywhere, if there isn't a restroom nearby. The refill bags could get expensive so we just use generic plastic bags and they work fine too
