 True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5"-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor. My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes. My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one
