 My husband and I bought this gate to keep our precocious and exceptionally curious toddler out of the kitchen. (It took her about a week to figure out how to open all the safety locks on the cabinets.) When the gate arrived the box was heavily damaged and the gate was broken. We called customer service at Summer and they had a new gate and free return shipping label to us in three days! Installation was fairly easy for my husband who is not particularly handy with tools. We like the fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates. The only thing I don't like quite so much is that the latching mechanism is not terribly easy to use. You have to line up the gate and then pull slightly on the handle to seat the latch properly. Takes a little while to get used to. All-in-all we would definitely recommend this gate to others who have large openings to close off
