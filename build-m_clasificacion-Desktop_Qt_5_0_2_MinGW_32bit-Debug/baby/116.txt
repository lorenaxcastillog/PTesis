 We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas. She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself! This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty! The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections! It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy
