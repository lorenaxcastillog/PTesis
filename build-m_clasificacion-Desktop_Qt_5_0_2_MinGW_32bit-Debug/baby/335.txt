 I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant. I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work! I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in. I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on. I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction! I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on. I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me! I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it. A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare
