 This monitor was initially indispensable in caring for our twins. The default channel had too much static to use, but once we switched over to the 'B' setting, that stopped being a problem. I can hear everything through the monitor, even being able to distinguish between my two children breathing. I love the option to turn off the sound and see whether the babies are noisy - one of my girls HATED bedtime until she was a few months old, and this allowed us to let us see whether she was still crying after 5 minutes without having to go in the room or listen to the I-hate-bedtime screaming. After nine months of daily use, the receiver stopped working, but this is decent value for the price. I found that the Safety First monitor I bought picked up the sounds from this one's base, but with increased sensitivity. It would have been nice if the nightlight could be turned on without the monitor relaying sound, but the option to turn the nightlight off is fine
