 After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one. After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!) My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap. There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap. The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up. The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well. The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you
