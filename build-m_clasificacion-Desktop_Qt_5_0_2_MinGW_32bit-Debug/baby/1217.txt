 Have you ever tried to get your infant into a jacket, snowsuit or thick blanket and then into the carseat straps? Not so easy huh? Well this fabulous product saved me from that headache - although I tried just to see if it really was that difficult! I love that I can put my now 9 month old into the carseat with the bundle me and zip her up! Thats it! the front covers her face if it is windy and she is warm and cozy inside! On especially cold days or when she is dressed for cute rather than cold I put an extra blanket on her inside the bundle me and she cant throw it off! I have the lite version which I used all spring and summer (air conditioned car) and now this one for the fall and winter! Some have commented on how easy it is to move baby in the bundle me from carseat to stroller - I have to disagree I would just get a second one for the stroller. The velcro in the back that holds it into the carset will wake up a sleeping baby if you try to remove the whole thing with baby inside. A great product
