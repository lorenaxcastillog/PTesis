 I absolutely love and adore this tub. My baby didn't like baths initially until we bought this. He can sit back and slouch comfortably while I get him clean. He feels absolutely secure and safe and I am able to bathe him quickly and with no fuss. It is well designed and has a number of useful details. There is the plug which is heat-sensitive which will change color to let you know if the water is too hot for your baby, a spot to hold the soap and other bathing sundries and the tub itself fits perfectly onto most standard kitchen sinks. I like this last feature in particular because I or my husband don't have to crouch or lean over too much while bathing our baby. Bathtime is always a pleasure with this tub
