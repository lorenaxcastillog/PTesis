 This is an excellent product. It is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about SIDS. I felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib... and that she wouldn't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats. I was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton... and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material. We even had family members that thought that someone had made the CribShield for us.
