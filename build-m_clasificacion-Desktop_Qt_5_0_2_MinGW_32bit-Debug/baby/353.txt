 We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week. The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles
