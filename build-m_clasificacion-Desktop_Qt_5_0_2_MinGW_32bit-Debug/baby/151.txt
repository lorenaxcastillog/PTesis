 The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help. Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal. It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in. The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it. The worst part was getting her out. The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position. I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all. I'll be donating the swing
