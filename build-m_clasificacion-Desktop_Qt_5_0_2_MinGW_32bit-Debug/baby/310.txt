 I was very excited to finally recieve this stroller, but after I put it together (which was pretty simple), it was very heavy and bulky to handle. I was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon. I bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution. I was not able to load it in the back of mt SUV due to the size and weight, and it is very long and hard to steer. Anyone considering the Ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney. It does not accomodate my Evenflo carrier either, so I would have needed to also purchase the Graco carseat. I am returning the stroller to Amazon today
