 I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!!
