 We have twins and my son is growing a little faster then my daughter. When it became time for a booster seat we made a great choice. This seat is easy to adjust as he grows, easy to install and wrap the seatbelt through, sits firmly on contoured seats and is very easy to clean. I must admit that one of the features that helped me to decide on buying this seat was the interactive video that showed how it worked. I like this seat so much that I am now buying the same seat for my daughter. You will be very happy with this important purchase
