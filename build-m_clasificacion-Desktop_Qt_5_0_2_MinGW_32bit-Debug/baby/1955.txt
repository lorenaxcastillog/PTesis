 My son was a breast fed baby exclusively for 10months, then he cut teeth and decided that he wanted to bite. Well, that just wasn't gong to happen. He would take a sippy cup just fine for juices and such, and had been from about 5months, but when it came down to drinking milk, the sippy cup idea didn't seem to appeal to him, nor did the bottle. Then I got him one of the Avent Magic cups.....he loved it, and still, at 2years of age, it's the only cup that he will drink milk from. We never had a problem will spilling/leaking, infact, the only problem that I have is you can't find the Avent line locally where I live
