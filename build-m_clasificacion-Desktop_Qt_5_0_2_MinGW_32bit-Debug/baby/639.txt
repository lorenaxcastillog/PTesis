 I bought this for my twin girls and i love it. I had them in September and they fit it in all winter. It was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming. Using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle. Once you're in the car and warm enough, all you have to do is unzip the sides and there's no fuss
