 Shortly after I found out I was pregnant with our 2nd child, I bought a SwaddleMe on a whim. I knew the benefits of swaddling a newborn from having done so with our 1st child, and the SwaddleMe caught my attention with its design and overall ease of properly swaddling a baby. At that time, I didn't know exactly how handy this little blanket/wrap would be. Our baby is now 2½ weeks old and this product has become one of the most important baby items we own. Our daughter was fussy and just couldn't seem to settle down...until I pulled out the SwaddleMe and wrapped her up in it. The instant change in her personality was unreal. She's now a happy and content baby and the fussy crying has all but stopped. The only time she doesn't "wear" her SwaddleMe is during diaper and clothing changes and in her carseat - any other time of the day, she's snuggly wrapped up. Swaddling a baby with a regular blanket can be a bit tricky, but this specially-shaped wrap makes it super easy. The velcro tabs ensure that the baby can't accidentally loosen the wrap and unswaddle him or herself. I highly recommend this wonderful blanket/wrap to anyone who is expecting or has a newborn baby
