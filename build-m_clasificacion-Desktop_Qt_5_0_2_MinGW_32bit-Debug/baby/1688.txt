 I received the pump in style as a shower gift for my first child over 3 years ago (2003). Due to medical problems early on I had to exclusivly pump for child #1. The pump worked great. I used it several times a day and it was very effective and comfortable. I used it for about 3 months straight after she was born. I stopped using it not because it wore out, but because pumping several times a day for months was so much work that I couldn't keep doing it. My determination ran out before the pump's did! After that I packed it up and planned on using it again if I had another child. Child #2 was born early December 2007 and I was very pleased to find that my Medela pump was still in excellent working order. Child #2 was a professional breastfeeder from day 1 so I only used the pump when trying to boost my supply or to relieve pressure from engorgment when the baby wasn't hungry. I'd say I used it a few times a week for the first 2 months. After 2 months I had to go back to work and my Pump in Style came with me. I've been working for a few weeks now and I use the pump twice a day. It works as good today as it did 3 years ago. The quality has not gone down one bit. I plan on feeding child #2 exclusivly breastmilk as long as possible and I'm confident that my breastpump will allow me to do so. If you plan on going back to work and pumping, or if you plan on having multiple children then this is a great pump for the job. It LASTS. Its expensive, but better to spend the money upfront, get a pump that works great, is effective, comfortable, and will last you through the years than to throw money away on a cheaper model that you'll end up replacing. The pump is so great that I'm willing to bet that it'll last right through child #2 and if we decided to have another child, it will be ready to go again in a few more years.
