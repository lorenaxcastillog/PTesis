 I have a 2.5 year old and a 16 month old and this bag leaves my hands free to carry them or hold hands without having to constantly adjust a bag. It is the perfect size to take just what we need and not be bogged down by an inconvient bag. The very bottom pocket is very easy to get into without taking the bag off, it's a great place for your wallet and keys. If you need to carry sippy cups and not bottles make sure they are not too tall or they won't fit in the middle compartment (which is meant for bottles) The bottle attachment is good to store snacks if you don't need to carry a bottle
