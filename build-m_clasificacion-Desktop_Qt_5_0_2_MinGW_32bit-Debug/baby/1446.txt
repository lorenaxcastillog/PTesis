 I really like this stroller! It is super light, easy to manuver, folds up nicely, my girls love it..and the really love being next to each other! With my stadium stroller someone was either kicking the back or pulling hair..and fighting who is in back or front...the only thing I would say about it...it does just about make it through the door ways..it makes it but a tight squeeze. The canopy I can't figure out for the life of me ...but that is minor...cup holder is decent and at least it holds something. No storage bin but I hang everything from the handles...it's a good buy for the money and my kids love it and that is all that matters!
