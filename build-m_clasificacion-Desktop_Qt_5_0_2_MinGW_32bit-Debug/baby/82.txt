 This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born. I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice, I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life! I had the worst time with this bottle! It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast. SHe would also gag and had horrible gas! I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better. It ended up being the same problems again!! I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding! My daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula! Even though it is a little more work with the drop in system, I dont care! I can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less!
