 I was worried this looked cheap, and too sterile and hospital-like for my new baby, but it is much more attractive in person. Safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib, theirs looks dated. It arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble, by myself at 8 months pregnant! Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position. Click- Done! Has two adjustable height settings, and comes with a nice mattress. I would not order another one. This is very soft and suitable. This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly. The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft, love it! My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out. In fact I can't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives, since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs I saw in person at a local store. I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs, but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed. We bought one, but she doesn't want to stay in it at night. She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib. This crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib. This is a great product and very reasonable too!
