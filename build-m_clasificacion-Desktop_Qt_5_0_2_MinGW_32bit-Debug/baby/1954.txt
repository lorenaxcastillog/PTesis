 I have to agree with the other reviews. My daughter is 6 months and when the doctor gave the ok for juice I wanted her to start drinking it from a cup. I bought other cups and she would just cry for the bottle. I decided to by these AVENT cups because we also use this brand bottle and this is the only cup she will drink out of. We are still in the practice stage considering she is still young, but I don't have to fight with her at all. She is still getting good at holding the cup, but it is not a problem because when she drops the cup nothing spills!! I have even tried to see if she would drink from the other cups and she just screams until I give her the AVENT cup
