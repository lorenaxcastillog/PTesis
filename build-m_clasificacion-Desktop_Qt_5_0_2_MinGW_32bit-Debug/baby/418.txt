 We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own. Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys. However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem. I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location. I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem. For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience. We will be returning the item. Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance. I recommend you save your money on this one
