 I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I've actually done it. I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work, but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day... not hard. These diaper covers are fantastic. I have not had a single leak with them. When my daughter was first born, a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks, and we had numerous leaks. We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now. She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born. I use the chinese prefold diapers with them. I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold, but they're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated. What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don't have to hand wash them or anything
