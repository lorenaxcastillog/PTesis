 i love this simply designed, sturdy potty. my son loves it which is most important. he has no trouble sitting down on it; no pinching, no crampedness, no tipping over. the well sized arm rests help him up & down & the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over! having only 2 pieces & no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean. the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on & read books! great product, great price. i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother's.
