 I love this sling! I didn't bother to learn how to use it with my first child, but I am so glad I did with the second. It is wonderful. It was hard to learn because I didn't have anyone to teach me, but the website has video instructions, which are so easy to follow. I learned with a doll. I can nurse in it anywhere, and he almost always falls asleep as soon as he's in it. It helps me have hands free to play with my toddler. I think this will become a staple with me and my future babies.
