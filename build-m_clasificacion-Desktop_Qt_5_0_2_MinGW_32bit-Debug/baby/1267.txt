 In person this blanket is very cute and very soft and it perfectly matches all the other items in the Zanzibar line. The two giraffe design you see in the picture above is embroidered on the lower right hand corner of the blanket and other than the caramel colored ultrasuede hem around the edges, it is the only design. The dimentions of the blanket are not listed above but it is 29" by 39" and has a slight amount of stretch pulling it across the width but doesn't have any stretch pulling it across the length. This makes the blanket easy to use for swaddling an infant. It's made of 100% polyester but you'd never know it by the feel. It looks and feels just like the softest fluffy fleece yet when you wash the blanket it doesn't shrink. The care instructions are machine wash cold separately and tumble dry low. Do not iron or use bleach.
