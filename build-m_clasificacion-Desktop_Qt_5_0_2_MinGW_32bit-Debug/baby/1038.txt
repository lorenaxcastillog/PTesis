 We have been using these diapers with our daughter for from birth to currently 5 months old. They have never leaked the runny breastfed poop. Would get soaked if we didn't change her often enough, but she may be a supersoaker! They are very soft and stretchy, never leave red marks on her leg. Lots of snaps to fit all sized babies. They do take a while to dry. We wash ours, then do a cycle in the dryer and then hang to finish drying. Overall a great diaper. Would recommend to anyone wanting to try cloth diapers for the first time
