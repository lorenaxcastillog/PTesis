 This monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night. I test it frequently and it works. There has NEVER been a false alarm (everyone warned me I would lose my mind if it went off by accident, it hasn't). The only drawback, the channel is not so clear, there is static when you listen to it, but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny. (I have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when I just want to monitor noise during the day, but I would not have another monitor for his bedroom.
