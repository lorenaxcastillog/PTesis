 We bought this for my 3 month old son and he loves it. There are many nights that he has fallen asleep by watching the peek a boo leaves open and close. I think the level of volume is perfect. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little hesitant to order it, but remember- It is not supposed to stimulate your baby! It is to lul them to sleep! I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs. I would recommend this product-like I said I love it
