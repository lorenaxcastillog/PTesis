 My son was born July 04 and I usually keep my house very cold! I noticed that when I put him in the crib swaddled up in a blanket and came in minutes later to check on him, he had some how squirmed his way out of the blanket and was cold! Being my first child, I freaked! So we went on a trip to Babies R Us (because every mother (and you know what I'm talking about), will do anything just to go back to that store) and I found this item. I only bought one to try out and had to go back for at least 3 more. They are great!!! They have a light one for the summer and you can buy thicker one for the winter.. My son wore this at bed till he was at least 8 months old and he wore a long sleeve onsie underneath to keep his arms warm! You can't go wrong with this,,, I promise you!!!!! You will no longer have to worry about your baby getting out of their covers and getting cold
