 I have used this system for 9 weeks now. The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple. My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried. If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple. I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples. I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time. These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily
