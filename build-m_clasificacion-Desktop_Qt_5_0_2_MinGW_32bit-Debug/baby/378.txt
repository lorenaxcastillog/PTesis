 I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor, my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area; this way, I can pad him in and he's secure. However, I find it very difficult to manage. I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other! The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand! Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out. All of that being said, once baby is properly "installed", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles
