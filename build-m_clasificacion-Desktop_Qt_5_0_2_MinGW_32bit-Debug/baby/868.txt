 Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap. I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free. The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes. If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk. The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes. This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby. And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all
