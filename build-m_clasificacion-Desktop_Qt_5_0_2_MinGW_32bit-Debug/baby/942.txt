 I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't. It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any! I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom. The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests. The vapor bath is fantastic. We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion! I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice. We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be
