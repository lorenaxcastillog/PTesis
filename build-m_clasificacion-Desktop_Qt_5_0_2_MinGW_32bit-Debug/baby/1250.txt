 When trying to decide what we needed and didn't need for our daughter, I knew we needed something to contain diapers. We had no desire to trek out to the trash can at every change (especially those first weeks at all hours of the day and night!). Basically for me it came down to Diaper Genie or the Diaper Dekor. I considered the price of refills, reviews, and the advice of a friend who works in daycare and went with the Diaper Dekor. We love it!!! It has done a wonderful job and the refills have lasted longer than I would have ever imagined. The dekor came with one fill- and we've not gone through an entire box of refills yet. Our daughter is 7 months old now, she's eating solids and some of those diapers are pretty nasty. However, a quick change and drop into the Dekor and no more smell. Plus, it is just as easy to toss in wipes and other related trash items instead of wasting refills or tracking it through the house. The ONLY time we've ever had a smell-- is when we've had it open and the inner doors open to put in another diaper. As soon as it closes-- no more smell. Those who swear by their Diaper Genies-- I don't think it is an accident that the recent redesign of the DG basically resembles the DD in design and function. I personally think we'll get a lot more use out of the DD down the line. I highly recommend the Diaper Dekor for your nursery!!
