 I bought this for my 4 year old daugher. i liked the safety review for this seat. my daughter loves everything about it. I don't have one bad thing to say about this seat. i've had it for about 3 months and it looks like it did when i pulled it from the box. she has spilled everything you could think of on it and you can't tell. it even still smells new! the cushion is just as good as the first day she used it. i will buy another for my 18 month old daughter when she is big enough
