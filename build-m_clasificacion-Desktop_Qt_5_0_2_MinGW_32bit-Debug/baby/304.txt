 This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink. And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail. The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken
