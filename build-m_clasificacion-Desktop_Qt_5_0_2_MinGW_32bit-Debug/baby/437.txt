 I am returning my Roxy safe seat! It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door....The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat. At a grocery store, the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries. Its not worth the hastle. I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy. The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place. Sorry GRACO, the idea was good but the carseat is awfull
