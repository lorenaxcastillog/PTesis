 I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups.
