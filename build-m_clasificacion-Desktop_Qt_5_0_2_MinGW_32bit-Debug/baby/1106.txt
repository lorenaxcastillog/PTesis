 My mother in law gave us this boppy, and I am glad she did. It is easy to run out of new things to do with a young baby. So this is nice to pull out and put on the floor and let our little Tommy experience having a pillow under his chest. I also put him on his belly with nothing under it so that he can experiance that as well. This is interesting because of the bright colors and the toys attached . So far he isnt paying attention to the toys, but he is still only just learning to use his hands. So I am sure in the next couple months the toys will become more usefull. I like to place a brightlly colored book in front of him, he enjoys having something at his level to look at. He gets tired of laying on this pillow pretty fast, but our guy is supper picky and gets bored fast. Also it is small enough that it can be stored out of sight very easily. I think this makes a great addition to any collection
