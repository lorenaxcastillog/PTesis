 I bought this system when I returned to work 5 months ago. I only work out of the home for 10 hours a week. This system has been great for me. I have not have any problems with leaking. Just try to avoid overfilling the containers. As for the covers, I found having one of those grippy things helps to open it. For someone working out of the home 40 hours a week, this would take up too much room in the freezer. But if you are a Part-time worker or a SAHM wanting to have some on hand to get out of the house, then this is great
