 This car seat is magical. We had ot switch to this seat when our boy turned 4 months old - when he grew out of the infant seat carrier. He is so comfy in this seat that he never cries in the car and he easily falls asleep in it. Sometimes he falls asleep the instant he gets put into the seat! This is a baby boy that used to cry cry cry all the time in the car. I am so pleased with this purchase!
