 I absolutely love this storage system! After showing it to one of my girlfriends, she replaced everything she used for baby #1 with Playtex and used the Playtex system for baby #2. It is a very clean and simple system and minimizes the risk of contamination since you do not have to transfer milk from one storage device to another. It worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style; you use the same bag for pumping, storing and feeding. I have a deep-freeze chest freezer and used this for storage. I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to double bag for freezing. I never had any problems. If you want to see how much your baby is eating, with clean hands, simply lift the bag out of the ring and drop it directly into the bottle shell (the ring is heavy-duty enough that it lifts out easily). Remember, when you are breastfeeding baby directly from the breast, you don't see how much baby is getting. Dr. Sears says, "A baby who is getting a sufficient volume of milk will usually have at least 6-8 wet cloth diapers (4-6 disposable diapers) per day after the initial three days of start-up time. Enough wet diapers tell you that your baby is safe from dehydration." Everyone has different preferences, but I honestly can't see how anyone could be dissapointed with this storage kit. I only purchased two kits because most of the time, I fed directly from the breast, and eventually, dd wouldn't take a bottle, but for moms who plan to return to work, I would recommend more kits. I really only used my kits in the beginning when I was pumping a lot because I had so much milk
