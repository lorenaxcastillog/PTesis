 I love this item for a baby that is only going to take an occasional bottle so mommy and daddy can have a date, etc. I use mine a little differently. I put the liner (I use the cheaper soft bags) directly into the bottle. Then I screw on the collar and pump adaptor. I pump directly into the bottle then screw off the adaptor and screw on a lid (nipple ring with a plug in it). Then when the baby sitter goes to feed the baby, she does not have to take off the collar and risk loosing the bag of milk. She just screws off the top lid and screws on a nipple (using a contrasting color nipple ring with the plug for a lid may help distinguish which part should be unscrewed). (This also solves that problem of having the milk raised above the readings on the bottle.) Only thing I don't understand is why they don't give you more of the plugs that go in the lids. You wouldn't need the lids if they would just give you the plugs, you could put them in the rings that go with your bottles.... I know this is confusing; you kind of need to be looking at the pieces to understand what I'm talking about. For occasional bottling, 1 newborn gift set and 1 breastmilk storage kit is more than enough for what I need. My babies definately take to the nurser nipple easier, so that is how I ended up with this system. Everything washes in the dishwasher, so clean up is easy
