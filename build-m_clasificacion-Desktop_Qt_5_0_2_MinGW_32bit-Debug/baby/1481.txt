 This bed had easy to follow instructions which clearly state it is made for children under 50 pounds. It has stayed firmly together as we have read and followed the guidelines for proper assembly and use. My daughter is 2 and a half and weighs 32 pounds and we have had no problems with this bed! She loves it and so do about half her stuffed animals!!! I recommend buying this with the toy storage system she loves which makes it easy for her to pick up her room:
