 I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable. The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them. The shades come with two straps, one small and one large. My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big. The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head. In this position, her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it's not a big deal. If straight around her head, the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes. Even if adjusted as small as possible, the large strap is still a little too big. It should fit in another month I think.
