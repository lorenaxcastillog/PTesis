 My baby loved this car seat from the start. We've used it through all stages, including rear-facing, and now forward facing with my currently 19 month old toddler. The seat is easy to adjust as baby grows, and easy to install using the Latch system. The removable infant padding was perfect. Biggest bonus is the adjustable crotch strap with padded cover shield to prevent chafing and scratching between baby's legs. I'm due with my next baby in a month and have already added a second one of these to my baby registry. A wonderful car seat...you will not be disappointed. (Note that this seat is quite heavy, and best for permanent installation in a single car. I would not recommend it for repeated swithching to other cars because of it's weight.
