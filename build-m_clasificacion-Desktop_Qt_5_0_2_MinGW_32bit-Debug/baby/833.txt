 I havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated, but I guess I always check and make sure the lid is on right. The suction isnt too fast, which is great. My baby doesnt get choked. She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves. My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose. There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose. Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes. Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer. I still use the bottles, but I just have to make sure the whole time I'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath
