 I am very pleased with my purchase. I have a 3 year old and daycare a 1 year old and 3 year old so wanted something that I could walk with the baby in and let the older ones rest when needed. This works great! It isn't hard on the wrists like I found most double strollers to be. Can be easily steered. The only things "missing" are the cup holder which you can buy and I think that rubber wheels would have better suited the stroller especially for outside strolls. But other than that I am very pleased
