 After losing one daughter to SIDS, I now worry about everything. These blankets help ease my mind. I have never liked the idea of receiving blankets because a baby can easily move her hands and pull the blank over her head. The blankets provide warmth without the risk of going over her head. I usually put my daughter in her p.j.s and the in the blanket, but on really warm nights I just put her in this. Plus with it being a sack it allows her to move her feet around freely, which isn't the case when she wears feet p.j.s because with all her kicking her legs either get caught up in the croch area or the p.j.s get twisted around. Another benefit is that this is the only product to have the seal of approval from the National SIDS Alliance.
