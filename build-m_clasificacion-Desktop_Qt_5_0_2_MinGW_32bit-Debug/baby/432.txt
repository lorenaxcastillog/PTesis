 I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week. One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams. So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it. I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams. So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand. To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine. I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective. Good luck if you decide to order this
