 I originally bought this bag for a trip to Disney World. It held everything great, stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack. Although I was not using it to carry children's gear, I carried an umbrella, 3 bottles of water, granola bars, sun glasses, cellphone, keys, wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great! I am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag, it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far
