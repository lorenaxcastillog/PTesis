 This sleeper is awsome. My daughter is 4 weeks old and sleeps 7.5 hour stretches in it. I can pick her up and breast feed her and put her right back down, I think all the lack of moving around helps her get right back to sleep. She is right there with me al night and sleeps sooo soundly. Maybe it is the "4th trimester" feeling that helps her to be so calm. Whats great is that she sleeps the same way in it for day time naps without me there in bed with her. A must have!
