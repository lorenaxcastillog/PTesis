 My daughter is breastfed, but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one (with pumped milk and/or formula). We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers! Refused to drink from the bottle. Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles (not every day, but at least once per week). I tried a Dr. Browns and it was the same problem. And it didn't matter if it was breastmilk, forumula, warm, cold, room-temp, etc. She just screamed! during this time, she had been using a Platex ortho pacifier, but had begun using the soothie pacifer I got from the Hospital. She didn't like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with...took several months for her to like it. Anyway, I randomly had a freebie Soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that I thought I might as well try. she took it immediately!! I have since bought several more in preparation for daycare, and she still takes them with no problems (she's 4 months now). I have not had any problem with leaks, and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with Avent. My only problem, is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle. However, the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow, so as long as its kept upright it does okay. I have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the Soothie to feed.
