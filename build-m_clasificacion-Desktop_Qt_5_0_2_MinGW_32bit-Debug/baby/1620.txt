 The Gummie Rail Guard was a good investment. My daughters crib has larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn't fit. The gummie guards will fit any size. The only problem I found is that the tape which holds them on isn't tacky enough. Don't get me wrong... they work but my daughter found an edge and started lifting off of the crib. I had some left over and put the new piece on and she hasn't bothered with it. Maybe I didn't put it on correctly the first time? Gummie saved my daughter crib from her teeth
