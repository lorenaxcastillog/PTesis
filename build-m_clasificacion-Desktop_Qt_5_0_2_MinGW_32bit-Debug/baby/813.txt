 We have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it! The peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless. I used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly, and I do not miss that. I can cook dinner or watch a TV show in a relaxed state without worry. It has always worked well, and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately. The picture is clear, the sound is excellent. You do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in, but the cords are all generous in length. We would go nuts without it
