 I decided to purchase this stroller after testing our neighbors. Our street is full of parents with babies and on Sundays the street looks like a stroller racing track. That was great for me and my wife. We were able to see and test many strollers as they all seem to be on our street and in the area. I was lucky to push some other brands that are more expensive and I must say this stroller just felt better then the other strollers we tested. This stroller is fully loaded with all the features a parent and child could ask for. I especially like the individual lower recline feature. The stroller rolls with such ease and the rain cover being included is a great idea as they cost around [...] which takes the base price up on many other strollers. Our little guy's both a year old now (they are twins) have a great time in this stroller and seem to be very comfortable. I was thinking of purchasing a model with front swivel wheels but I just did not like the way the swivel wheel felt. I tested three different brands. The one I liked sold for more then [...] and compared to this stroller I just could not justify spending that kind of money. The other two front swivel wheeled strollers that I tested had a rattle feel to the front wheel area which I was so surprised about considering they both sold for more then [...]. I am not sure if that was because they were 12 inch wheels or if it was the designs. This stroller is one of those purchases I am very pleased about and it has held up perfectly for us over the last year
