 The idea of the stroller is great. However after purchasing and using it, it isn't well equipped. There is no cup holders, the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn't even big enough to hold a diaper bag, let alone any bags when shopping. I also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk. Need less to say I don't even use it much b/c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids. I wasted my money on this. Graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go Moms like me. Wish I would have waited. It is the same price. Wish I could have exchanged it.
