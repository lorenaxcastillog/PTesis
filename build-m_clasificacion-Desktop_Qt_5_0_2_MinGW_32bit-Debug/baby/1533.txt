 My wife and I are very happy with this highchair. The adjustable height works well, as well as the reclining positions for the back of the seat. It folds up to be relatively thin for storage, and the wheels are a nice touch. Unfortunately, the entire tray assembly, while great in its ability to chose how close or far it is from the baby, requires two hands to remove or adjust. Thankfully, the 5-point-harness will keep even the squirmiest of babies safely in place while you use those two hands to take care of the tray. It would have been nice to have a few more themed toys or gadgets. The tiger-teething-ring is nice (attaches to the tray so it won't fall on the floor), but most other Fisher-Price high chairs in this price range come with a LOT MORE for the baby to do. And that's our only hangup. Otherwise, this is a good value
