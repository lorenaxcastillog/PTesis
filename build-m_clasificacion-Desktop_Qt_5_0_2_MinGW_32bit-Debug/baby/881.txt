 My Wife and I bought this item for the usual reasons. We washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding. They're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them, if not a little softer. For the record, we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes. They went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting. Anyway, I'm just writing the review to offset the bad review. There was nothing wrong with the pads that we received, and they do what they're supposed to do-- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table
