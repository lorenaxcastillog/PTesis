 This is our second Boulevard model carseat and we love both of them. My only complaint is it's hard to get it centered/level in the back seat when it is rear facing (I have a 04 camry and my husband a 06 corolla). The tether wants to pull it to one side or the other. We also had to pull out the back support pillow in order to get the latches to click without cutting off the circulation in our daughter's legs. But the cover is very luxurious - more so than you can see from the picture. I was holding out for the Shannon cover but Britax kept pushing the release date back, and I needed to get a seat quickly as my daughter was outgrowing her infant seat. I was very, very happy when I saw how pretty the cover is. Other than the asthetics of the seat, it seems very solid and safe, and I am very comfortable knowing that it is keeping my daughter safe and secure when we are driving
