 We had the Britax Companion and it was very hard to use. We had even purchases extra bases. I was a pain to use. Our daughter sits in the middle of our car so we need something easy to use. The store that we bought it from said it had the same lining at Britax that they use in helmets for motercycles. Most infant carriers to not have this protectant. We like the snugride but they said it doesn't have the lining in it. So we bought this one plus an extra base. Let me said that it clicks in and out so easily. It has saved my back! Plus it doesn't wake up our daughter when she is sleeping too. It is a wonderful seat. I hope consumer reports gets a chance to review it this year. I bet it will be among the top seats. P.S. It also will fit with Baby Trend or Kolkraft Universal Strollers D
