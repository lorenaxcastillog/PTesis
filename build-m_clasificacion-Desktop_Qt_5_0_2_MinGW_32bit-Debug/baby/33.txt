 We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk
