 In my experience, using a bib without a pocket is pretty useless. My daughter always makes a big mess when eating and a pocket is mandatory. I love this one because it is soft enough to be comfortable and has a pocket that is actually firm enough and large enough to do what it needs to. I love that the entire thing is hard plastic, without any fabric--all you have to do is wipe and go. No staining or mildewing or anything like that. We have 2, one to use and one to spare and that's all we need. The mechanism for clasping is very easy to hook and unhook (for mom or dad), but is secure enough that your little one won't easily pull it off. It's also adjustable for little necks and bigger necks alike. We've used several types of pocketed bibs in the past, but now that we've found this one we will never need another kind. In my opinion, this is the perfect bib for messy little eaters
