 This is our second highchair. We owned the evenflow discovery highchair and found it to have many problems, so we were forced to buy a better product. This chair is worth the price. Our daughter is very tall, but at 23 months she still uses this highchair with no problems. PROS: Vinyl seat-makes for easy cleanup Safety harness is superior Extra tray is very convienent Folds up nicely and has locking wheels Seat moves up and down CONS: The release tabs for the tray are easy to break. If you don't properly push them in or out they will snap right off and your tray will no longer lock in place.
