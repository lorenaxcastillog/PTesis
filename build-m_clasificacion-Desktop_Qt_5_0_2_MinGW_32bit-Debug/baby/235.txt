 This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son. So since I got it and used it. My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged. It was one of the worst experiances. I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby. I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one. I am know expecting again and looking for a pump. I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again
