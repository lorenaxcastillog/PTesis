 I did a little research before buying this stool and I always came back to the baby bjorn. I decided to order it and give it a chance and I'm glad I did. It's small enough to fit in my bathroom and wide enough to hold my daughter on it comfortably. She loves to stand on it and brush her teeth all the time now. It's wide enough to move around on and not fall as well as it has a grip on the top surface for little feet. I'd highly recommend this product-Baby Bjorn knows what they're doing
