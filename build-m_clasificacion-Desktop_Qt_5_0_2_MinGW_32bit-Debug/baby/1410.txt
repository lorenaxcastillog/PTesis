 My son, he is in the picture above, received this as a Christmas gift from his aunt, picked out by me because it just has everything you need on a toy like this. The music and the sounds are not annoying to parents, at least not to me and my five month old, Jacob loves it. He is content in there for at least an hour, which gives me sometime to get some things done. He laughs when the frog croaks and when the bee buzzes and he actually hums when the music plays. It has learning mode on the raised toy bar or music mode which is great for younger babies like mine. I highly reccommend this item. Even though my son is to big for the playmat part I still use the mat to put on the floor when he is playing
