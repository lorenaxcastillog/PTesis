 No more nasty indentions in your seats. No more out of control chocolate milk spills. I purchased the StageSeat Saver for my brand new SUV mainly because my daughter eats like a caveman (no offense to any living neaderthals). She can now enjoy a beverage and snack without getting crumbs all over the floor and seat below her carseat. The Seat Saver does a wonderful job containing ALL spills and can be removed and cleaned very easily. It is made of a hard rubber material and does not move around once your child's carseat is securely fastened. It also has a lower flap that sits low enough so that your toddlers muddy shoes will not scuff up the front edges of your vehicle's seats. I recommend this for ALL car seats in your vehicle
