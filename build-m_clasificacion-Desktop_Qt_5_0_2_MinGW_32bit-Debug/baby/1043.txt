 I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL. HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT. WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY. I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE FAMILY, OR IN HIS ROOM. I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT. I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN, EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR. MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL. SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON'T STAY PUT. I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP, SLIDE, OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD. THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED. HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT!!! I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT! HE WAS HOOKED. I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE "I DID IT!!!! MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT." HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK. WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS. IT IS GREAT! EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW. IF MY SON WASN'T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL. THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD'S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE...MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE!!! THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNED ME WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS.
