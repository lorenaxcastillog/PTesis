 I bought this stroller, because I really hate using them, the packing/unpacking storage there of and such.(I prefer to carry my son in a Baby Bjorn, and a backpack when he gets bigger.) This stroller is light and folds down nicely. Even fits the trunk of my G35 Coupe, which barely classifies as a trunk. I use it for my son's Peg Perego carseat. It is not something you would take on the trail or jog with and doesn't have alot of storage; but for going for walks, using at the mall and such applications it does work well. HT
