 I don't have any stroller age kids, but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack. The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification, and it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom, but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle! After it broke I found the Valco, which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar. It seems a lot tuffer, and some closed handle mugs will fit. Best thing is I'll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas
