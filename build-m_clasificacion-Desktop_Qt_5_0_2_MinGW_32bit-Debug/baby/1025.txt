 This item was a must for our son who has had acid reflux from 6 weeks on...Yes, a baby will slide down eventually as they start to move and kick, but it was perfect for putting him down at night after nursing. By the time he would slide down, hours had passed and he was due for another feeding. Our son, 4 months old, 13.5 lbs. and 25 inches long, still uses it every night. Even if he eventually moves down, it doesn't matter. He LOVES the memory foam and it is so comfortable for him to sleep in. ALSO, our pediatrician took note because he was impresed with hiw it is so good for preventing flattening in the back of the head, It distributes the weight better. Great for a baby who hates tummy-time
