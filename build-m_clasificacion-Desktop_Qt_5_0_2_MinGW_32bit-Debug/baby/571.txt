 I wish I would have bought this bouncer when I first found it. My son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer. This one holds up to 40 pounds. I didn't buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me. So I tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute. Then I realized that if those people could get $35+; then I could too when I was done with it. So I finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds. He loves it. I love it. It's made very well. If I had bought it when I first found it I would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it. So don't hesitate. You won't be sorry.
