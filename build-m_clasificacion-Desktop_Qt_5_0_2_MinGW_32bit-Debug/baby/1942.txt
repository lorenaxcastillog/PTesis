 We already had a Britax car seat for my 3 year old daughter. I was hoping to move her up into a booster seat, but she was not ready to give up her car seat for her younger brother yet. That's how I decided to get a new car seat for my 10 month old son. And since I had good experience with my first one, I just stayed with the same brand and type. Both my children are tall and this car seat seems to accomodate that
