 At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems. But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby. Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway.
