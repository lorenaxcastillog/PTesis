 I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door. I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex. I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it. I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static. I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels. Note to self: keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!
