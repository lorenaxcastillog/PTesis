 I purchased this stroller a few weeks ago. I have a 22 month old & a 4 year old & they love it... My 4 year old loves the fact that if she gets tired she can sit or stand in the back. We are going to NY in a couple of weeks and this is why I purchased this stroller because you have to walk everywhere, now I am sure that they will be OK. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it's a little heavier than I expected. Other than that i's great! I higly recommend it. I plan to have another child so I know I will keep this for a while!
