 I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it
