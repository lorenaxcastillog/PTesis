 We could not have asked for a better high chair than this one. We have a small house and not a lot of room in the kitchen area so this is perfect for us. It attaches great to one of our kitchen table chairs. I love the fact that it reclines too. My son can hold his own bottle so I can recline him after he eats his food and then give him his bottle while I get things done. I totally recommend this high chair to everyone.
