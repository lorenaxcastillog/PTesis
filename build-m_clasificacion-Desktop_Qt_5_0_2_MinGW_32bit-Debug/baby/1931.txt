 This is the only thermometer we use at our house, my husband and I included. It is so easy. Just be sure to hold the top of the ear straight up then insert the probe, this should give you the right angle. As for the probe covers, you can use any generic cover. I bought a package of Walgreens brand covers and they work just as well. They are not the exact same and do look different, but looks and functionality are two separate things. Get over the cover issue and go to Walgreens or any drug store. Please don't let the other reviews scare you. This is a great product
