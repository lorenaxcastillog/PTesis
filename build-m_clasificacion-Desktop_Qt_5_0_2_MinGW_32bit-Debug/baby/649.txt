 I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way (boiling water in a pot on the stove) so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately. I loved that it was so effortless! PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage. No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child, so read the instructions. I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one. My only issue is that because of its small size (it has to fit in the microwave after all!!!!), you have to really stack the bottles, nipples, etc. in a way that utilizes all of the available space. Once again, the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack. So, if in your sleep deprived, hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache
