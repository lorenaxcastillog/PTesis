 I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. I will simply list the things I do not like: 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.
