 This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.
