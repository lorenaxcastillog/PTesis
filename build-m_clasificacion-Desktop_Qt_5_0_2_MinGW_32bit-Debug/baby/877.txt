 The crib just the way it comes is best. A thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons. Firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers. Bumber pads are also recommended against by *all* modern advice sites and classes. SIDS deaths appear to be related to suffocation, and this happens usually when the baby's mouth and nose are against padding. Firm mattress (like this very thin one) are much safer. The main thing is to always lay the infant on it's back to sleep, and not on it's belly. Also, never use a bumber padding in *any* crib for any very young child. Finally, there is also the issue of "outgassing" of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling. What you want, if you can't afford the very expensive natural options, is a *thin* mattress like this one, that won't have a lot of material to outgas, thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic VOCs. Best is to buy this a few weeks (or longer) ahead of time, and then air out the mattress. I'm even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point, so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle. This is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing, so that our new baby in January won't have much VOCs to breath.
