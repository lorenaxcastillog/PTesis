 Unlike many of the reviewers, I exclusively pump--that is, my son only gets breast milk, but I do not nurse him. I have the hospital grade Medela pump, which is fantastic--I get plenty of milk without nursing, and am even able to pump extra to store. I bought this pump because I've run into trouble a couple times when I was away from the house for longer than expected. My regular pump has to be plugged in (it does not run on batteries) so it's hard to carry around. I bought this pump because it is easy to throw into the diaper bag in case of 1) engorgement or 2) needing a bottle while I'm out. Although I'm not a fan of handpumping and have not used other manual pumps, I've found this one easy to use. Basically it works just like like the hospital grade--and I get just as much milk, just as quickly, with this pump! The design is so comfortable that I have even pumped while driving home one day when I got stuck in major rush-hour traffic. Being able to use it left-handed or right-handed is a huge plus. I give it only four stars because the silicon part on the handle has a tendency to get loose and I lose suction in the middle of pumping. Note for Avent bottle users: You can buy, for about $10.00, a set of adaptors (I bought mine at Buy Buy Baby) that allow you to attach the wide Avent bottles right to this or any of the other similarly styled Medela pumps
