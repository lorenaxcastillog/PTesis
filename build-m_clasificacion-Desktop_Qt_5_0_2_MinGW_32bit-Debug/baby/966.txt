 This is a nice chair, except for the brakes. They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot, they lock. It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock. Since we are constantly moving the chair to us, or back to the wall, etc., this is a real problem because you have to unlock them (esp. if more than one of the four is locked) in order to move the chair easily. As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler, this is even harder. The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of. If it weren't for the brakes, I would give it 5 stars. The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water, easier for little ones to push
