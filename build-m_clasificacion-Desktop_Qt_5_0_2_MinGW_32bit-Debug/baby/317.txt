 This product was terrible. First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats! Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt. The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it. The stroller is a piece of junk. When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match. Do not buy
