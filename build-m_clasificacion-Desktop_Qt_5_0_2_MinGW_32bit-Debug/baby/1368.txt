 I agree with the other posters -- this pillow's stuffing has not held up like I'd expect from a Boppy. It's almost as if someone besides Boppy made it and put the Boppy label on it; but the design is exactly what I've come to expect from Boppy: innovative and unbeliveably useful. I have been using this pillow since I was 6 months pregnant, and my baby is now almost 17 months old. I just can't give it up. My husband and I fight over it so much (he loves it, too, calls it the "comma pillow"), I'm considering getting him his own for Christmas! The shape provides so much back and bip support, even when you're not pregnant. I honestly don't think I would have gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn't been for this pillow, and the little tail (small end of the pillow) can provide amazing support for your lower back when you're nursing on your side (which means I was able to get sleep during those first few months of "sleepless" nights, also!) My pillow came with a washable case, so I toss that in the washer. The pillow did start to separate after a few months, but I've tried to keep it fluffed regularly; and I think that's helped it stay in one piece instead of separating fully into two sections. All in all, I highly recommend this pillow; but, as one other poster noted, it's a matter of personal taste -- and body shape -- as to whether it will become your favorite or be deemed a poor investment. I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and will likely buy another one when this one wear out -- even if I don't have another baby
