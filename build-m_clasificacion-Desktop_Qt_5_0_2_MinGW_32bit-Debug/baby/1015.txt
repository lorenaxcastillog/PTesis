 My son has been using this seat since he was able to sit unassisted. The chair is very easy to assemble and disassemble. It is also dishwasher safe, which is helpful for those really messy situations. The removable tray is great for getting the mess away from him, so I can clean him up without him getting messy again. He is now almost 20 months old, and we still use it (now as a booster). He is tall for his age, but it still fits him well (with plenty of room to grow). As for the complaints about it not fitting larger babies, I don't really know. My son is very slender, but there is quite of bit of "breathing room" for him. We make frequent trips to grandma's house and to friends' houses and this seat is very travel friendly. All in all, this is a great product at a great price.
