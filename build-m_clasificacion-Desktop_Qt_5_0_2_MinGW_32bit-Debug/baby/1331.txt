 Prior to buying this stroller I had the Joovy. It was heavy, awkward to fold, and had a very small basket underneath, and no parent tray. Even worse, the child tray did not move. This meant I had to squeeze my child in between the seat and the stroller, and adjusting her body and legs was very difficult. She was very uncomfortable and cried any time I put her in it. I bought this stroller and we all LOVE it. Here is why: 1. Easy opening child tray so child goes in and out of stroller easily 2. Large undercarriage basket 3. Parent tray, with 2 cup holders and a closed compartment, big enough for a few keys, money etc. 4. Good head/body room for the standing child 5. Weighs about the same as a one child stroller 6. Opens and folds with one hand Skip the Joovy, go for this one, you will be glad you did
