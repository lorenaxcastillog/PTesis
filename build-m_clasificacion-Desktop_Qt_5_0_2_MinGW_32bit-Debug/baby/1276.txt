 I've got an active fun loving baby boy. As most babies are, he goes through several changes of clothing frequently. I use this Tote bin as his laundry bin, and it works great! i keep it next to his crib, and just throw whatever needs washing into it, clothes, bedding, toys, whatever. After it is filled, it makes a good small/medium load for washing. It is attractive looking, stands up well on its own, has 2 cutout reinforced holes for easy toting, and contains the messes well. It also doubles as a toy/mess pickup bin, great to tote toys or other items in. The size is not too deep to reach into, for adults or babies. If you fill this tote w/ small toys, baby can play w/ it for quite a while, taking things out, putting things back in and looking at the mirror on the side. Since it is a soft bin, no need to worry that baby would bump little head on it. I think this is a better size/depth than the sea life pop up organizer. I exchanged the organizer for this, and love the convenience of it(the organizer has no handle to tote around, and is too deep to get to for people w/ bad backs or small children). I also have the matching toy box, which I also love very much. they look great together in my son's nursury, both are durable, easy to clean, and safe for baby to play with
