 I purchased the Baby Einstein Discover and Play center to keep at the office for days my then-5-mnth-old son, Toby, was with me at work. He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities. Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined. I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles. I can't say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons, but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months, when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short-lived.
