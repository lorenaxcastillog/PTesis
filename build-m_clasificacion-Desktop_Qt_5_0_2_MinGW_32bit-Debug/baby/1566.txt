 My son loves this bouncer and so do I. The bright-colored spiders slowly and slightly move up and down and are just the right size and colors to keep his attention and keep him busy "talking/singing" with them. The toy bar is perfectly positioned for the baby to kick and/or grab the toys and it is removable for easy in-and-out with the baby. The music is quite pleasant so I usually keep it running all the while it is keeping my baby busy. This bouncer definitely does me the favor of allowing me to get things done while keeping my baby happy. I highly recommend this product
