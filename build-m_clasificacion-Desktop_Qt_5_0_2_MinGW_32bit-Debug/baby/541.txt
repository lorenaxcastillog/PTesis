 We've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old; she's now 2 1/2 and we've never had any problems with it. This is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall, park, etc. The sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too. We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that. It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do. For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option. I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light "quick outing" stroller to keep in the car.
