 This product is great! my daughter (29 months) loved it at first glance. The duckies are cute and the size is perfect. It is a cushie seat that is secure and comfortable. She won't use any other toilet. I also have the first years' seat with the handles on the sides, but this one is far superior. The First Years one was about the same price, but the foam part is flimsy and separates easily from the base, and it does not stay put- once my daughter even fell in to the toilet water from shifting her weight around on it! This seat is a great value, and it also has a nice hook that you can put on the wall for quick switches from potty to adult toilet
