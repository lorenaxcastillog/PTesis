 We really like this gate. We have a very wide stair case and bought the extension to go with this gate. (make sure you get the right extension) IT IS AWESOME! My husband is really good with projects so we kind of made it better by putting a different latch then the one that was sent. We also put some longer screws so that it would w/o a doubt stay in the wall. It has been able to withstand our daughter pushing on it, hitting it w/her walker, and our doberman trying to get down our stairs. So, all in all, it is a wonderful gate for children & animals!
