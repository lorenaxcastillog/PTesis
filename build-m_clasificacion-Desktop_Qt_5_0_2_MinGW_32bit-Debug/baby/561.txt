 I bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and I am glad I did! I did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks I found were either MUCH more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features. My 7 month old daughter loves this backpack. In addition, we don't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets. I did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use. I originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but I can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well. I don't know how it would do for serious campers, but for every day use it has been GREAT.
