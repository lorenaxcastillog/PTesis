 It seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after I hit the purchase button. It arrived in great condition, too, and they even threw in a sippy cup! ;-) The fabric on this cover (the Ashley Floral) is very attractive. I love that it can be rear- or forward-facing. A friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car, and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she's getting this one, once her newborn is too big for her rear-facing-only seat. If only she'd bought this one, she said, she wouldn't have to go buy another. Haven't had my daughter in it yet, so update coming soon
