 it is a little costy but worth the money. it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways. since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness.a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight. once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover. its size is large enough to last many years.
