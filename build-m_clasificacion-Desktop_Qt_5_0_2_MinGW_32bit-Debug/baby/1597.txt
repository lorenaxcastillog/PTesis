 I have tried many bottles for my daughter. She originally used the nurser bottles for supplementation while I was breastfeeding(low supply). They told me to pump so I got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles to pump into so she could drink directly out of. She started having all kinds of stomach upset. We then tried the Dr. Browns bottles. They were good but she had trouble with the nipple. We switched to the wide neck Dr. Brown bottles, which she did better with, but still didn't like the nipple. Finally I got back out the playtex nursers. Upset stomach problem got better. She still has reflux, I think always will, but the gas is only occasional now. Don't waste your time or money with other bottles. Easier to clean too. You can't microwave these liners, but what I do is mix up a days worth of formula in a pitcher that I keep in the fridge and pour into the liner just before ready to feed, I then put the liner with the formula in a glass of hot tap water. It only takes a minute or two to warm up. Then drop the liner in the bottle and you're ready to feed. My favorite nurser bottles are ez feed with the slider to get the air out. They are sometimes hard to find but are really easy to use. One comes in the newborn set or you can purchase them individually at BabiesRUs or Publix Grocery store. If there were more than 5 stars these bottles would get a higher rating. Can't say enough good things about them. Also easy to travel with
