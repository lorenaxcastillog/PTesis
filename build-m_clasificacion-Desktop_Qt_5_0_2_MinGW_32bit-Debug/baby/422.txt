 I could go into a long explanation of how I searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself, who is a stay at home mom. I could explain in detail about everything I did to try and get this pump to work, in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working, of how I was freaking out my supply was dwindling so I went out to buy fenugreek.....But, suffice it to say, the motor lasted me 3 months of once, twice a week useage. It didn't completely die, which is why it took me a while to figure it out, but after paying attention, I could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when I couldn't even get a quarter ounce from one side and I was nearly engorged..!!! At least Medela is shipping me out a new motor, this one I hope will at least last longer. Especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months (6 month total warranty- which to me is too little for a product that costs over $100!!) Even though I'm staying at home and only use the pump occasionally, I wish I'd just spent the extra $150 and gotten a Pump in Style!
