 I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use. Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money. This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again. I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it! I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money! I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20! It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND! (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!) DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product!
