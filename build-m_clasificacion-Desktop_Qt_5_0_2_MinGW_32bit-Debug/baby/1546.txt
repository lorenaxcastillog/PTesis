 I love this jumper. I first used it at "Grandma's" house and I was amazed at how long it entertained my then 4month old for. So when I got home a week later, I ordered a different one from toys r us. It had all of the gizmos and gadgets and I just knew she would love it. But she couldn't even jump in it because of the placement of the leg holes in the seat. So I returned it and bought the Graco jumper like Grandma. The bumper around the seat is a must have. Along with the tray where we put toys and soon snacks. She was soo happy to jump again, she wouldn't let my take her out for 45 minutes!
