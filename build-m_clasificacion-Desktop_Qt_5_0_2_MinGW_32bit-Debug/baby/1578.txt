 I bought this product for the arrival of my second child. I bottle fed my first child as well. This product is a timesaver/lifesaver! I only wish I had it 4 years ago with my first child. The key is to read the directions carefully before using this product. If you use more than the recommended measurement of water for the warmer you will scald the bottle and formula and it won't cool down easily either. As long as you read the instructions and follow them, this product is a wonder and joy to use. The cooler is especially nice because it cuts down on the nighttime feeding process, but you must take special care not to chill bottles longer than the recommended 8 hrs. You'll love the convenience and peace of mind! If I only knew then what I know now... :
