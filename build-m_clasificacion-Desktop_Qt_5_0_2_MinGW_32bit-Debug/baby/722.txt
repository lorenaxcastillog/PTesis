 I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old. She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved. The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster. I think the Dakota booster works great. It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back. This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster. The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)
