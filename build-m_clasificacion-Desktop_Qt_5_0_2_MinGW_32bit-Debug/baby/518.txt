 I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair. The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months. I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting. The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean. The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink. I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others. My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table. I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort.
