 Initially, I was going to get a toy box for my 10 month old daughter. Then I decided she needed the extra space in her room to crawl around and I didn't want to worry about another piece of furniture she would bang in to. I saw this product in the store and bought it. Not only is it cheaper than a toy box, its a space saver, its portable, and its light so you can carry it and its contents from room to room, you can put alot of things into it. The baby loves the colorful design and I love the fact she won't get hurt if she bumps into it. Also, it zips up on top so you can seal it. I recommend it.
