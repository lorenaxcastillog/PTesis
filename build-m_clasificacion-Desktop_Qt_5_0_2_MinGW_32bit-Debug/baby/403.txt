 I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment! My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked. if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one
