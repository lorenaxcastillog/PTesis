 As a new mom I was looking for something that would hold my daughter's interest.My 1 month old daughter loves this mobile. We put it on her crib & she slept there the entire night without a fuss. The night light is just right to soothe & the sound level is perfect. During the day, I get my work done with her totally occupied with the bright colours & "jungle" sounds. Easy to assemble & great price...couldn't ask for better. My only problem with it, are the batteries..it eats them up, solved that problem by using recharables. All in all, one fantastic mobile.
