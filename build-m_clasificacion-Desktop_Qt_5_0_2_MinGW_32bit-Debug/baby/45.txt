 This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out
