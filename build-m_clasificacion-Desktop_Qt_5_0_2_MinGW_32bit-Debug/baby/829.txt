 Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier, my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut. It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport. Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back. I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts. The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably. For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product
