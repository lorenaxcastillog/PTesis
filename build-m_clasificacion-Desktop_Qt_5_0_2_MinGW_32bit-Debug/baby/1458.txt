 My husband and I recently purchased this stroller and I can't believe how smooth the ride is! We shopped around before we choose this one as our favorite. This stroller is so easy to maneuver around since it has the swivel front wheel, that's one of my favorite feature about it. Another feature I absolutely love is that the seats recline seperately and how easy it is to recline them. We have 2 kids (ages 1 &amp;amp; 2) and they don't have to turn around to look at eachother anymore. I have to say that anyone who has two little ones, this stroller is much easier to push than any other double stroller out there
