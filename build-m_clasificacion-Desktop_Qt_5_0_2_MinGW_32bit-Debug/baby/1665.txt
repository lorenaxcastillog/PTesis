 I have been researching strollers for months. I also considered the Combi, Aria twin, and Maclaren. I test drove the side by side strollers but they couldn't fit through tight store aisles. I liked the Combi and the Aria's width but they were awkward to steer and I didn't care for the storage in any of them. I agree with the above comments but the pros outweight the cons. It is heavy and it doesn't fold down as compactly as I would like but my son absolutely loves climbing in the front seat. I am 5'2" and I liked the handles and found it very easy to steer. I love the storage baskets and my infant seat fits great. I am happy with the Metropolitan fabric. It seems like I can wipe clean. I fit most of my grocerys in the basket underneath so I don't have to put both children in a "germy" shopping cart. Cup holders are nice too. Very easy to fold..easier than my single Graco stroller. 4 stars because it is heavy and a bit awkward to carry.
