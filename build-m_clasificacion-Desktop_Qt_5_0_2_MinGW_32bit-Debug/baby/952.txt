 Bored with all those "stage" in life books for your baby to be? Perhaps you are (as I am) soon to be expecting and realize that you won't have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may/may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives. Well then this book is for you! I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it (yes all 500 pages) on Saturday. What a delight. The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor. Be warned though, if you are looking for the "What to expect book" format this is not for you. This is a realistic, warm, and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way. If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up. Its like talking to an old friend that you haven't met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby
