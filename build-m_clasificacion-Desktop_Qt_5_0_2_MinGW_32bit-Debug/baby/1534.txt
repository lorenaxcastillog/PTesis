 I purchased this crib because of its price and the colour. I was nervous about buying without seeing a model one first. My husband put it together in a couple of hours with no major drama. My daughter has used it since she was 6 weeks old, she is now 14 months. I love it, it is sturdy and beautiful, the drawer underneath has valuable storage (we are in NYC), it was easy for me to lower as my daughter grew. I think it is practical that it can be converted into a bed
