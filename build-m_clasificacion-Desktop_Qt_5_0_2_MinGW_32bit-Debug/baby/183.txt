 Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off. With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis. I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier. With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway. I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple. Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products. By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway
