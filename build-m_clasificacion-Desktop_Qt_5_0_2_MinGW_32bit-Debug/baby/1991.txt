 We have a 2-yr-old climbing daughter, and when we vacation, this saves us! We use a crib tent on her home crib, and when we traveled without this playard tent, getting her to stay in the playard for sleep was a nightmare! Upon discovering the existence of the playard tent, I promptly ordered it (rush delivery!) so we could use it on our next trip. It worked like a charm. We had a little difficulty attaching it to the playard the first time, but every time thereafter has been pretty easy. It doesn't feel particularly durable, but it does the trick.....keeping her in the playard. Our daughter stays in the playard and we get some sleep when we're away from home. Without it, I'm afraid we'd spend every vacation exhausted. Highly recommended
