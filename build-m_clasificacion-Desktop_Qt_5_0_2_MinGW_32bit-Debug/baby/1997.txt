 My daughter had a combination yeasty/irritant diaper rash appear a little over a 4 months ago. The doctor prescribed several creams and the rash would disappear only to reappear within a day. I was losing my mind. I wound up making a special cream that my doctor had given me the recipe for. Unfortunately it didn't work and the battle of the diaper rash continued on. I tried all sorts of other creams (Weleda, Burt Bees, J&J, herbal salves...) and this all ended when I bought Boudreaux's Butt Paste! I put on one application and the rash was reduced to a slight pink area near the rectum. After the next application...Tada!! GONE! It has been 2.5 months ago and my daughter has not had a problem with diaper rash since. I have reccomended Boudreaux Butt Paste to all of my friends battling with diaper rash problems with their kids. They are all converted! Love the cream. As for the comment about not knowing the percentage of zinc oxide, it's right on the tube and in the information provided on the product page above. The cream contains 16%. Some children may have a reaction to the Peruvian Balsam. None of the babies that I know who are using this cream have. It's in the same family as vanilla and cinnamon and contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel. I suspect that if you are sensitive to these oils your child may be too. Just like any product, use your best judgment.
