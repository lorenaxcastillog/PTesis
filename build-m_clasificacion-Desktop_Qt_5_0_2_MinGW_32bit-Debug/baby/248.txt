 I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son. I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable. He usually cries when he is in it. He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted. It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way. And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling. Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.
