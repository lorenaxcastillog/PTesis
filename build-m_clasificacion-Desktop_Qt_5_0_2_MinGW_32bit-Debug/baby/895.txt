 We were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the Britax Marathon carseat on display had a Gogo Babyz Travelmate attached to it. It was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun. Two large, solid, screw-in knobs attach the Travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat. The whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use. We bought both the Marathon and Travelmate. We were looking for a better alternative to the Sit 'n Stroll. This may be it. I cannot compare the two options as I have never tried the Sit 'n Stroll, only read the so-so reviews.
