 I have a 2-year-old daughter and a little boy due in July, so I wanted to get something a bit more portable than my big Kate Spade bag. I've been looking for something like this for a while. The size is great- you can fit so many things in it- about 5 sz. 4 diapers and a wipe container, as well as snacks, toys, cell phone, wallet...the list goes on and on. However, I am on my 2nd one already- the quality of the bag is not the greatest. The cord that cinches the bottle holder broke within 2 days, and one of the zippers fell off. I just took the 2nd one on vacation, and though it was great for traveling, the bottle holder is already fraying along the top. I will keep this one, however...it is only $30, so I guess I could always get another one later down the road and not be too upset about it
