 I did a lot of research on everything I purchased for my sons room. I am a first time mom and was very hesitant to buy anything because of price I wanted quality on a budget. We really wanted a crib that had a drawer at the bottom for ALL of the blankets we had been given but could not find anything that we both like and was affordable. I LOVE this crib. We ordered it and was told it would be delivered in two weeks, we got it in 4 days. It was in excellent condition and took just over an hour to assemble the entire thing. It was so simple and looks great. I feel bad for those of you who had a bad experience but ours was great. I suggest any parent looking for a great looking crib at a great price to buy this one
