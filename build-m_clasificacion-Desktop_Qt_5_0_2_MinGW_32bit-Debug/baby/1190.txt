 I just received this warmer as a shower gift. I was hesitant to register for it in the beginning because of so many negative reviews. However, after trying it out, I've found that it is a pretty decent product. It's true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds, but really, how long does it take to wipe a baby off? The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes. I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes, which should be comforting to the baby. When I first used it, I didn't add the water as suggested in the manual, just to see how it would work. The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1/2 cup of water and haven't noticed any more drying. All of the wipes are still moist. I haven't noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes. My baby hasn't arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work. I think when he does get here in a couple of weeks, he will be thankful that I used a decently warm wipe instead of a cold one
