 This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself. Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper. We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it. I tried to put extra padding which worked ok, but still not great. 3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed. I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet. Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months
