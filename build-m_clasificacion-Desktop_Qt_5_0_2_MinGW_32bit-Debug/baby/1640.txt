 I got this as a gift when my second child was born and I absolutely lvoe it! My children are a year apart and are both very comfortable in it. The ride is magnigicent! We can hit a bump and the kids don't even notice it. It provides excellent sun protection from a wonderfully deep canapee. I would recomend this to anyone who needs a double stroller. Then only drawback, and it is small is tht it is not portable. It doesn't fit in the trunk of our car. But other then that it is a great stroller!
