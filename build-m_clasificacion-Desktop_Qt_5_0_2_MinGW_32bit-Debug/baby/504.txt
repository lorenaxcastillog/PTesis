 This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it.
