 My first child was a terrible sleeper and ended up spending most nights of her first year sleeping in bed with us. When my second was born I did not want to repeat the horrible year of sleepless nights. We got the co sleeper and have never slept better with a baby in our room! It was not hard to set up. I put it up by myself 2 days before I delivered without any problems. All you have to do is follow the directions. It was nice to have the baby so close to me for nursing, but not actually in the bed. Everyone slept better. As for the sheets, I went to the fabric store and bought a long piece of flannel and tucked it under. It stayed put and worked for the 7 months we used the co sleeper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a baby sleeping in their room
