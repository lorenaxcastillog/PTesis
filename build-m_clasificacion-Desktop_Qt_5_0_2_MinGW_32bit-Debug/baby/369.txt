 (2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for??? My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!
