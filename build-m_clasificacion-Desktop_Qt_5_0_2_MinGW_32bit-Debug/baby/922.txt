 AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS "TRAPPED", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY!
