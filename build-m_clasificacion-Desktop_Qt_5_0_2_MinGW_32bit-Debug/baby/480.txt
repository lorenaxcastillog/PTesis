 Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old. My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these! He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier. At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them. They have lasted through "both" children. I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them
