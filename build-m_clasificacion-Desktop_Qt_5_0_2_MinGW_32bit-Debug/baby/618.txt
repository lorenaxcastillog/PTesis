 My daughter is just learning how to self-feed and these placemats are great. I've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are. This product solves that problem. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off. However, I do NOT find this to be a major problem. Also, I tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table. Great tip. Thanks. This is a great product for kids learning to eat
