 We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived. We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive. We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee. Don't buy it. The guarantee or the pail! It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it. We have kept it in the garage, and also outside. Not convenient. Refills are expensive. And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing???
