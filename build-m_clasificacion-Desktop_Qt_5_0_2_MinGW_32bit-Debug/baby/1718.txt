 After looking at nearly every booster seat on the market, I decided to get this one, and I'm glad I did. My 4 yr old daughter loves this seat. The other booster seats are hard plastic and hurt her rear. This is the only one that I found that had a cushion and seemed easy to clean, and it is easy to clean. I like that it came in black too, as my table is black, so it doesn't stand out or look ugly. I also like that it came with a carry bag so I can bring it with us to the movies or plays that we attend and I don't have to worry about her being uncomfortable during them anymore. Great product!!
