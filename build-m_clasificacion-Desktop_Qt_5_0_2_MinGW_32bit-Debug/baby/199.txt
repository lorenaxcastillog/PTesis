 We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes... that is... until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom. Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day. It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom. Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model, but after searching online, I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had, and now have decided to buy a different brand. I did keep the water filled, and still had a poor experience. Save your money and invest in a different brand
