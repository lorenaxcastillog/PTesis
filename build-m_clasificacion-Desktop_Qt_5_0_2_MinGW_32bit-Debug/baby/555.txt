 Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust. For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage. Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces). If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles). I absolutely love this product & would never consider another bottle
