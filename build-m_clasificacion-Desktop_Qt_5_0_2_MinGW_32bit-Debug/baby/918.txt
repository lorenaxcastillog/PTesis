 I got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter. I was concerned that it would be too large for my car (I have a Honda Civic), but it fit just fine. Rear-facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat, so if you have 2 kids, you would have to put the seats up further, but if you are short, that will likely not be an issue. I had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly -- he installed it in minutes and did NOT need any foam pieces to make it fit properly! It was a perfect fit on its own. Pros: 1. it is the best car seat you can get! 2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep 3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats 4. the seat is very well cushioned, soft fabric 5. fits fine a small car even rear facing (I have a Civic) 6. it's heavy so its not going anywhere! 7. works for up to 65 pounds, so we will get a lot of use out of the seat 8. she loves it! Cons: 1. it is large/heavy (though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem) 2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child, but you need to pull straight out and not up 3. it is expensive I highly recommend this seat (we have the Onyx fabric). It is large, heavy and expensive, but it is the best!! I had buyer's remorse for a few minutes, but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter. I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat! Very pleased with this seat! Also, please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician (Check with your local Children's Hospital). Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants. Something very easy to prevent
