 This stroller completely serves its purpose. My little girl is almost 3 and 31Lbs, I think this one is perfect for the little one who still needs a place to be when your out and about, we tried umbrella strollers (too small) and searched for too long for the perfect one, then I found it here on amazon at the best price (and I did look everywhere), I read complaints about the handles being to low and it made it uncomfortable to push, well not for me, I am 5'6 and it was just fine for me and my husband is 5'8 and we had no problems. The only drawback is the storage under it, but it is such a small price to pay, you can still put stuff there but not as much as a full size stroller. I would recommend this stroller to anyone I could who will need a transitional one, size and all
