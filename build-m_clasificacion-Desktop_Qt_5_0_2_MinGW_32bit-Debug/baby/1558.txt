 This potty is perfect for keeping in the trunk of the car for emergencies on the go. The lid closes, so it fits into the trunk with no problem, and you can throw a package of wipes into it to have handy. Put a 2.5 gallon Hefty zip-close bag over the removable pot so the child can urinate right into the bag, then you can zip up the bag and toss it. Easy and clean!! There is also room to fold up 5 or 6 more bags and store them under the cover. I never go ANYWHERE without this potty for my son! The pee guard does fall off easily, but you don't really need it and I threw it away once my son could aim downward into the bowl
