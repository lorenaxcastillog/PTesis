 Not sure why this got bad reviews. There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak. But once we figured that out we had no problems. We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem. Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe. Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value
