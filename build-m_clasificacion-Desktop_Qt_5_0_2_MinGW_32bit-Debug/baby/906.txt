 My son was 20 lbs at 6 mos., so we had to stop using front carriers :( I bought the Combi as well as this one and this one is much more user friendly (SO easy to get on and off by yourself) and much more comfortable. I've read reviewers saying it's uncomfortable...well if you have a big baby...it's just going to be uncomfortable! They're heavy! But this is the best one & it's nice to give your arms a break! The neck strap is well padded and easy to switch from one side to the other (for relief) w/o taking the baby out. It's compact enough to keep with you. And if you're baby just needs to be close to you or held sometimes...it's a MUST HAVE! We took a trip last week and it was PRICELESS! One tip: read the instruction manual and you will enjoy this product a ton more
