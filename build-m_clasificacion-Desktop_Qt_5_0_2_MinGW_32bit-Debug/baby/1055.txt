 We got this item as a gift and even before opening the package, I thought "FINALLY!!!". We've had a few leaks on long raod trips and the PiddlePad is fantastic. Now it's just one little easily washable insert to throw in the wash, instead of trying to wrestle apart the car seat to take the cover off to wash it. And then you have to try and get it all back together again. Ever seen a second-hand car seat at a consignment store or garage sale??? Now you know why they're so filthy! No one bothers to pull them apart to clen them. We can't rave enough about the PiddlePad!
