 My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born. He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time. Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds. It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone. The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!! I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!! I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this!
