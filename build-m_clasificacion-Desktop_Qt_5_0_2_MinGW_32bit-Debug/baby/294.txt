 Unless your baby has very long legs, they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water. My son is 1 and cannot reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat. However, he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when I am trying to buckle him into his seat. Also, I have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it, and I am not finding a way to put new water into it. The floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated - and it's kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat
