 this spoon is the only one that keeps my little one from getting frustrated and losing interest when self feeding. the food actually stays on the spoon long enough for him to place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down and him getting upset because of it. plus the curve of the spoon provides just the right angle for him to hold it and enter his mouth as he turns his wrist. other spoons which have a straight handle cannot do the job. it takes too long to reach their mouths and food falls right out. hooray for sassy once again! other manufacturers should follow their example on this one
