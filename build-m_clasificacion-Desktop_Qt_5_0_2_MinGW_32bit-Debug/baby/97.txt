 My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth. We don't really like it. Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe. That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change! (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full. But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half. We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child. It wore out around the time we started potty training her. That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one
