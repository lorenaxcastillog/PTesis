 I thought the monitor worked really well. I picked this one out because I loved the glow light feature. It is so much better to use the low light during nighttime feedings....but the light bulb in the receiver is not replaceable :( I have only used it for 6months and it burned out on me already. It goes off after 15 minutes and the directions say it is long lasting. Well, not long enough and I am contacting the comopany for the warranty. hopefully they will fix it
