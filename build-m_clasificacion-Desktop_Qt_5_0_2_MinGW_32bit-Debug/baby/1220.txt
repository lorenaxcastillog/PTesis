 I originally bought these bottles b/c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w/ this starter kit. I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer. My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle. I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her. I always found myself buying a few more of these. I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error. I also use these for storage from time to time w/ the addition of a sealing disc. It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack
