 I've been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and I think I've found it! We've been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born, but he has clearly outgrown it. I tried one of those seat tubs(?), but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs ... TERRIBLE tub. Thankfully I was able to return that one. I found this one here on Amazon and reluctantly purchased it. Glad I did!! It allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play (now that he can sit up unsupported). Bath time has become much more fun ... for both mom & baby! UPDATE : i first reviewed this after we purchased the item. I've been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn. I don't think i've used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than "expected". Unfortunately, the patch-kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely. Very unfortunate because we loved the tub. New rating : 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore
