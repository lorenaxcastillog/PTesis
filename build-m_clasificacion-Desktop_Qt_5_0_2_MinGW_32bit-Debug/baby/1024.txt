 I love this bath "tub." We have been using it from the time our baby was just one week old for sponge baths. He is now 2 months old, and he loves bath time! This product is great. It is very soft, and it seems comfortable. I wish I had one for my baths! Our baby loves bath time. The pillow stays warm with the bath water. Just be sure to hang it to dry after bath time to avoid a chilly pillow at the next bath. It dries quickly and is easy to care for. Love it!
