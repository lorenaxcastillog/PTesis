 Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, "unacceptable" because it's unsafe. (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.) Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay. Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should. CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling. Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store. Be sure to avoid model 14565
