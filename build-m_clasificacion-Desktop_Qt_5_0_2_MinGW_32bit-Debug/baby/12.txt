 I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere. Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy! So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!
