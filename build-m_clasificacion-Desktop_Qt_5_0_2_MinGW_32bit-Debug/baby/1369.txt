 I got this pillow when I was about 5 months pregnant because I was needing something between my legs for my hips. I am now 39 weeks pregnant and I can't imagine sleeping without it. It makes rolling over easy and it stays between your legs so there is no need to adjust when you roll over. The part that goes under the belly provides just the right amount of support and isn't too big and bulky. I will even be taking this with me to the hospital for while laboring! I love the boppy prego pillow
