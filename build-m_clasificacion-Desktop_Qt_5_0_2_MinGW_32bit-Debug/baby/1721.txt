 This sleepsack is perfect. I was a little skeptical, and didn't know whether to buy the cotton one or this one. I am very happy with the quilted one. It is a fairly light cotton fabric, with quilting stitched into it. It is extremely soft and seems to be of awesome quality. After washing, it holds up wonderfully. My daughter has not arrived yet, but is expected to any day now. I feel good about putting her to sleep in this blanket to help keep the SIDS epidemic down.
