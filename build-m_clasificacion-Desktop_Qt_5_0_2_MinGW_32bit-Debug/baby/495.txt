 We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area. We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate. The elongate was to cover an area of 84". The elongate can only go straight across and opening. It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across. We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates. Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall. Took us over an hour. The Configure gate is on the pricey side. We almost did not buy it. But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need. We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs. It was so easy to add the extension piece on. You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece. You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening. To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on. It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes. It was very sturdy. I highly recommend this gate.
