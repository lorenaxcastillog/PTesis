 These bags are GREAT! My son had an extended NICU stay so I pump exclusively and have to be very careful with hygiene. With these I can quickly and easily sterilize my pump attachments, his bottles, his pacifiers or even a couple of his toys. All I do is add some water, microwave, drain and done. No boiling water, no timing, no accidentally melting things on the bottom of the pot, no hassle with complicated electronic sterilzers, and almost no storage space! Each bag is good for around 20 uses then you toss it out and get a new one, so a package of them lasts quite a while. Very handy when traveling too, since many hotels and gas stations have microwaves so you can sterilize what you need to on the go without trying to haul a bunch of junk around with you
