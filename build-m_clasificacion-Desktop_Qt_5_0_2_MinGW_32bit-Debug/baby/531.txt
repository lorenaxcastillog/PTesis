 I ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects. This seat is perfect! My almost 2.5 year old daughter took to it immediately. It's not too small (she's very tall) but not too big (she has a petite bottom). It cleans up easily, and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her. The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet, and has handles for the child to steady him/herself. The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning. There are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it. The lid closes "just like mommy's potty" and becomes a wide flat step stool. Perfect product
