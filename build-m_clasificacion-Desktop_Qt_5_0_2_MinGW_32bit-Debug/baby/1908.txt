 I purchased the two panel extension kit for the Summer Secure Surround gate system which attached easily and has made a great idea even better. My granddaughter has more than enough room to play and not feel as though she is being caged in. This summer it will be easy to bring her outside to play and not worry and watch every second we are out there. The system is tall enough to be useable for years and when the good weather comes we can think about the other attachments (shade umbrella, etc.) available.
