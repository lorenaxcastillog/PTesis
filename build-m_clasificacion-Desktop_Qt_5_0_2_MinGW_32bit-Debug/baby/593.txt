 The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market! It's easy to operate and stays odor-free! To get rid of a dirty diaper, just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail. Completely hands-free! You don't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie. When the pail is full, just pull out the bag, cut it loose on the door-mounted blade, and tie a knot in the top. Then, just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers! The "continuous liner" concept is genius! I've been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter's birth ... and I'm still on the same refill that came with the pail. I did, however, stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry! :-
