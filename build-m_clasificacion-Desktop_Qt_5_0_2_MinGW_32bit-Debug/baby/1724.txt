 I just bought this changing pad cover for my baby who is expected this summer, and one of the things I was a little concerned about was if it would fit my existing changing pad that my son used. We have the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad, which seems to be a popular pad for people to use, and I was happy to find that it fits very nicely. The fabric does seem a little thin, but I will not know how well it will hold up, however, until the baby comes. Pottery Barn Kids also sells really soft chamois covers in a variety of colors for $19 a piece, and I have one of those for my new baby, too. The Pottery Barn one is a bit thicker. Once I test them both out I'll be sure to update this post and let you know what I think
