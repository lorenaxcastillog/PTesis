 I really like this warmer. Its small and it works fast. There is a little water holder that attaches to the side of the unit to keep the water ready for when you need it. Just add the water, put in the bottle and wait 2-3 minutes. The only problem I have with the warmer is that I use water for the bottle that is room tempature so if I leave the bottle in the entire warming time it gets too hot for my baby to drink. So I just take it out after 1 minute, check it on my wrist and it is usually ready. If you are taking a cold bottle from the refridgerator and warming it, you can leave it for the full warming time of 2 - 3 minutes. I highly recommend this warmer
