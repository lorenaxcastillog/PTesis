 I love this product. I've been EP-ing for my preemie for 6+ months now and have kept my sanity because of this product. I've tried other hands free methods like using my nursing bra flap to keep it in place (doesn't work for me) and the Easy Expressions Bustier which a lot of people love, but I didn't because it compressed my rib cage and made my back ache. Not a pleasant experience. You do need a Medela nursing bra, but I love their bras too
