 We have several toilets so I bought other potty seats intially so I didn't have to carry up and down stairs. The handles are a must for the user to get on and for the cleaner to take the seat out without touching icky stuff. The boy cup in this one is not removable by the user. On one other model I had, the cup didn't last a day. This ring is by far the most stable. As for the reviews about it being unstable, I wonder if the foam supports were put on. In addition, your child is supposed to be supervised in the bathroom! Good grief! They shouldn't be leaning over for anything... hand them the book! And chafing? How long is the kid sitting there? Overall and excellent seat. I ended up replacing all the potty seats in the house with this model.
