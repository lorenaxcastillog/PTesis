 I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive. Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for. Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in. I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk! I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie. I hope this will work out much better
