 This Soothing Motions Glider is the best thing I have ever bought for my Child Day Care Business. I say anyone with an infant would enjoy this. It is easy to take apart and clean, it is quiet, it is wonderful! I can't say how long you will be able to use it...I have one very large 9 month old that is too big for it, and I have a 2 month old and a 6 month old who love it. The mobile above it is easy for them to reach, the music is soothing. I just works great. I wish I had one when my children were young
