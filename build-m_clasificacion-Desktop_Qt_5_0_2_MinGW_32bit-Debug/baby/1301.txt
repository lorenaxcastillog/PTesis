 I bought this carrier shortly before I flew with my baby for the first time. We have a Peg car seat, and I didn't want to schlepp my Peg stroller through the airport, etc. while on vacation. To my surprise, I find that I use my Combi Flash much more often than my Peg stroller. It's very lightweight, is very easy to pop open, and has held up well through various trips. I also like that it has a handlebar that goes all the way across, because it is much easier to steer (especially one-handed). My husband also had a tricky time removing the plastic parts that you have to pull off in order to make this work with the Peg; once they were off, though, the stroller has been a breeze. I would give one word of warning: you do have to be careful with this stroller that it is (1) popped all the way open (there's an audible clicking noise when this happens) and (2) that the car seat carrier is strapped in. The Peg carseat sort of just rests on top of the carrier, which makes it a bit susceptible to tipping over on uneven surfaces.
