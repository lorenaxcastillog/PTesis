 OKAY, FOR STARTERS, I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE. IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD. UNTIL...I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT (AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS.) WHERE TO BEGIN, THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS. WHICH MEAN, IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS! I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE. SECOND, I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION (24", THE ONLY ONE THERE IS) BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1/2 INCHES. THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION. IT DOESNT. I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION. IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK, I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE. UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS, THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT. NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE. DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH.
