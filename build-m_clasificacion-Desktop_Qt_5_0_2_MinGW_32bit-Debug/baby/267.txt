 I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima. Big difference. The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks. It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you. Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off. If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast. If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough. I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead. The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert ("blue" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there. And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags. I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other. I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options. :(
