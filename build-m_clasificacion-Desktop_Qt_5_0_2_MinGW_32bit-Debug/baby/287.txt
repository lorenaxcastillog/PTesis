 I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.
