 So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn't stick to the wall. At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower, but oh no that's not it at all. Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon. But yet again, the darn thing came un-stuck. So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn't register for, investigate whether or not it's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return. Literally.
