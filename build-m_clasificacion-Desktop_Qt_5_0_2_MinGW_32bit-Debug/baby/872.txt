 I bought this same crib in May of 2005 from Buy Buy Baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble I did it while I was pregnant. It had no scartches or chips. I like it a lot and my daughter loves it. we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2. But its very roomy. It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much. I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we're very very happy with. In fact we bought another one from amazon, for my son. My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1. He likes it a lot too. But even though company and everything is the same. the crib did come with some damaging to it, but it wasnt that bad, you dont really notice it, we got lucky i guess. But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off. The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought. I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues. But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one. But its definately worth the buy. AND it came with SUPER FAST SHIPPING with amazon. and the shipping was free too. But its well worth the buy!!!!!! My kids are happy and so im happy!!
