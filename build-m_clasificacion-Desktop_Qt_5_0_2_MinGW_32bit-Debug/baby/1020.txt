 I bought the Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone not only because of the price but the fact that it is not as big and round as others. It is perfect for our apartment with not-a-lot of space. My 6 month old loves it, she bounces in it and chews on all the toys. She loves to spin the ball around, she moves the see-saw animals up and down as it makes a wonderful clicky noise she gets a kick out of (not loud). The bar going across is pretty close to her head but she doesn't hit her head on it. She chews on the zebra connected to the mirror and spins the caterpillar heads around.. it's really very nice, while not being so busy and bulky when unneccesary like others
