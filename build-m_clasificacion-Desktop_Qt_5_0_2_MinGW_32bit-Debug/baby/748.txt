 We heat our home with a coal stove, so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold. With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room. The humidity level comes in handy during cold season, I've found. The night light on this monitor is great, it's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether. I've not owned it very long, so I can't comment on durability yet, but so far so good. My [..] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it's still fine. I would definitely recommend this monitor, thank God the price was right too
