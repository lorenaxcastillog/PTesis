 I ordered this pack after my friend's baby shower, she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was. It fit both her and her husband very well, so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in. WE love it. It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great. Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it, it has made our walks more enjoyable, I have free hands to hold our dogs' leashes and she likes being up to see everything. I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack, but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars. Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get, I cannot wait to go on a day hike. I had been pricing other packs and they were close to $200, this was$90 w/ free shipping, a huge price break, plus I got it in about 3 days, thanks Amazon
