 I bought this for my Chicco London stroller and it works like a charm. Had to play around with the perfect location for the connectors -for Mommy's cupholder (or water bottle holder) and for baby's snack holder - but once I had it attached, we both couldn't be happier! I wish that they sold the snack holder separately - I keep forgetting to take it off, and after 2 years, it is showing signs of stress at the clip. Won't be long before it snaps, but it really gets bounced around in the back of the minivan, so I think it has held up great. Anything to keep my tot happy
