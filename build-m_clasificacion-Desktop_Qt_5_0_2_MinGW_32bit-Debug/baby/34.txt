 I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor. The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks. Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover "material failure". I will not buy anything else from this company. Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous
