 I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems. Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months. When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me. But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20. It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience
