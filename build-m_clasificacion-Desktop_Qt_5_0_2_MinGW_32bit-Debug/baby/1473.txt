 I have two of these dishwasher baskets, but I do not have the valve basket. They can be purchased separately at some stores. I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top, but it much more difficult to use. Everytime you opened it to add another nipple, the ones already in there would fall out. These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better. They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into. The best aspect, however, is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened
