 I was able to breastfeed my son until he was eleven months old, while working full time by using this pump. I used it with the One-Step Storage system, which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work. The cups were super-comfortable, and after some practice, I had no trouble getting letdown. I could usually pump 4-6 oz per 15-20 minute session. I haven't noticed that it is any noiser than my friend's Medela. I haven't tried other electric pump, however, I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it. This one was perfect for me
