 I have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker. We started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly, active baby he is, he loved being able to push himself around. Now, along with his "walking", he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights. Along with that, he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while "chatting" with them. This is a great walker; just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times! I highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own. It also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch-up-with-to-do-list time!!
