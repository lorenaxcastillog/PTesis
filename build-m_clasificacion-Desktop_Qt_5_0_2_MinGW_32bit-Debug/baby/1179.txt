 My son is now 3 months old and has had a rough go with acid reflux. He loves to be held and especially upright. He hated my Snuggli (like the baby Bjorn)and I needed my hands free with two older children. It is so comfortable and doesn't hurt my back and shoulders the way the front carrier did. I get comments on everywhere I go. They all want to know where I got it and thought it was quite a fashion statement. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this wrap. I was intimidated before I ordered it wondering if I would be able to figure it out. The instructional DVD is so easy to follow. I only had to watch it twice through and haven't given it another look
