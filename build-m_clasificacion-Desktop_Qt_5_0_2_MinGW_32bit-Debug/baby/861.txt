 Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it
