 I had originally tried another type of shopping cart cover which was difficult to use. A friend of mine was using the Buggy Bagg and I was impressed that she was able to install it in the cart with one hand while holding her baby in the other. I liked that the Buggy Bagg *completely* covered anywhere the baby might touch. It comes with a pillow but frankly the padded back and seat were so comfortable that I never needed to use the it. (You may find the pillow more useful with a younger baby that isn't sitting up steadily yet.) I've also used it to cover a restaurant high chair - the fit is very tight and a bit lopsided, but if you have a small baby it works out great! The large pockets on the back are also a great feature. I keep wipes, diapers and diaper cream in the large pocket all the time, and the smaller pockets come in handy while I'm shopping for my sunglasses and coupons.
