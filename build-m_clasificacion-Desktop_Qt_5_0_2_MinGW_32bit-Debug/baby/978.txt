 My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie. My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep. I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile. I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases. But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it. So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth
