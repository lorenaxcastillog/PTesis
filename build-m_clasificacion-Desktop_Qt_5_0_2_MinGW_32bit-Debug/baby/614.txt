 The gate works perfectly. However, it doesn't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive. I am very handy with tools, remodeling, etc. and I found the installation to take longer than I would have expected. The latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top. There was a "U" stamped in it, but no mention of that in the instructions. Nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom. How hard would that be? One sentence? I went through a dry run and figured it all out, but it doubled the installation time (took +/- 1 hour)
