 Diaper Genie Stage 2 Refills have helped us eliminate odors in our twins room. Easy to install and discard. Our one year old twins use a lot of diapers and they have been eating solid foods for 6 months. But you have to install them tightly on the Diaper Genie. If the refill wabbles on its place, then you need to see what's wrong before starting using it. Otherwise the odors will come out. The real fact is that it works!!. And you know, its great to be at home with my twins in their room and have everything tidy. We used to throw the diapers in the bathroom garbage can, but after a few hours we couldn't stand going in there. Note: I am the father, and just spend a couple of hours a day with them... My wife could tell you more on how she loves this diaper genie
