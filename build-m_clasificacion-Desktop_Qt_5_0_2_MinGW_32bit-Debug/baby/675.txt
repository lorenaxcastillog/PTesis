 We have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars. This was the perfect solution because you can place the tie-down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long, so they will fit around large or small bars. We had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with wouldn't reach, but it was very easy to do. I also like this product because it doesn't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision
