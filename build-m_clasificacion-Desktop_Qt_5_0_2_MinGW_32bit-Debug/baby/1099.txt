 I am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the Toddler Bundle Me is too small for their children. Maybe these people received the Infant version instead of the Toddler version? I have a 13-month-old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles, and she's got plenty of room in this thing. We received the Infant Bundle Me as a shower gift, so I was eager to jump to the Toddler version. It's warm, fits her Jeep stroller perfectly, and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers. Very satisfied.
