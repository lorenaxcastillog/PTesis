 Purchased this potty for my 2 year old daughter. She enjoyed just sitting on it. It's comfortable and fits her just right. She'll even sit and read while she goes. Love the pull out bowl feature. Great for dumping and cleaning in a jiffy. My daughter even feels proud because she can help dump it. Easy to use. No buttons, no whistles, no ways for it to fall apart. Thrilled we picked a terrific potty the first time. We're getting a second one in a different color for her bedroom upstairs since she's starting to use it more often. Highly recommended
