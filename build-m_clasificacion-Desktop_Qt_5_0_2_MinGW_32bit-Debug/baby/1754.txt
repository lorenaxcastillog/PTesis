 You never know what is on the table you feed your kids off of. I mean, yes they may wipe them down, but else have they cleaned with that same rag??? We have never had a problem with the suction cups not sticking. It fits in our diaper bag just fine.(its about the same size as a bottle, maybe an inch or two longer) When we are done, we dump any solids onto our plate. Roll it up and take it home. It rinses off with great ease. We love ours
