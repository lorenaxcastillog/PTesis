 Our oldest child is ready to use a booster seat! I was tired of transferring the car seats from the Minivan to my WRX whenever I wanted to take our oldest with me in my car. So we bought this booter seat to stay in the WRX's trunk until needed. It works great! It is comfy for my daughter, light weight, and very easy to use. We were surprised, it is much bigger in real life that it looks in the photos, and on ours the colors are reversed. The dark blue fabric is in the center with the light blue on the outside. The cup holders are awesome and are better quality than you think 20 bux would get you. We are very impressed and will be buying another one as the other three kids grow out of their car seats! Also, this is one of the few boosters that qualifies for free shipping
