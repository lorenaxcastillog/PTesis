 As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome. This chair is wonderful. It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean. I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean. The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher. Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all. I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends
