 This is a great product for any parent. I love how easy it is once you get the hang of how to get it on (watch the included video) and how cuddly my newborn is when I get her in it. I can cook, take a walk or just sit on the couch and feel like I don't have to worry about her head flopping all over or hanging on to her. She loves the closeness and so do I! I live in Texas and can say that so far it's not too hot. I liked the one I got for a gift so much I ordered another
