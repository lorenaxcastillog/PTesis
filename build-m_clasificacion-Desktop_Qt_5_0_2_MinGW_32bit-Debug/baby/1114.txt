 I bought this for my baby when he was a month old. He is now 4 months old and loves it. I have never had to change the batteries yet. He doesnt pay much attention to the lights or movement so I just have it set to play the music and sounds. He is impossible to get to sleep without it. Even if I am staying somewhere else with him, this is a must pack! With it I can feed him, bathe him, and lay him down, push the button and leave the room. I rarely have to go back in and start it again he falls asleep to it so quickly. I only hope when he gets old enough to activate it himself that he doesnt stay awake just to watch it.
