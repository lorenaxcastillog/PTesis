 This item is great if you have someone who is incontinent and want to protect the mattress. It is not limited to babies. I am using for my 26 year old disabled son and it will absorb one soaking by an adult before it is saturated. We use it as a backup to his attends and it has protected the matress. We now have a grandbaby coming and will be buying more for the crib. I would recommend this to anyone who needs this type of coverage, easy to wash, easy to use and it does the job of protecting the mattress
