 I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features. However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward. I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking. Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before. I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem. I am truly disappointed. Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears. I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue. I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem. HELP!!!
