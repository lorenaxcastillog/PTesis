 This tent was a much needed item after my son 18m climbed out of his crib but then was not emotionally ready for his daybed yet. Since I needed it ASAP I could not wait for shipping so I called local stores. It wasn't at a few baby stores, which surprised me but I found it at Babies r US. I wanted the original one without side enclosures but could not find it. I guess there's a good reason they changed the design and I trust it was from wise consumers input. Anyway, setting up the tent part was a snap but affixing it to our crib was the challenge. We have a convertbable 4 in 1 crib that has a headboard higher than the drop rail side. This means the front and back vertical poles aren't even which causes a problem when trying to secure the super strong velcro fasteners.It would leave it crooked and possibly able to slide since the corners would not be resting stable as the must be. We found a way to level it, since I was not gonna give up. My hubby mounted an old broomstck behind the backboard even with the front and we got it level, well rested and snug on the crib perimeter.My complaint of taking time and effort is based on good safety so I say it for preparation not to disway your purchasing. The velcro hoops are so tough to pry open and then fasten it worked me out. Also, when inserting the mattress we found it much easier if two people do it so they can get it flat and then drop it into the net rather than trying to sinch down the sides. The enclosure is soo snug that it will make it hard to adjust if you drop one side down first. All that to say, my son loves it and was so eager to get back into his crib lastnight. I was a at peace knowing he wont fall trying to climb out again
