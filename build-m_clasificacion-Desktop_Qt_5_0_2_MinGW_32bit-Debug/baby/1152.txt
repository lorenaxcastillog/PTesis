 My 4 month old loves to suck on her Baby Bjorn and this bib has really been nice. I just throw the bib in the wash and my Baby Bjorn is without all the baby drool. BRU where I live doesn't carry it so I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I didn't even know these bibs existed until I saw another baby in chewing on her Baby Bijorn with one of these bibs on. When I ordered this I thought I was getting one bib, but they are in a 2-pack.
