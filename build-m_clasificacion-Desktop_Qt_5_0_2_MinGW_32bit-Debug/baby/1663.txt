 I just received this stroller yesterday. I am 9 months pregnant and I was able to bring it inside and put it together by myself in less than 15 minutes. I did notice that the right break had been crushed in shipping. I called Graco this morning and they are sending me a new one for free, no questions asked. The stroller is a bit longer than it is portrayed in the picture, but it is still smaller than the Duo Glider, and it handles wonderfully. It is definately something I would not mind taking to the mall! I love how the rear basket can be dropped down, not being able to access it with the baby seat in was a peave of mine with my quattro tour single. It is a little tough to get the baby seat in and out because there is not a lot of space, but it is nice that it is so compact. I am sure I will get better with practice. If you are looking for a double stroller, this is the one to buy!
