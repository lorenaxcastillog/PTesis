 When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing
