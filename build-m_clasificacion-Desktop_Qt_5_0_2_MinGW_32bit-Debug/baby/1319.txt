 I bought a blue one for my baby so I could see to change her diapers in the middle of the night without turning on bright lights. I keep it on my nightstand and carry the budy to her crib. It's safe to set it down in the crib next to her. It comes on automatically when you pick it up from its base and shuts off again when you set it back down on the base. The base is magnetic, so don't keep it close to any electonics like TVs or computers. I love it so much that I bought an orange one for my stepson's room. The orange one glows red when the light is on. Then I bought three more as gifts for various friends and family with young children. And today, I went ahead and bought the green one for myself. They stay lit for 10 hours so it's great for all the power outages we get here in the winter. I also use it to get ready for bed or to find things in my room at night while my husband is sleeping since he gets up to go to work much earlier than me. It's bright enough to help me find my way around in the dark but not bright enough to wake him or the baby. It's also great as a guest night light. And it has a very soft glow that doesn't hurt your eyes when you need to get up in the middle of the night.
