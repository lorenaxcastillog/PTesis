 I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub. I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off. I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool. The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1. I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price
