 We bought this the day after our son came home and we had one night of constant worry. We had planed on using a bassinet by the bed but I had an emergency c-section and it was too difficult to get out of bed to get to him. He is now 2 months and we still love it. We don't have to worry about him at all during the night and he is very accessible for breastfeeding. We have a king size bed and it fits fine. It also makes it much easier to reach over and put a hand on him to quiet him during the night
