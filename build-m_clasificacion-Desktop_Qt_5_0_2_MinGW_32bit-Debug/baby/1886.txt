 We had a Diaper Genie, it's a total waste of money and plastic. The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors. My son's room smelled as if we threw the diapers in an open garbage. We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM. It's awesome! The greatest thing about it is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors. WOW!! It has a "clean air" venting system which is totally 100% silent. I actually though it was broken because it made NO noise! It runs on D batteries that last about 9 months. There is a little light that briefly flashes to let you know that the lid is secure and the vent system is working. It uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags--saving us money. The only drawback is that occasionally you will shut the lid and it won't fully secure. You'd know that by two clues, the first being that the little green light won't flash. Later you'll get the second clue--your baby's room will start to smell! I now check to see if the light is on each time I put a diaper in to make sure the lid is secure. We love this product so much. Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags. It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting. I highly recommend using this diaper holder, it's the best
