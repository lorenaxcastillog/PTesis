 I *LOVE* this product. It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro. In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles. I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out. On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme. However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot. Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty. It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling. On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free. The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures. It is trickier to find, but worth the search. The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier. The velcro is quite versatile.
