 Hy wife was having a hard time sleeping while pregnant. One night as I watched her toss and turn I decided to do soemthing for her. I went to Target and bought her the boppy body pillow. That night she slpet sound for the first time in over a month. She drags the thing from room to room in the house, she lays on it to watch tv and to sleep. It does take up some room in the bed, but it is well worth me having a little less room for her to sleep sound. Also a few times I have stolen it and used it while I lay on the ground and watch football. It is very comfy. I have never been a pregnant woman, but from what my wife tells me this is a must have
