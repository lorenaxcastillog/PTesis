 I searched online for sage colored crib bedding for weeks before my daughter was born and finally settled on something close. I was satisfied that it matched well enough to maintain the cuteness of her nursery (of utmost importance) and was affordable at the same time. I had seen the breathable bumpers but opted for the "cuter" bedding, confident that my child would be safe. My daughter started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks which meant I was not going into her room for 7-9 hours at a time, depending on the night. Even though I swaddle her for sleeping, she still manages to travel around her crib during the night as well as during longer naps. One morning when I heard her wake up, I went into her room to find that she had wiggled her way down to the southwest corner of her crib and her face was pressed up against the "adorable, nursery-matching, affordable" crib bumper. I jerked that bumper out of the bed and ran down to order a breathable bumper. Since I put it on her crib she has been pressed up against it two or three times and is able to breath. I am delighted because I think it's actually cuter than the one I had before and I don't have to worry at all (at least about that!). It's a very clean look and the green gingham matches the crib skirt I got perfectly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fit. It comes in 2 pieces: one for the side of the crib that moves up and down and one for the other 3 sides. This leaves 2 openings, one at each end of the front of the crib, that an arm or leg could potentially get stuck in. It hasn't been a problem for us yet as she has quit the southwest travelling and now just spins in place. However, I would much rather risk a let getting stuck than having a suffocated baby. I have no regrets about buying this and am advising all of my pregnant friends to consider the breathable option over the puffy ones
