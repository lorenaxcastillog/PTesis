 I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go. I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer. I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with. This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over. I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it. When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier. I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with. Beware, my husband calls this the "Sperm Pillow", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow.
