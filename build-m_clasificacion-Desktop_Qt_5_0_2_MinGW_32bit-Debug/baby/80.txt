 I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed. We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us). While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one. The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars. ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible. It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings. The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches. These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds. It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work. And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have. That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing. I only wish it were better made and more thought out.
