 We love the Urban Bundle Me!! It is a wonderful product and I would highly recommend it! I was so frustrated with the blanket falling off the car seat all the time and this is the perfect solution!! We live in California so the Urban Bundle Me was a better option than the traditional one (which I have also but use in the stroller) it keeps my son nice and warm and shielded from rain and wind. The only negative I think is the zipper which could be better quality. It fit my Peg Prego Car Seat perfectly.
