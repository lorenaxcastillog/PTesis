 Ever since our first child was born, I have had trouble breastfeeding. I produce a copious amount of milk and find it is extremely difficult to teach my tiny newborns to latch on properly. Therefore, I have relied heavily on this little electric Medela pump for all six of our newborns. I have read several reviewers say that the pump is sufficient only for occasional pumping sessions, but that has not been my experience. I actually stopped breastfeeding two of our newborns entirely until they were each about six weeks old and could latch on properly without damaging me. I used this pump to express milk seven to eight times a day for those six weeks and never had a problem. The motor kept on going strong until the last baby. Now, all that said, I will say that I am planning on purchasing a double pump for our seventh, due in ten weeks. I anticipate the same struggles with breastfeeding him that I have had with all the others and I would like to be able to pump both sides at once. Pumping then feeding baby from a bottle can consume my entire day, and pumping quickly will be a welcome help.
