 We recently used this with my 26 month old son on his Britax Marathon. It was so simple. With my husband's help, we were able to attach it to the carry-on while my son remained sleeping in his seat. My son is a real busy body and hates strollers, so I worried that he would not want to sit in it during our layover after being stuck in a plane for 4 hours, but he loved it. He actually couldn't wait to sit in it and be wheeled through the airport. Once we got to our final destination, he actually threw a fit because we would not take the seat out of the car and wheel him inside the house
