 this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall
