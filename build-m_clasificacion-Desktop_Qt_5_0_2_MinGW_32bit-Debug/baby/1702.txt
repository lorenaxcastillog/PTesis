 This stroller is worth every penny. The pivot wheel is fantastic. I have friends with their jog stollers and the stationary wheel and they struggle to turn it when we're out for walks. This one is so smooth and manuverable. I think the best feature is the sunshade. It is so much bigger than all of the other strollers. It really does a great job of keeping the sun off my baby's skin. 2 wishes: I wish it had a tray for the baby to keep cheerios & a sippy cup and I wish that it reclined more
