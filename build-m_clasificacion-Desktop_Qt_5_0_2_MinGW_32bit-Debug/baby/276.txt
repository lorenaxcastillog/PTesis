 I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday. (only available in store at Babies R Us). It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children. Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back. Pro: -The range was great. Whole house, plus 800ft outside. -No interference. I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference. -Easy to setup. -Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony) Cons: -Controls are not very straightforward. -The unit always hisses. It is not sound/voice activated. -The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed. When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did. The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on. -The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units. With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the "off" mode. You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on. Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red. We have been using the Sony 910 for 3 years with our first child. I guess it has spoiled us
