 Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly. I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old.
