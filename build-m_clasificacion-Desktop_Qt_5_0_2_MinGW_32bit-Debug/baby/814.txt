 My baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room, my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare. When reflux got better at month 4 We finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool, it has rechargeable batteries, image and sound are clear enough, night vision works perfect, monitor is not bulky at all (no color at all though), and we managed to tie camera to the crib's headboard and worked great for us.
