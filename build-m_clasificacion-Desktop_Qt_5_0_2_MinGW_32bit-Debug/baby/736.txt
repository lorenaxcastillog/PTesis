 I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments. I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training. My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty. He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process. I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, "just like him". So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool
