 I absolutely love this mirror. It definitely captures her attention when she starts fussing. The lights aren't as visible during daylight hours, but that's to be expected. We just took a trip and it was hugely helpful and I love the size of the mirror. I can see her very well and she can see herself too. I had purchased a regular mirror - (SafeFit) which serves it's purpose, but for a few extra dollars this one works for her and me :) You won't be dissapointed. I also love that the music stays on.
