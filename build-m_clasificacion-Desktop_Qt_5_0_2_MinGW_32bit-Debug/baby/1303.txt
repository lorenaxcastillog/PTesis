 If you have a fussy baby or just bottle feed, Dr. Brown's are the best. We have twin girls and first 3 months they were gased up and it was not fun. Someone recommended Dr. Brown's bottles, which we were willing to try anything, and they were the best thing we have ever used. If you have a fussy baby then you will know what I am talking about. If you are giving a gift for a baby shower, this is the best gift you could give. I can't say enough good things are Dr. Brown's. I was upset our doctor did not tell us about these bottles, instead she had us giving them drops and buying the most expensive formula on the market. Nothing worked until these bottles
