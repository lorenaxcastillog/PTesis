 This was a much needed and welcome addition to our existing Summer Secure Surround Gate. We actually use this for a dog that we have who had a major surgery on his leg and needed to be "penned up" while he recovered. The extra two panels were advertised on the box but I could only find them here. Price was fair and shipping was, too. Arrived in a timely fashion. They came in a plain box that was not descriptive but they are true Summer product and work well. Great for growing children, pets, etc. Thanks for having 'everything' Amazon
