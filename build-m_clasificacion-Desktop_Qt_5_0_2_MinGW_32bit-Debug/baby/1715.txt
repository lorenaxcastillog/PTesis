 We love our placemat! We have a 9 month old and she really likes to feed herself. This makes going to restaurants great for all of us. Kate can eat her cheerios etc and we do not have to worry about the table not being clean or Kate trying to teeth on the table etc. I have also used it on the airplane and it was great! It is great quality and easy to clean. It rolls up nicely and fits easily into our bag. Everywhere we go people ask where we found this great item! I highly recommend this for families who love to eat out or fly
