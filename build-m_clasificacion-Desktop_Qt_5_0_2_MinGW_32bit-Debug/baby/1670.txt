 We recently just bought this tub after having one of those convertible tubs which we hated. This tub is great and my daughter loves it. Her long legs aren't scrunched like in the other tub and we don't have to worry when she squirms because all the sides are soft. It is easy to fill and drain and travel with. The bottom isn't slippery so although she can't sit up without assistance she is able to sit up in this tub without slipping. We highly recommend this tub. The Jr. size is perfect for the younger months....she just turned 4 months and maybe we will even get the bigger one...the deluxe!! This makes bathtime enjoyable for us all!
