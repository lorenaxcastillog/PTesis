 Just received the bag. The material seems very strong. A reviewer on another site mentioned that the only thing missing is a cushioned shoulder strap, so what I plan to do is use the removable velcro cushions that came with my daughter's infant carseat and put them on the straps so that my shoulders won't hurt. Haven't used it yet but plan to take it on a plane real soon, I'm just happy that the booster seat is so awesome and that it folds. Update: didn't need the cushions because it's pretty light anyway. carseat fits well, it protects the seat well when you check it at the airport.
