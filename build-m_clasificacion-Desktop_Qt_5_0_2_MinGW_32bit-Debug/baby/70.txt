 I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful. The twist-tie closure is complicated. They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing. I recommend the Lansinoh bags. They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing. You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer. They pour great - no spills!
