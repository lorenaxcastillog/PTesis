 This is a great walker. The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger. My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely. Amazon sells model #14570, so don't worry, the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary. Also, a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk
