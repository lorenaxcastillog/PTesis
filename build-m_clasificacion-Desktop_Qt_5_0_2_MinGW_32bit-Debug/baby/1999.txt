 I just received the stroller. Assembly took 15-20 min. Tried it right away with my 3 month old baby - she felt asleep 5 min after I put her in the stroller /at the reclined position/. The ride is smooth and soft, it's comfortable for me and for my baby-girl. The rolling pad will be really useful in the summer - we leave in Arizona. The canopy isn't large, but it works - you can position it even in front of the baby so it'll protect her from the wind /from the waist up of course/! We love it and I highly recommend it. It's perfect for that price!!
