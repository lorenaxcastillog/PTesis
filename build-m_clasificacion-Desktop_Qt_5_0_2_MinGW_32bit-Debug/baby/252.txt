 We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected
