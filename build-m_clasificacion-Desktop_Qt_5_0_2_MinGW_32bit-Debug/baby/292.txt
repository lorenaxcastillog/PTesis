 We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly. Our children are 2.5 and 10 months. Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support. Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric. The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it. It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!
