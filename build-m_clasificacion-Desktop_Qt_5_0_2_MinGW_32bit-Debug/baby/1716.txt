 My friend has one of these for her 18 month old daughter. It's very convenient for use in restaurants, as it keeps the inevitable mess confined to the mat, and when you're getting ready to go, you can slide the mess into the little pocket for quick disposal. It suction cups to the table and your child has an instant food/toy/mess mat that is not only convenient for mom and dad, but is also appealing for baby to touch and play with. I am going to be having a daughter this year and have registered for one of these. I think it's a great addition to the diaper bag
