 I think this is a great quality product, and I love the idea of it. However, I find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it. It's not very soft and it's just so big for him right now. I can get him to sleep in it only if he's completely zonked out beforehand. I think the mini co-sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning. The original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it. I do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many, many times
