 I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks. The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature. It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it. After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all. The internal battery is soldered in place. Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby
