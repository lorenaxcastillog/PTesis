 I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems
