 We just ordered this crib last weekend and have already received it and put it together. It looks really great. However, when we received the box from UPS, it looked terrible and we were really afraid that the crib would be damaged. It looks fine, although we did have to touch up a few places with a stain pen. I would recommend that you inspect each piece carefully before putting the crib together. Also, the directions that came with the crib said nothing about the washers that were included in the hardware. We just sort of had to figure out to use them with the bolts. SO, if you order this crib and it comes with washers, don't forget to put them in, because the directions won't tell you to! We were impressed by how fast the crib arrived and the free shipping was great too. It wasn't terribly difficult to put together, pretty sturdy, and I would say it was worth what we paid for it
