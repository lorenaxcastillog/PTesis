 I used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space. The Kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces (i.e. 72 inches total), so if you need extra length, you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length. The extension was easy to use and is very sturdy. The gate looks uniformed and you cannot tell it is several separate pieces. The only 'issue' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door (i.e. 24 inch section with the open/close swing door) or use it as an end piece. I was not able to continously connect extensions to one another (not sure if I did this incorrectly or not.) But nonetheless, the extension worked fine and I love my new gate
