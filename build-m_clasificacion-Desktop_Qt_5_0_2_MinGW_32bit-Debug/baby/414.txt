 The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance. The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold. If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads. I am returning mine to the store. :
