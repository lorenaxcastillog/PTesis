 This is the BEST product for keeping your child warm when strolling around in cold weather. It's like wrapping him/her up in a cozy sleeping bag. Our son loves it and so do we. It's been wonderful for our little boy (bought at 8mo) however he's a very tall infant (28" at the time, 30" now at 9.5mo). I question whether this product will work for him as a toddler since he's already in 18mo-old clothing. This is why we skipped the infant size. Also, don't purchase this product thinking it will completely cover your child. It comes up to their upper chest. The child will still need to wear a coat/hat/mittens. The flap does come higher, however our son doesn't like to have it pulled up and fights it. All-in-all, this product does what we purchased it for
