 I ordered the Safari comforter, dust ruffle, sheets (yellow and green!), rugs, fleece blankets with animals in the corners, and bumper pads for my boys' room - and it is all so cute!!! It is restful and fun at the same time. I love that you can order only the parts the you need. Only one of my boys needed bumper pads, but both needed everything else. I had a hard time finding a place where I could get a comforter and dust ruffle without the bumper pads. I prefer the yellow sheets over the lime green. We have lots of guests, and everyone comments on how cute the boys' room is, but even better is that the boys love it
