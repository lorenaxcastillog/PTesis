 I am so greatfull to this pump! I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each, while working full time, taking vacations (without the kids), etc. I also have the car adapter which is awesome, I was able to pump to and from my work, (which is over an hour away), while driving. I only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros! The warranty is only good for a year, but mine is now three years old and still going strong. We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year, if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one! Best of luck
