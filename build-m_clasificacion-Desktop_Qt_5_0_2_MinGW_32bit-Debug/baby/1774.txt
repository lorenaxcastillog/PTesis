 This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often. We have a more expensive, larger, "safer" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one. Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground. We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel. The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes. There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get. The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try. The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new. We should get sales rep compensation, because no one really had these in Paris and all our friends saw ours and got one too
