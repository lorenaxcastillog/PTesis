 I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail. 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements. They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks. Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks. How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces. Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college. We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough. I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it.
