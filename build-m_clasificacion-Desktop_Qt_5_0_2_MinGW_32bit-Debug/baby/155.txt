 I was happy when this product arrived. It arrived in great time. I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets. It states that it should be used in the last trimester, I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat. I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong. It will pick up my heart beat, but not the babys. I can't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester. The greatest thing about this is the cd's I play them for the baby every now and then
