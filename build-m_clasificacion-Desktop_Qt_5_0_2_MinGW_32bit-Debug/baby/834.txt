 We adopted a little boy when he was 2 days old. He was slightly preemie and weighed just over 5 pounds. He wouldn't have anything to do with the soothie for preemies, but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face. We had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked, he didn't seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several: avent, dr. brown, gerber and playtex. I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled. In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon. I love the width of the bottles because it's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean. The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing. Our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well. This bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also. Double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn't have any leaking problems. I'm so glad I found these!
