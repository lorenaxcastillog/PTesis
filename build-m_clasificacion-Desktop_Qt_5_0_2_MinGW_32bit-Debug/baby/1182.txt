 I originally purchased Avent everything - bottle warmer, microwave steam sterilizer, etc and therefore thought the bottles would be great. However, the Avent bottles leaked everywhere and you could hear my son sucking in tons of air when he ate, causing a tremendous amount of gas etc. Because I had used Avent, I bought the wide neck Dr. Brown bottles and they have been a life saver. I threw all of my Avent bottles away. The Dr. Brown bottles NEVER leak and my son rarely has any gas and is so much happier - I also nurse him and these nipples seem to fit my son's little mouth similarly to the breast. The bottles are also easy to clean - just one more (easy) step than other bottles.
