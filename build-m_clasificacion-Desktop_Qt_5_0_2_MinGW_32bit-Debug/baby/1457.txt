 I've been searching for a stroller that met all my needs and this is it. I have twins that are 10 months old and I have used 4 different strollers since they were born. None of them did everything I needed until now. I needed something for every day that could fit in my van and I could also take on the beach. This stroller fits in the small space (about 19" deep) in the back of my van without having to remove the wheeles. It opens and closes so quickly and easily. You just unfold it and it locks into place. Closing is just as easy with one hand. The seats recline separately, the front wheele swivle is wonderful. I can easily push this stroller with one hand. I have been able to get through all doors, but I will say that there have been a couple places that was a tight squeeze. There is a good basket under the stroller but there is a bar above it so you can't put anything too big. I love that it has seat cushions that you can remove and wash. It has a foot brake but no hand break so I'm not sure if this would be a good stroller for serious joggers. It's great to find something that will make my life a little easier
