 This is by far the best bathtub we ever used with our three boys. Yes, it does leak if you don't read the directions and set it up properly - I got one of those leaky surprises too. Then I went back to the setup directions and found the problem and fixed it. My youngest has loved bathtime ever since. I especially liked how it converts to a bath seat, as I hated the one I used to use with my other kids. I'm only sorry my "baby" is about to outgrow it! This has been the easiest bathtub I've ever used, especially with a slippery newborn. Okay, so it's not the most intuitive as far as setting up - you WILL have to ready the accompanying directions! - but once you set it up, you'll be glad you made the effort. A great product
