 I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!! Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o
