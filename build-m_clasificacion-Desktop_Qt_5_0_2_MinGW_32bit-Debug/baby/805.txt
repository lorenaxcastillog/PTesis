 I haven't traveled with the bag yet, but the quality seems good. The bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal. My stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized. The stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag (the top thin long end is where the zipper is). They are removable wheels, so its no problem. With all the wheels on, the bag can't zip closed. That is why I gave it only 4 stars. I bought the bag because I will be traveling overseas soon and I don't want my stroller damaged during the long flight.
