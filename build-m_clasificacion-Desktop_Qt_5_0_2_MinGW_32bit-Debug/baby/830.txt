 As im sure all mothers can relate, my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart. I looked at a lot of local stores for a cover. I couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt $80. This one is great! its reasonably priced, wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings. i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around, but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts!!
