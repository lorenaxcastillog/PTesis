 I am a daily user of the Pump in Style Advanced breast pump and very happy with the product. I've had to replace the Adapter and the Ice Pack which after contacting the Medela company, they replaced it for free and shipped the items out to me pronto! Make sure to have extra membranes on hand as they do wear out after frequent use; this will affect the efficiency of the pumping if you have faulty membranes. Their customer service line has also helped me out with troubleshooting which I have greatly appreciated as well. I've been pumping for 9 & 1/2 months now and plan to go the full year with the help of my Medela breast pump.
