 We love this tub. We never bothered with the hammock so I can't comment on it. We still use it and she is almost 2 years old! We used the reclining side when she was a baby and used the toddler side after she could sit up on her on. It is so handy to be able to stand up straight at the kitchen sink and bathe her. Before I bought a tub, I thought about getting the Primo tub because it had such great reviews. However, when I saw it in the store, it looked gigantic. I took a chance on the less expensive First Years tub and I can't imagine anything being better.
