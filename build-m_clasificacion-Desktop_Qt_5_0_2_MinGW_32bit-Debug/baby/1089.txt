 The Britax Marathon is wonderful. As a concerned parent I wanted a seat that would offer a 5-point harness for as long as possible. Thats where the Britax Marathon shines through all the other seats that I reviewed. The Marathon allows any child to remain in this seat up to 49" in length and or 65 lbs. Thats equivelent to a five your old. Not so happy with the color selection that Britax offers for a boy. (...) The seat arrived shortly thereafter and was nicely boxed. I did have difficulty finding the instructions that were tucked underneathe the front seat fabric which I thought was a strange place to put them. However the seat was extremely easy to install and did not take up much room in my VW Jetta. Wonderful Seat and price
