 Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting. We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it. It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement. There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well. The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old. Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up! It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat. After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)
