 I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!! She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her. She really enjoys bathtime. And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby... you will really enjoy it. I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her. After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place. Caution: Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size. This tub is perfect if you do that! The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use. Please read the directions. Both you and your child will appreciate that you did
