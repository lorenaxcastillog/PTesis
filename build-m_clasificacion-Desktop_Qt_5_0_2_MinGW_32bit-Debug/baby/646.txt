 After I had my 2nd son, we bought a Graco double stoller, but it was SO long, heavy and cumbersome that I only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it. We bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and I love it! Great stoller, lightweight, easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back. It's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too. I wish that I had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment. I highly recommend this stoller, but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller
