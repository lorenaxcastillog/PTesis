 This is my second First Years Warmer with my second child. The first one got TONS of use and lasted the whole first year of heating up bottles for my son. Now with another child, I decided I can splurge on a new one since the bottom was starting to burn out a bit. I highly recommend it. The bottles warm in about a minute and is very easy. It's all easy to do while holding a baby in one hand too. The only negative I see if I've yet to master how much water to throw in. It works by putting in a small amount of water right into the unit and then it heats up essentially steaming the bottle so it's an even warming process. The problem is most likely me because I never pay attention to how much water I'm putting in to note for the future if it was right or not. But worst case I do a little more a second time, or give a minute to cool down. Usually it's perfect. With all the choices out there, I highly recommend this one.
