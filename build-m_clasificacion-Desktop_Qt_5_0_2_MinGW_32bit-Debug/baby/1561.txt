 When my baby was a newborn, I felt I didn't have enough control to safely carry her in this sling. It just seemed uncomfortable for her head - it's not like the picture of the (very THIN!?) woman with newborn - they must have proped the baby's head up to take that picture. I felt like she was getting lost in the folds. HOWEVER, now she's 6 months and I can wear her on my hip. The New Native sling is awesome - it's simple, the material is very nice and soft, I can take it on and off easily and most important - she is totally comfy, secure and entertained, watching my every move!
