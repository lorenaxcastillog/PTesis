 I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it. But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy. After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL. Piece of junk.
