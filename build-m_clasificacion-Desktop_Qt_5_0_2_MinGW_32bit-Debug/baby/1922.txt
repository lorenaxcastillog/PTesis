 This carseat is the best! Not only is it the easiest installation ever (we actually went back and re-read instructions because we couldn't believe it could be so easy), but it's also a very safe seat. They have the special bicycle padding to add more protection for baby. The safety features are outstanding. The child restraint is so easy to use with non-twisting straps, an easy lock system and a pull belt to tighten the harness without struggle. And, it looks great too! We have the Explorer print and love it. All our Chicco products are fabulous (Polly high chair and the playard too)
