 This Portable Cot has been wonderful! We purchased it for the holidays when we would be visiting friends and family. My daughter is two and does not fit in a pack and play comfortably. She could not sleep on an air mattress or the floor because many of them have hardwood floors. To keep her warm we opted for something off the floor and we found this. It is so easy to put up and take down and it stores nicely. This is the greatest thing we could have bought for the holiday travels
