 I have been using the Graco Snugride since my son was about 2 months old - he's now five months old. The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry. As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat. The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness. The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily. I have found that I have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly, which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car. Apart from that, the seat provides good value for the price
