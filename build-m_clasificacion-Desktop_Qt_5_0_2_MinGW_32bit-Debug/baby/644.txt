 I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair. It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad. I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with. Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc. This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges. It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin. The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty. It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with. I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys. This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe. I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that
