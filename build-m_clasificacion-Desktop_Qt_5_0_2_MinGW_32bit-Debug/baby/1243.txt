 My husband and I have tried many different bottle types and brands and have decided that these are the best. My 6 week old daughter adjusted well to them. The original brown nipples wear out very quickly but, the silicone ones are much nicer and will last longer. These bottles are very easy to use and clean. My husband prefers the soft bottle liners over the preformed dropins. The soft ones haven't leaked on us once but the formed ones have slipped out from under the ring a couple of times spilling formula everywhere. The formed ones also make it harder to screw the lid on tight enough causing leaks. The soft liners might take a little bit longer to put on the bottle and deal with, but in the long run it takes less time because you don't have to go change your clothes every time the preformed ones leak. They are worth every penny I spent on them. Even though they may cost more than standard bottles because of having to buy the liners, they help prevent gas and colic. THey are absolutely wonderful
