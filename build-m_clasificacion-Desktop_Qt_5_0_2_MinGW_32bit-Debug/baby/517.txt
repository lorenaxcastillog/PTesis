 So many convertibles car seat to choose from but the Britax Marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum. I was very pleased that the Marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness. No other seat that I reviewed offered this feature. I also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap. My son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his Peg Perego Primo Viaggio. (...)They offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color I wanted in stock. I believe I made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments
