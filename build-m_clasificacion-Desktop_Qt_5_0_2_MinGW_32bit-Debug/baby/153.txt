 I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend. After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working. When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more. I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service. They had no problem replacing the unit. Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once. And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row. To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work. Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on. Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated. I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was. I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.
