 I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining. I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking. I never could find the place that is was leaking. So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair. My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box. He wanted to use it in the family room. I love it because it is only 2 pieces. It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color. Great price and great size. I recommend this item
