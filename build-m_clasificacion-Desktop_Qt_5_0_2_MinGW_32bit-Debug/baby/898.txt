 I purchased the Medela Double Select Pump in anticipation for the arrival of my second child per the recommendation of a relative who had great success with this model (we both had a terrible time with manual pumps in the past). I am extremely pleased with this pump. I can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction, motor, malfunctioning equipment, etc. It is extremely easy to put together and take apart, as well as easy to clean. You will have to buy a pack of Medela bottles before the first use as they are not included. And yes, the motor is a little noisy, but not unbearably so. It has neither disrupted my children's sleep, for example, nor become irritating for me. It is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side. Additionally, the Medela company has a very solid reputation and I understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products. I think that this pump is a wise choice for part-time use (not more than once or twice a day, at that). I've had much success and I think that most of you will too
