 I'm a grandma and didn't want to have a high chair sitting in my kitchen when I only use it occasionally. This seat is great and a bargain. I like that it can fit on any chair and can be adjusted to different angles. The fabric cover is easy to wipe clean and the cushion provides sufficient padding. I considered one of the seats that slide over the counter or table, but decided on this one because I can have the baby facing me directly. This makes for easy feeding. I am very happy with the feeding seat
