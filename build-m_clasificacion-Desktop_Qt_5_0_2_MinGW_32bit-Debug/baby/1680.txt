 I live in a studio apt. with limited space and this is perfect for me. I love the storage on the bottom I keep all my sons blankets and sheets in there. It is just the right size and fits snuggly in the corner. I do however have the same problem as another mom. My son likes to scoot himself diagionally and ends up sleeping with his face against the wall. But his nose does not press against it and the walls are ventilated so I dont worry to much. I have cats and the canopy works perfect in keeping them out of the sleeper. The sheets are very pricey at about 15$ each one of my complaints. I like the fact that the matress has a wipeable surface. It is so much easier to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone; as well as grandparets who are looking for something when thier grandkids come to visit
