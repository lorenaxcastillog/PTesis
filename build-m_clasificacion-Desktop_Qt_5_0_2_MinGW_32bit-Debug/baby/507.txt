 After checking out all of the boppys, I decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers. I have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it! It is so soft, and I have washed it a few times with no problems (I haven't put it in the dryer, though). It does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up, etc., of course, since it is not a waterproof cover. However, I was not expecting it to be waterproof, and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof, so it's not a big deal to me. Since I have the plain white boppy, nothing shows through, but this might be an issue for decorated boppys
