 I registered for and received these Medela bags. After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. Wow!! I will never go back to Medela. The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. Well this is the only good feature. The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that. But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
