 My little girl has had this mobile in her crib since she was a couple weeks old and she has always loved it. She used to just watch the animals move around and fall asleep to the soothing music. Now she will turn her head to watch the base when it lights up. This was a great buy for us. My only complaint would be the little remote that comes with it. The clicker is very loud... which, if you are using the remote, it's because you are trying to turn the mobile on without being seen and the loud click gets my girl's attention every time. We just don't use the clicker anymore but the fact remains that she loves the mobile itself. She'll be bummed when we have to take it down
