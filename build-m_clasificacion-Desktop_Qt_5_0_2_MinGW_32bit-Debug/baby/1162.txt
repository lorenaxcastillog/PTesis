 I purchased this toybox 2 nights ago from toysrus. It is pretty spacious and sturdy. I really do not like the lid though. It does not stay up very well. It just kind of sits on top of the toy box in these 2 slots. It doesn't actually snap into place so my five little boys constantly take it off. The drawers on the bottom just slide into an open space under the toybox, they are not actually attatched to anything either but they are nice to put the smaller toys in so they don't get lost in the bottom of the toybox.
