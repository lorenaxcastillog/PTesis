 I am totally satisfied with this carseat. It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky. My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant). There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby. I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping). But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns. My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one
