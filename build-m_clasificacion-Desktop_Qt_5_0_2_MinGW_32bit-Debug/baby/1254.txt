 Having spent money on other stroller shields that would fly away with a gust of wind, I was so happy that this one did not let me down. It is extremely secure since it has a couple of velcro straps that are actually stitched to the shield (thank you)that keep the shield in place. Others come with stickers that come right off but not this one. It actually covers the stroller all the way. Right now I am using a stroller system carriage that has a car seat in it, so it is kind of bulky, but this shield actually covers the stroller down to the foot rest and down the back behind the handles. The roominess is excellent. The cool pop up part is what makes it easier to put on too. It's a bit tricky at first to close it since you have to twist it a certain way in order to do so, but it is well worth the effort. No more fly aways and awkward folding.
