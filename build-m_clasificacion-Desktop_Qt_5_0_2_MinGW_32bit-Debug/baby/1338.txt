 The features that make it good: there is a flap on the head end that tucks behind AND under your mattress to keep it in place. The top portion is molded plastic, with a decent height, which is helpful if you're a toss/turner - you won't roll over onto it. The lower half is mesh, which one assumes is to allow air circulation, but I think it's mostly that way to allow it to fold, and be portable. There is a foam wedge at the foot end to prevent baby from "scootching" out of it. HOWEVER, this makes the sleeper short enough to only last maybe 3 months (more or less, depending on the length of the baby). I've read that other buyers had a "split mattress," but mine was not split, but was one piece. After being folded, it was obviously bent in the middle, but I solved that by just flipping the mattress over for that use. I suppose that the split mattress was designed after complaints of the mattress being bent, so not a great change in my opinion. I also liked the nightlight - just bright enough to let us see the baby, without waking her up fully. It is sized so that it would best fit in a king size bed (if you have 2 parents in bed), but we managed with a queen. After reading other reviews, and thinking about my own use of this sleeper, I've come to a conclusion: The length may be too short to use it for long, however, once baby outgrows it lengthwise, it's probably time to get him out of your bed, as he is too mobile to be in a sleeper of this design. So perhaps good planning on The First Years part
