 I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser
