 I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them. These were just about the worst!! My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding. I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped. I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day. I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain. They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt. I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them
