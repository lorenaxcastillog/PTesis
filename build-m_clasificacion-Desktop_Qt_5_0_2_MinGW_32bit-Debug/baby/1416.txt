 We have the black and white large monitor also and the picture quality from the black and white camera is much clearer than the color camera. Color samera picture looks like there is some oil on the lens or something - not necessarily grainy, just smudged looking. I have returned it for a new one to see if the color one I had was defective. I didn't see why the picture quality would differ. We'll see! Also, you never get much color so don't' buy it for that. We didn't care about the color as much as the size/portability of the monitor. Also, you can easily plug it into the TV if you want the picture on the TV instead of the monitor. Very cool idea. But overall we love these monitors. The black and white one is crystal clear, excellent sound, and good reception too. You do have to move the monitor around sometimes if something else interferes with it but this has been a very minor problem in our house. Also, if you walk in the monitor and camera path it sometimes gets static. Again, rarely a problem. And ours sits right near our phones, computers, etc. We have two monitors and can switch the A and B channels to see each of the kids rooms which is so convenient. Definitely a "can't live without it" item for our family. Although the regular black and white one is good enough if you don't care about portability/counter space. Also, we have had a great experience with Summer Infant customer service. After having the black and white monitor for a long time we noticed a low pitched hum and they sent us a replacement very quickly, no problem.
