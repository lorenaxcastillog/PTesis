 When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great. It had everything. Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came. I am so glad that I did. The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard. The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling. It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub. In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else.
