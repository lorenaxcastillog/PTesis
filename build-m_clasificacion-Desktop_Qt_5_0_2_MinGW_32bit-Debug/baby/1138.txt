 This tub is great if you dont want to confine your child too much in a full sized bathtub, but is also small enough to keep it safe for baby. Since it's a blow up tub, all the sides are soft so baby wont bonk her head. There is a drain hole at one end for easy draining, and a suction cup underneath so you can hang it up when not in use. It is also good if you are going on a trip and are not sure if there will be a tub to give baby a bath in
