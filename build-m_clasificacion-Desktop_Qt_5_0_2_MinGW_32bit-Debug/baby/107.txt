 I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one.
