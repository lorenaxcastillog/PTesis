 Our daughter is 9 months old, she is only 16lbs... but I wish I had found the Moby wrap sooner! :) We live about a mile from a large lake, and before she was born, we would walk there at least twice a week, we also do a lot of hiking. We had been using our baby Bjorn, but it was starting to hurt our backs and especially our shoulders, and the padding got lumpy after i washed it. I received my wrap on Friday, I have walked to the lake and back with my daughter in the wrap everyday since... we have tried the Joey and hug positions, and I can feel her weight a little in the Joey one, but on the way home, I turn her around into the hug position, and she falls asleep... and it feels like I'm not even carrying a baby! The weight distribution is great and now I have no excuses to not get out and exercise! :) She seems to love it too! I have two friends who are due in the next three months, and I think I will have to get them their own as baby shower gifts! I heard before i ordered it that it was hard to use, but once i read the wonderful book that comes with it, it was a piece of cake! :
