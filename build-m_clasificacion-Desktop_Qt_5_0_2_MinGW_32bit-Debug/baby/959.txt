 We bought this swing just under a year ago, when our baby was about two months old. She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it, or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us. Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile, so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son. They used it only two months, when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment. The batteries were intact, but the swing didn't work whatsoever anymore, even with new batteries. I called Fisher Price, and they were very concerned about the smoke. I didn't have the purchase receipt anymore, and wasn't sure if it was still covered by the warranty. They asked for the Product Code and Run Code, and where I bought it (Babies R Us). They are now sending me a brand new motor housing (the entire top portion of the swing, which you just attach the legs to). They are also sending a pre-paid label to put on the box, so I can send them the dead motor housing. How great is that! I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price's customer service. No receipt, and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing. Talk about gaining customer loyalty! It's good to know you can pay $130 for a baby item and get your money's worth all around. The swing itself is just wonderful. The motor is quiet, my baby loved the moving bugs, and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby. The swing's colors are great as well, soothing and neutral, instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings
