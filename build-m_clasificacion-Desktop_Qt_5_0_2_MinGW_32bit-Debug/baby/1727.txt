 My 4 month old received this dog as a gift for Christmas. It smells so lovely. He buries his head in its face to snuggle with it. I leave it in his crib until he falls asleep and then I remove it for the rest of the night. It has completely baby safe features which I really appreciate. The biggest surprise is that my 4 year old keeps sneaking it out of the baby's crib so she can sleep with it too. It is on her list for the next holiday
