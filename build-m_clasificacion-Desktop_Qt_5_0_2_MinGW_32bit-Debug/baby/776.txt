 i got this for my baby due in march. even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy. its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather. it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby. it washes well too! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you don't need it then the top part zips off and you don't have to take baby out and remove the entire product. then the next chilly day zip the top back on! great all around
