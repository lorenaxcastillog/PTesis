 This is an excellent stroller and well worth the money. My husband and I purchased the red one from BuyBuyBaby. We intended on purchasing a similar Chicco one for about ½ the price. However, after test driving them (and other brands) in the store, the Maclaren won hands down. The handles are higher (good for tall people); it is sturdier than most other umbrella strollers; it steers well; and the canopy actually works to shade the child from both sun and rain. I would recommend purchasing the organizer that allows you to carry water and other bottles with you. It is worth the extra $20 or so. When we fold up the stroller, we just flip the organizer over the front
