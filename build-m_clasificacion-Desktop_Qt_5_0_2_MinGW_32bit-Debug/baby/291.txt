 This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached. The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer. I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting. It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps. I was very disappointed in this carseat. I would not purchase it again. I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco. If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured. Try those ones first. This is an awful carseat.
