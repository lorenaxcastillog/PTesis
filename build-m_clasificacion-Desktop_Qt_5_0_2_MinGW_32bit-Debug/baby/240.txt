 We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex
