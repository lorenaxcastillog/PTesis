 I was given a hand-me-down changing pad that I used for my 1st & 2nd child but it was really looking bad when baby #3 came, so I broke down and bought this. I love it! My covers fit on snug but easily and the strap has been so nice to hold baby on for a few seconds while I grab something instead of making one of my other children stand beside the baby to keep her from rolling! My child also loves to play with the strap and it keeps her occupied during changes
