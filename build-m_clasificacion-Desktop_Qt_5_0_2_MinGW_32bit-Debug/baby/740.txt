 This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy. I love it. It warms the Avent bottles great. It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great. You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful. It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles. I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway. The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day. We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much. I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well. This is definitly worth the money
