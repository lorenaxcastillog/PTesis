 I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it. The extra extensions you can buy for it are great. I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room. I found it to be very durable and sturdy. When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in. As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set. You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose. I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though. It's sturdy but probably not for that age. It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside. I'd recommend this highly
