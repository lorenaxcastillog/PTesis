 This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it. We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability. I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall. I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great. When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive! I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something
