 My son was born premature. I breastfed for as long as I could but after he was diagnosed with severe acid reflux. I needed to find a bottle. He needed cereal in every bottle to thicken it, along with medications for pain and to help move it along his digestive track. First I tried the playtex bottles with disposable liners. The amount of gas and spit up was still quite a lot and I still had a unhappy baby. Then my doctor told me about Dr. Brown's bottles. They are a bit more expensive then others but WORTH EVERY DIME!!!! The clean up is fine too if you just throw all the pieces together in a nipple basket in the dishwasher. I will never use another bottle with my future children ever again. I am so happy I found these. My son was like a different baby from the FIRST time he used these bottles. The gas was GONE, the spit-up was decreased by well over half the previous amount. I tell every mother and soon-to-be mother I run into about Dr. Brown's bottles. I'll never buy another brand
