 We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son. Boy, were we wrong. The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart. So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again. He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.
