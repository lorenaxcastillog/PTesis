 I was very disppointed in this product. I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer, but this was the only good quality. I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching. You could smell the plastic in the milk. I'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals, especially when her liver isn't developed enough to fully detoxify them. I really wanted to love this product, but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option
