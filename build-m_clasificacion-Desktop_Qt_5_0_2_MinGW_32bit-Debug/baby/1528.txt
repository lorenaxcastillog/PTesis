 I bought this product thinking that it would work well with the other playtex bottles, nipples, etc. that I already have. It seems to be working out great. I can pump using my Medela pump right into the storage receptacles and then put them right into the fridge. If I'm on the run one afternoon, I grab one and go. It's so easy and even the cleaning is easy. Only a couple things to wash and you're done. That means a lot to me when you're constantly cleaning other things around the house. I'm one very happy customer
