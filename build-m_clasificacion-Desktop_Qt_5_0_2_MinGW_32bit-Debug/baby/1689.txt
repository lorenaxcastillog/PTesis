 I like the convenience of being able to carry this pump with me and I like that it comes with pump/freeze/serve bottles in a separate carrying case with a cooler block. Plus, the bag is good-looking and you wouldn't even know it's a breast pump. And the pump itself works well. What I was not thrilled about is that the bottles didn't come with nipples and the Medela nipples are not easy to find on their own. I had to buy a separate pump and store starter kit (4 bottles, caps, nipples) to get a decent supply. Also, the pump is a little louder than I thought it would be but if you zip the pump's compartment while you're pumping, it does cut down on the noise. Another thing is that I expected there to be different speeds of pumping like there was in the Ameda hospital pump I rented for a couple of weeks but even at $319, it has only one speed (although you can adjust the vacuum strength). Last, and this isn't directed specifically at this pump but at all pumps that can pump both breasts simultaneously... I don't think they're worth it. I don't really even pump both breasts at the same time anymore because it's not easy to sit there holding both cups over both breasts on top of adjusting the dials and possibly holding or trying to soothe a baby. I constantly broke the suction seals and dripped milk on my lap. And I spent so much time readjusting the cups and trying to get comfortable that I could have just pumped one breast at a time (which I do now). Fortunately, the Medela pump works pretty fast magic on me.
