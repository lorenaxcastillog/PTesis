 I was going to keep the receiver in our office which has a lot of computer equipment. We bought a 900 MHz monitor because most of our equipment runs on 2.4 GHz. We were hoping there would be less interference. We were surprised and very pleased with how well this monitor worked. The receiver produces a faint hum, but overall, the reception is clear. Every now and then, I hear a clicking sound over the receiver, but I'm not sure if it's the monitor or the hot air humidifier I keep in the baby's room. We are definitely pleased with this purchase
