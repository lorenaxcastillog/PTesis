 My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas. At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat. At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions. The seat was on a flat surface. He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him. I loved this seat when he first got it. I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he loved to be able to watch them play. His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level. Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat. It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised. The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor.
