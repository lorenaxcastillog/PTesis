 I tried to use my other kiddopotamus shade with my 16 mt old the other day while taking a stroll on the beach. He would not hear of it! He wanted to see out!! I searched the web trying to find another shade to cover him - This was the answer!! I did not want to pay more than 20.00 for the shade and at 15.00 this is a bagin!! I have found it extemely easy to use on my baby jogger. One windy day it did blow in but that was OK with me because I knew it was also blocking the wind from my son's face. If you are looking to extend your stroller's shade area this is the product for you!! I only wish I had found it before I got rid of my Inglesina stroller because I could not move the shade forward to block the son from my fair skinned child
