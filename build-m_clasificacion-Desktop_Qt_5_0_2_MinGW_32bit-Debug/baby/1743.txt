 It took us forever to decide on a highchair and we actually took our then 6 month-old on shopping trips to see which one he responded to the best. We found this one to be the most versatile and the least likely to catch his fingers in the tray. I also like that it has a five-point harness. I see that a lot of people had problems with their babies reaching the tray. Our son is very tall, so this wasn't a problem for us. I also find it easy to clean, the straps come off and are machine washable and I use a damp cloth to wipe it down. It folds up nicely to go to grandma's house and it's nice to have so many levels of adjustment so that we can feed from the couch if necessary. The chair leans back for those times that he eats from a bottle or wants to snooze in his chair. It wheels easily from dining room to kitchen to living room. I know that it's pricey, but it supports kids up to 50 lbs, so I plan to use it for a while and it's durable enough that I'm sure someone else will get plenty of use out of it after we're done.
