 B.O.B. Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him. Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go. One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car. Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!
