 I spent hours online and in stores comparing cribs for my grandson. Was very hesitant to purchase something this big online, especially after reading some reviews about it coming damaged, but when I saw the price, and cheap shipping, I figured it was worth a try. I am so glad I did. The crib arrived in time, in perfect shape, packed very secure, with not a scratch. The directions were easy to follow, all the parts were included, and we had it up in about an hour. (Even for two old grandparents.) My daughter spent almost $500 on her crib, and I think this one is more sturdy and better looking. Haven't had the chance to put our little guy in it yet, but so far I believe we will be very happy with it. I do plan on getting the round teether covers for the top rails, since I don't want him scratching it up with his teeth! Would recommend it to anyone, especially at this price.
