 We've had this chair for about 6 months now and love it! Our older son had a Graco one but when we stored it we lost the straps, so we had to find a new chair for the baby. I was looking for an inexpensive chair but when I saw this one with all the features I loved it immediately and decided to splurg. So glad that I did! The chair is very easy to clean and folds up small enough to fit between my frig and wall. While the trays are too big for the dishwasher, they clean up really easily with a wet wipe so that doesn't bother me.
