 Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy. The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!). My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old. And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off. Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with. I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts. I would recommend that you do not buy this item. I now have to waste more time returning it to the store
