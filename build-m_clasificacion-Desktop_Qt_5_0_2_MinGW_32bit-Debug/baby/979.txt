 I completely understand your concern. Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off. They are not built for anyone to play with them. My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch. This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it. I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme. For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile: Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out. The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying. I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib. This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit
