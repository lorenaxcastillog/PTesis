 I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it. Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son.
