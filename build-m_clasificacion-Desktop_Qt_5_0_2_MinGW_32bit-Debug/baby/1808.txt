 I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - we used this for my daughter all fall, winter and spring, and her seatbelt laid just fine - there was no difference at all. It velcros around the seatbelts, so I'm not sure what the nurses were talking about. Other than that, this thing is wonderful! My daughter was a summer baby, so we usually just used receiving blankets. But we got this in the fall and were able to use it all winter and into the spring. It kept her warm enough, even on the cold days. I would probably suggest getting the heavier version for newborns in the winter, but this worked great for our older baby in the winter. There's no need to worry about blankets or extra layers of clothes or snowsuits. The Bundle Me Lite stays attached to the carseat, all you need to do is zip it up, and you're ready to go! It detaches very easily (because it's just velcro) and can be washed. It actually acted as a protective barrier for the carseat for those "accidents." We still washed the carseat for these situations, but it greatly minimized damage! This is a fabulous "extra" for the carseat, we'll definitely be using it again with the next baby
