 1. You can't beat the price...EXCELLENT! 2. Easy to use. 3. Doesn't take up much space. I've even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well. 4. Great for warming food & bottles. Suggestions: 1. Only use distilled water in it...works much better. 2. For cleaning: Once a month use a mixture of half distilled water & white vinegar (about 2 oz. total) pour it in the warmer and turn it on. Doesn't smell great, but works FANTASTICALLY!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! P.S. I've been using this product for 6+ months now.
