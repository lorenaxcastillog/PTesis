 My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter. It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful. I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition. On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor. When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling. On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable. Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality. I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer
