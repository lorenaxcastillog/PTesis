 We had the Britax Roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them, especially with the safety ratings. When my older daughter was ready for a booster, the choice was easy -- BRITAX! My daughter loves her booster. When I first got it in the mail (we live overseas) I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn't like the side supports, but she loves them! I would like to comment on two previous comments....boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn't be used on an airplane. Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts. Second, you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat. It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt. I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great....and SAFE product
