 A few days after I got home from the hospital I was thinking of stopping to breasfeed because my nipples were so sore and in such pain (even though baby was latched on just fine). These pads worked miracles! Put them in the refrigerator and the apply them to your nipples right after feeding. You will feel GREAT! These truly saved me. Now baby is 6 months old and still breasfeeding...I'm sooooo glad I did not stop....thanks to these pads (and chamomile tea applications). They might be a bit pricey but VERY worth it!
