 I LOVE my Avent pump. Even though I knew I would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old, I was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until I knew if breastfeeding would be right for us. Now, my son is almost 6 months old and I'm still using my manual pump. I take 2 15-minute breaks each day and find that I can easily keep up with my son's milk needs. On the days that I have trouble getting my milk to flow, I find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump's efficieny. (On those nights, I nurse on one side while I pump on the other.) I would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price
