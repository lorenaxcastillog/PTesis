 Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOL My daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOL We used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth
