 I was very pleased when I saw just how beautiful this car seat was. Now that my daughter is 3 months old I feel I can give it a review. I read many things about complaints but I just don't have any. Everything works well on it. It doesn't fit well in all carts but carts weren't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it's not a bad thing about the car seat itself. All infant carriers will have the same problem. I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks. It's pretty and fits great in it's stroller. All in all, it's a great buy. Although my next time around, I'm passing up the infant carrier and going Britax. They're much safer imo from what I've read and heard
