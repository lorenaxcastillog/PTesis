 This stool is working fine for us. It is stable and safe, non-slip, and it is nice and small so I can move it out of the way easily, and light-weight so my 2 year old son can easily move it into place by himself. I am not sure that I couldn't have found a similiar stool for less money, but I like the fact that it's just plain black and white and it doesn't look tacky in the guest bath. I did try a couple of the wooden steps, and they were too big and heavy, and I couldn't move them out of the way. Plus, they were more expensive than this one. The only complaint I have about this stool is I wish it was about an inch taller so that my son's feet could rest flat footed on it when he's on the toilet. Otherwise, it's a good little stool.
