 If your looking for a no frills chair this is the one. I didn't find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat. It does recline but I keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old. She seems to like it better that way. The only thing I would complain about is I don't care for the way the belt is. I may be using it incorrectly (at least it seems like that) but it holds the baby (and that's what it's meant for)
