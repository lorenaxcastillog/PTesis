 This item is misleading because it runs VERY small. I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG! I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen. Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help. If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine). It is definately made for taller, longer-torso women (aka 6 ft. models). I would go with another type of support if given another chance
