 I purchased this item myself, and I absolutly LOVE it! The Bundle Me makes it so easy get baby ready to go, instead of having to put a coat on her, etc. I get many compliments on it, and am glad that I spent the extra money on this version, the material is so soft & warm, and it's great quality. Now instead of getting my daughter new coats to fit her, (and to match her wardrobe!) I have the Bundle Me ready to go, already in the carseat! I would definately recommend this item, and would proudly purchase it as a gift for anyone having a baby in the wintertime
