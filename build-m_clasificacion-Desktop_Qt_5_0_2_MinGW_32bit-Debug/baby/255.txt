 I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one.... Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product
