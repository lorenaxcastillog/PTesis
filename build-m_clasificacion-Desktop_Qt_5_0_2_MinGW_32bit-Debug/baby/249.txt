 The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up
