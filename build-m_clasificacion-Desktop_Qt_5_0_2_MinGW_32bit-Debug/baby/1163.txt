 I purchased this toy box for my son's room. The colors are great & they match his decor perfectly. It is very roomy. It holds more toys than I anticipated. The two storage bins underneath are a life saver. I put all of his small toys in them & he can access them easily. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid doesn't stay up that well. It sometimes fall. When he's using his toy box, I just take the lid off to prevent accidents.
