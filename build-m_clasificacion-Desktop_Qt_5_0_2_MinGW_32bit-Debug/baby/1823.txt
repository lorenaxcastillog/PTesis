 I've been using them for 5 years now--the SAME ONES and they're fabulous! They're not hard at all to use (nothing like the doorknob covers--those things are annoying!) and they DO keep my children from touching the knobs, which is what they're for. I've never had a problem with the babies pulling them off or figuring out how to open the stove AND if they go towards the stove at all it gives me that extra split second to deter them that I might not have without them.
