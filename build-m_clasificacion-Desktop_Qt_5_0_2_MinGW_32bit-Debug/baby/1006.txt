 We just got this swing for our 3 1/2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago. Can I tell you she LOVES it!!! She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by. I LOVE the fact that it plugs in! I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO, I don't have batteries. Then while "I" was putting it together I saw that it plugged in....WOOOHOOOO! As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED! I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one, I just couldn't pay $159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price. BUT it would be worth the extra $$...we LOVE it that much! Rache
