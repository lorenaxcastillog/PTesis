 We bought one of these quilted sacks (along with a fleece one and a cotton one) when our daughter was born in the winter. It felt like we were Goldilocks....the fleece kept our baby too warm, the cotton kept her too cold, but the quilted sack was just right. As another reviewer said, the fabric can be a big "clingy", however, it is just a slight annoyance and the benefits far outweigh the irritation. (Besides, I found that the fleece ones are extremely static-y and and cotton sacks wrinkle into a little ball in the dryer.)
