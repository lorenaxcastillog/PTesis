 I tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us. We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent's Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design. These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she's feeding. This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth. She also has reflux. I can't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds. However, I have to think they've helped a bit. They are also comfy to hold for me. I've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking. I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it. So, I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since. They are a bit pricy, but I believe that you get what you pay for. Lastly, I don't think that the small parts are difficult to wash. Yes, it's a bit more time consuming if you don't have a dish washer, but for us, it's been well worth the extra time
