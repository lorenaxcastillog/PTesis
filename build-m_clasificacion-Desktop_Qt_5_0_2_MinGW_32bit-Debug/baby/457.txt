 I purchased this to put on the changing table. I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc. I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one. It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc. I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over. This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby. The price was also reasonable. I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount. This basket is a great buy
