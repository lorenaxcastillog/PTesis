 My 9 month old baby has mild CP. We bought this seat for her when she was younger, but she is just now able to use it. She loves it. It has worked well to help her with her balance, her muscle control and provides a safe environment for her to play. It is limited with the number of activities. Our only complaint is that we have to check the screws on the bottom of the bouncy foot rest, because they often fall out. But we just check it periodically and it hasn't been a problem. I have a few pictures of Hope in her seat in the customer photo section for this seat
