 The crib tent is great! We originally got it to keep our cats out, but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too. :) UNTIL... at 27 months, he learned how to reach through the crib slats & undo the zipper!!!! :-o So now we're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week! It is hard to change sheets with the crib tent, but just get the "ultimate crib sheet" & it's a piece of cake! :) Also, it is *possible* to put down the side rail of the crib, but this does lower the tent too & can bop you in the head. ;
