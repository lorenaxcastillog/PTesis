 The SwaddleMe was bought as a last resort to our little Houdini slipping out of every other swaddling. She was unable to wiggle her way out of this. It's a piece of cake to wrap around baby and easy to just throw in the wash. We bought 2 fleece ones for winter and a lightweight one for spring and summer. She started to get mad at being swaddled around 3 months old, so I wouldn't recommend buying one for an older baby, but our daughter was much calmer and slept better when swaddled while she was younger
