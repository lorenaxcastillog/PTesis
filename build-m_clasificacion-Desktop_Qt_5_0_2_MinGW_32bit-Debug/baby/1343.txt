 We bought this stroller to take on a recent trip to Europe and it was the perfect travel stroller. I did a lot of research on strollers and I was really leaning towards getting a Maclaren, but when we went and actually looked at all the different strollers this one stood out. It's much lighter than the Maclaren and it has a snack tray, which is incredibly useful if your child is old enough to use a sippy cup and nibble on crackers, etc. (We bought this for our then 1.5 year old.) We must have gotten lucky, because I've never had any problems with the wheels like some reviewers have mentioned, and I can steer this with one hand easily. The seat reclines nearly all the way down and the basket underneath was useful for carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags. It does take two hands to close, which is little bit annoying. It's also kind of bulky even when it's closed. The sun visor is too small to do much good, so I wound up throwing my baby sling over it at times to help block the sun for my little guy. (It seemed like every travel stroller we saw had this problem though.) It's very light weight and is easy to carry when it's closed. My husband carried this up and down tube stations all over London (along with a backpack and our five year old at times) and he didn't have any problems. We also traveled to Eastern Europe for a few weeks and this stroller got a serious workout in both the city and the countryside. It held up really well and we're still using it as our second back up stroller. The only bad thing is the sippy cup attachment came off during the flight back and we haven't been able to find a replacement. Also the grown-up cup holder is a complete joke and fell off after only a few uses. Overall though, I'm really pleased with this stroller and would buy it again.
