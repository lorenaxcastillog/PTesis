 I bought this monitor to replace my Sound and Lights monitor because it was picking up the neighbor's house instead of mine. The 10 channels on this monitor make sure that I don't have that problem anymore. The best part about this monitor is that it actually does work outside like it's supposed to. Our old sound and lights was supposed to, but wouldn't even work if you just stepped out onto the porch. This private connection monitor I can take all the way down to the mail box or my husband can set it up in the garage while he's doing projects and the reception is great
