 I have the baby trend sit n stand from one step ahead which is basically the same as this stroller. It has rubber wheels a cup holder and few other changes. I like this stroller but I am not thrilled with the quality. The wheels don't look all that sturdy and the stroller has some play as you turn corners. Since this is our third double stroller (2 used ones before) I think this is the way double strollers are so they don't weigh a ton or cost a fortune. For the price, this is definetly the best double stroller out there. I love the hinged front tray so you can easily get a toddler out. My [...] son loves the sit n stand options and it collapses very easily. Putting the back seat on and taking it off takes a little time but not too difficult. The second sunshade is also a great option during the summer. This stroller is going to be especially wonderful at the zoo and the mall.
