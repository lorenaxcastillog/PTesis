 These slings have been an essential part of being parents. Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on. If at first you don't succeed, try again later. It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage. Another tip, get moving! The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort. Again, baby wearing is such a wonderful thing. I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you. We recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain
