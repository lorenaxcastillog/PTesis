 I discovered this product recently when I had my second baby. I received it as a baby shower gift and I LOVE it. It is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket. I have now bought the large one and my son (3mos) has yet to figure out how to get out of it. The other thing that I like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby's waist or upper chest, leave his arms out, and use it during the day like a blanket. Voila, a blanket that won't fall off when you're holding him, or be kicked off when he's lying down. Kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products.
