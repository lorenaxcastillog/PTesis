 We love this item and people always stop us to ask where we got it! It is a little hard to clean, but I feel better using a reuseable product and taking the effort to wash it than I would if I used disposable plastic placemats. A few wonderful waitstaff folks have willingly cleaned it for us in restaurants. We only use this when we're out. We often wet the suction cups to help them stick. My 18 month old can rip it off, but that tells me he's done eating! The surface is also a bit clingy, so his toddler trick of flinging his arms to scatter food is a little tougher for him! This is a great product and won major daughter-in-law points for me with my germaphobe mother-in -law
