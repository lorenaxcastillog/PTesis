 I got these when I developed cracked and bleeding nipples with my 2nd child. They are the ONLY thing that helped. No amount of lanolin would relieve that initial latch pain. Once I started using these, the pain went away. It was a miracle! I had to use just a couple pairs. They may seem expensive, but you don't have to use a new pair at each feeding like you do with other brands. With my 3rd child, I used these from the start and never got sore. And now with my 4th, I will be sure to have them on hand
