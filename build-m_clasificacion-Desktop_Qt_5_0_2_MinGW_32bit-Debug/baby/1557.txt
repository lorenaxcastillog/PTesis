 I love this set. I looked high and low for neutral, bright nursery bedding and decor and was prepared to spend a lot more money on a set when I stumbled across this in the store. The actual store didn't stock very much of this, but I was able to complete the set on-line and I received it all within 2 days or placing my order. I have the quilt, mobile, hamper, bedskirt, bumper, light plate, wall-hangings, valance, crib sheet, and lamp shade. The quality seems to be excellent and it's so cute. I can't wait to put the entire nursery together with these great decorations.
