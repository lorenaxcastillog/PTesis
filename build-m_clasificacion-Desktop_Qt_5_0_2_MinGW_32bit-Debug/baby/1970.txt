 My son has had this bed for about 4-5 months. He sleeps on it at night and during the day (noon nap). He stands on he bed (now his 14mo sister is in on the act) and the bed is sturdy. none of the problems mentioned by the parents who bought the dora the explorer version. &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; One thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is that it was a pain to put it together correctly and i suspect those who complain about the sturdiness have not put it together like it should be
