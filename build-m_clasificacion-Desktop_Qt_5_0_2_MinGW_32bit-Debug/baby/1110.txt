 This is a very convenient training potty to use and clean. The seat simply lifts off and the inside bowl lifts out to clean. My daughter is only a year old and I worried that it would be a bit big for her (she's also on the small side), but she seems fine on it. She will sit on it for a long time as long as I'm there playing with her. The seat is a pretty soft rubber. We haven't had problems with it sliding, tho she's not big enough to try to get on herself, she has successfully been able to get up by herself without any problems
