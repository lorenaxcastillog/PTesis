 This game is extremely fun. I have played it with multiple groups of different people and the game is requested every time. In fact, the worst thing about this game is that it is addictive! People who are wanting to head home for the party early find themselves staying for "just one more round" over and over. I have also played the non-electronic catch phrase and it is fun as well. It's also cheaper. Either way, this game rocks. It is along the same lines as Taboo, just more fun. I highly recommend this game
