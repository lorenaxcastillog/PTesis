 I started out with various brands of bottles when my baby was born. My baby developed colic at about 5 weeks old. I wanted a bottle that prevented air bubbles as least as possible. The avent bottles were okay, but I tried Dr. Brown's bottles. You see the results immediately! You will see absolutely NO air bubbles going into the nipple or even in the bottle. No other bottle I've seen compares. As a result, my colicky baby has less gas and stomach pain. As far as the extra time to clean the gadgets, oh please, no big deal! It's a matter of an extra minute of your day for a few bottles. It's a little strange at 1st (all the gadgets), but in no time it's no big deal I PROMISE! I will always HIGHLY recommend Dr. Brown's bottles!
