 My babies loved to be swaddled, in fact, they slept best swaddled in the Swaddleme. This blanket was just great, I didn't discover it until they were about 2 months old, so I bought the larger size which we used for a good long while. The velcro is large and never did get worn out. I had one other brand that didn't stay put the way this one did. I used the Swaddleme for many months. I found it nice to use in a sling as well. Highly recommended if you have a baby who loves to be swaddled.
