 This is a great product for big trips or small. Traveling alone with a toddler by plane is not easy with luggage, a stroller and a car seat. This product makes it easier. You have the option to roll it along behind you or carry it on your back freeing up your hands to push a stroller. It may take a little practice to get the car seat in at first but once you've done it it's easier every time. It also holds up to airport luggage handling coming out with a few scrapes but intact and ready to roll along. I also love that it does double duty as a sun shade for the car seat keeping it cool for your little one. I highly recommend it.
