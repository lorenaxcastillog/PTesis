 I have to disagree about the Genie being the best. It's close, but I like the NEAT better. I've owned several of these things (the Dekor, Champ, Genie and NEAT...why so many? All had issues...read on). Frankly, the Dekor and the Champ both smelled (and "smell control" is the reason I want one of these), so those two now serve as garbage pails in other areas of our home. The Genie is good at controlling odor, but the top is a pain to use, and the top on my Genie broke after about 2 months, so another one bites the dust. As for controlling odor, Genie and NEAT are both the best (they both seal off the bad stuff with different "sealing-off" mechanisms that the other models just don't have). And features other reviewers have commented that they like about the Genie are also in the NEAT system: -put a dirty diaper into a clean bag every time -plunge the top to contain the smell and section off the mess - change the bag every few days to a week. (Our 16-month old is in daycare M-F, so we only change our two NEATs once a week. And never a smell. Ever. -easy to replace the liners. Takes 30 seconds. (No smell when changing it, either). Plus... -the handle/plunger on the NEAT is easier to use one-handed than the Genie. Just push and pull. No grappling to get the top off or the bag to grab the diaper and start twisting (with a dirty diaper in one hand and a squirmy baby at the other). -less plastic is wasted because it pushes straight down. The Genie rotates plastic on plastic which sends more down the chute. As you can see, I've dumped a ton of money into this wisdom. But now, I finally have a stink-free environment in my son's room, and so far, nothing on the NEAT has broken (I'm only afraid that because it's an underdog, they're going to discontinue it, and then the refills will be hard to find). - If that happens, I would try another Genie and hope the lid holds out. I rank the Genie #2 out of all of these models
