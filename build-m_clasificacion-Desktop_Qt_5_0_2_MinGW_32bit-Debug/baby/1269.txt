 I have had 4 potty's, this is by far the BEST one. I even bought the Baby Bjorn thinking it would be the best which was wrong. This is the only potty that prevents my son from leaking without a hard deflector to hurt his thighs. I will admit that he really liked his Elmo seat (which had a horrible deflector among other things) so I bought Elmo stickers and stuck them to the very outer edges on the sides and so now he loves this seat as well, sometimes it takes a lot of time waiting for your little one to go and I've noticed that with this seat there are no red marks anywhere on his body from this potty, it is very soft with NO hard seems. And the price is unbelievable.
