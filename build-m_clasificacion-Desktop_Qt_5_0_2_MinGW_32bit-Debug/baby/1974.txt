 I got this for my 15 month old daughter, who within the last month seems to have become very aware of her bodily functions. She has constantly been taking her diaper off, so I figured it was worth a try even though she seems a little young. So far, so good. She sat right up on the toilet with this seat and went pee-pee within 3 minutes. She was very excited to throw her used Kandoo in the toilet and flush. I clapped and said, "Yea!" This seat is great because it is easily removable, has handles for little ones with busy hands, and a splash guard for when this little one gets a little to much momentum behind her pee-pee. I think this is a much better and sanitary option than one of those potty training units. Why try and separate a little kid from that later on when they can start off right on the toilet? And, why possibly put yourself through the hassle of cleaning those things, GROSS
