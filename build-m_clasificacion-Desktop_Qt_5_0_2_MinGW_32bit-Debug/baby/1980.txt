 As I write this, this car seat is not available at Amazon, but I wanted to give it a review in case they get it in stock again. I bought this for my son who out grew his infant carseat when he was 5 months old. I wasn't ready to switch him to his "big boy" carseat yet because I like the fact that I can take him out of the car without waking him up. This seat is great because it goes up to 30lbs and 32 iches, but the seat itself is HEAVY. Also, as many reviewers have said, the fabric is not breathable and my son sweats like crazy in it. The canopy is nice and big, but it falls down the back when not in use and can be a nuisance. I ended up taking it off after 2 months. All in all we love the seat, it just needs different fabric and something to stop the canopy from falling down the back
