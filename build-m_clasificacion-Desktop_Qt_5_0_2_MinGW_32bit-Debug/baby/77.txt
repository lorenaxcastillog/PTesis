 This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, "Sorry, you are out of warranty" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller
