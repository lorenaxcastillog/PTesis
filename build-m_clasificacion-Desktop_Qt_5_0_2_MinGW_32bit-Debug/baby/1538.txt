 I initially tried the Avent wide-neck bottles for my newborn and didn't like them. Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them. You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal). The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk. My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles. My son doesn't have reflux but I can't imagine using any other bottle for him. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy agai
