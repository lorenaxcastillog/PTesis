 The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs. my daughter is only 27lbs. and it could not hold her. While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not. After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier. I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs. I love it. Also, the cross terrain claim to " Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent's shoulder and onto hips" it does not. I was in horrible pain after about an hour. in both my upper and lower back. I suggest you don't waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and Kelty. This will work for a smaller child, but only if you can compfortably carry the weight. I did like the easily adjustable seat and back. I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands.
