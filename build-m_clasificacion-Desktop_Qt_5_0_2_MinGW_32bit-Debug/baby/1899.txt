 I bought this for my son a couple of years ago. We used it lots when we were out, especially when he was potty training and just couldn't wait. It's wonderful. Just wish it was easier to find the liners. Another reviewer said there are sharp edges. Ours doesn't have any sharp edges. It does collapse, if the legs aren't snapped up properly; but otherwise isn't a problem. Our daughter is potty training right now and we have it ready for her whenever she needs it. It will also be great for our upcoming car trip
