 CONS *WON'T STAY IN PLACE I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck. *WHY A REMOTE? Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride? *THE IRRITATING SONG too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting) *LEARN WHAT? I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car... PROS *Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained..
