 My son, who was used to using a wood stool (8" tall with slick wood feet) fell climbing up on this because the top (foot area) is too small and it tipped on him! It's only 6" wide on top. Not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on. If you push it in toward the toilet there is NOTHING left for the child to stand on. If you leave it out, then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste. Getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top. His feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet - not coming near the top of this 8 1/2" tall stool. This is advertised as being 10" tall (actually 8 1/2") 14" long (correct, but top surface is only 11 1/2") and 10" wide (also correct but again, it is only 6" wide on top) The rubber feet are great for non-skid purposes, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this.
