 We purchased this table when our daughter was 18 months old. It is the best table out there, it is very sturdy and she learned to get in and out of it very easily which was a plus over tables with separate chairs. Our daughter is now 2+ yrs old and we still use it every day. We use it to draw and paint, take it outside to our garden and bring it back in, nothing seems to damage it, my husband and I even sit on it sideways. I love the fact that it folds nicely for storage. This table has been a hit with our daughter's little friends too, when they come over several kids will sit together and eat and I've even taken it to the park for picnics. BEST BUY!!! We expect to be using it for at least another 2 years or more. Even our 5 year old nephews want to eat breakfast in it whenever they stay over!
