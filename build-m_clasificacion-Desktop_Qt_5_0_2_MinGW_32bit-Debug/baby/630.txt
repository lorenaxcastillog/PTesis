 I purchased this sling from ebay for $8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it, we did just that. It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product, and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it, I now COMFORTABLY, have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure. I am petite and this is one size fits all, you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter. If you have problems with the baby being secure, you just need to pull up the material high on the back (theirs and yours) AND tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand. I am now VERY impressed with this product, a little knowledge goes a long way! The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php ~ once you see how to use this product correctly, you WILL LOVE IT! :o) I do now
