 I have lived in cold climates for each of my kids, and have hated the dreaded bundle up and squeeze into the carseat routine. It makes traveling so much easier now that I can leave baby without a big bunting and know she'll be warm and cozy. The zippers are great - almost 6 months of use every single day and not a problem. I have washed it several times and it looks like new and has held up wonderfully. I have used it on windy days, when I was a bit sceptical about it being windproof, and it stood the test. Moving it from the carseat to the stroller is a sinch with the velcro closures in the back. I don't have any cons to list this has been such a great item for us
