 This is a WONDERFUL car seat. (I purchased it in the Cobblestone design) It's wonderfully made convertible car seat, and a much better value as the higher-priced alternative car seats. We had a Britax before purchasing this one, and I think I'll definitely stick with Evenflo! This is one the best-rated car seats, and less than HALF the price of Britax! It's super sturdy, great safety features, everything you'd want in a great car seat. It is a little bigger than I expected, and had trouble getting it in my car, but we used to have an infant car seat so I didn't keep that in mind that it'd be bigger because the baby's bigger! Also, for first-time parents, I would DEFINITELY recommend getting a convertible car seat instead of an infant car seat. Infant car seats are only a maximum of 22 lbs, and the baby will usually reach that by about 7 months! I paid $200 for the infant seat, and hardly got any use out of it! And convertible ones will go until the child reaches 40 lbs. A MUCH smarter and more economical choice.
