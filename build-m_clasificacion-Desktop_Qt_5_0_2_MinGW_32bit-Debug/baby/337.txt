 My daughter really LOVES this BUS. Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it. She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them. The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up. My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm. But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since.
