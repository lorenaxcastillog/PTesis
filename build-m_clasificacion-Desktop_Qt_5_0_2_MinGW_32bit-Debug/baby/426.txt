 Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward, loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat. Since this happened he's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place...just by loosening the harness.Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product. I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this. Not very happy
