 Now that I've caved to the power of pink (it only took three girls for me to finally give in), this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest I could find. Quality seems fine (two weeks post purchase) and who doesn't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood...? For the first babe, we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat, but had so many functions it was basically useless. This is a case, though, where the basics are the best. In looking around for a new one, saw many for $100; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic, this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months, anyway
