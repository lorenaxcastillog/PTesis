 I didn't realize the tentacles were horns when I purchased it-- I thought they were electric touch-sensors. I like the horns much more since batteries are not required and I know it will not break easily. My 4-month old son cannot squeeze the tentacles to make the noises (yet) but I'm having so much fun playing it for him! He loves the different textures and colors of the fabrics. I've already purchased two more for friends... this toy is a bargain at $10! It's definitely worth much more.
