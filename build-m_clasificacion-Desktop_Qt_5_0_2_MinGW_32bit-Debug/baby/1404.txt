 My son is 3 and a half and we started potty training two months before he turned 3. We had purchased the cheaper seats at Target and Walmart, but he would still have #2 accidents. Our toilet is very elongated and all the other seats didn't fit well and were very wobbly. We just recently bought the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer and now he is excited about going #2.... It is very secure because of the adjusting dial and he can get on the potty all by himself. No more accidents after a week with this seat! The high front prevents #1 spillage and the contor shape holds him well. I wish that I had known about this seat 8 months ago. I very highly reccomend this seat
