 I bought this item because the FAQ on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib, including ones with solid headboards. However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard. Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following: "The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it." When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told: "The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire." I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same. Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ, however, I now am inconvenience with returning the item. I am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product.
