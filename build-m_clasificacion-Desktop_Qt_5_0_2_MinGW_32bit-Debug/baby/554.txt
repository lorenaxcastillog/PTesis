 Used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt. Purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here. I liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions. While using the wrap isn't intuitive (ie watch the dvd) it's easy to learn. My back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap (tummy to tummy) than in traditional front carriers. I wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise. Only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so I have to hold baby's head while I rock her to sleep. Would recommend this product, great price too
