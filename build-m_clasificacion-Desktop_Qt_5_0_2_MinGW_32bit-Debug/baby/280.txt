 We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years. With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology. Oops. It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor. And the annoying beeping was the clincher. I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear. Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..
