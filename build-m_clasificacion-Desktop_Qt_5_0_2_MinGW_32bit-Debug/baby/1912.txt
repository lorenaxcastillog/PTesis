 Had a Graco high chair on my registry list and received this instead from Mom because it was pink and she just had to buy pink! Very easy to put together especially at 8 1/2 months pregnant. I love that it reclines and the height is adjustable. It's on wheels which makes it easy to manuever throughout the house and it folds up very easily which makes it easy to store out of the way while not in use. Everything seems to be great about this chair. Our daughter won't be using it for a few months since she isn't even here yet but I'm sure she'll love it as much as I do already
