 Love it, no complaints!!! I have a 2 1/2 year old son and six month old daughter. We graciously accepted my sister's hand me down Evenflo 'Take me Two' double stroller before the arrival of my daughter. Not only was that ridiculously hard to move (it weighs 47lbs), but my son (weighing 35 lbs) would throw a 2 year year old fit and end up kicking the back seat of his sister's chair and send her flying forward. My children are both super tall and heavy. After loading them into my suv, loading the stroller was like a joke! After some extensive research, my Joovy arrived two days ago and have used it on a crazy expedition to Walmart (one week before Christmas, mind you!). My 2 year old is extremely picky and he hopped right in, and rode the whole time. He felt he was a 'big boy' and my daughter rested happily in the universal car seat attachement bar. She is also big enough to just sit up, so that is what I will try next. Both kids were comfy, content, and safe. It glides with ease, is a BREEZE to open and close (lift up two small levers with your fingers and it collapses). The construction is obviously very sturdy and high quality. And, it only weighs 24 lbs, yeah!!! LOVE IT, so glad I bought it, it will be a life saver. Thank you Joovy
