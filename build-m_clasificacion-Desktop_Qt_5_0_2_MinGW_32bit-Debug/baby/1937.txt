 My son was huge at birth and around 2 months started to get fussy in the evenings. I discovered that swaddling helped but had a hard time finding a blanket big enough. The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket was perfect. Unlike some of the other swaddling products that can only be used to swaddled it's actually a functioning blanket as well. Now we don't swaddle him any more but we still use the Ultimate Swaddling Blanket to cover him up. It's the perfect weight for covering him up without him getting too hot.
