 I am not sure at what point I had read that these mats are not a good thing... Heard they prevent the seat belt tensioner from working properly. But did a lot of research about the Grip It and also it was recommended at a local baby store that is highly regarded. We installed our car seat base and had more than the allowed 1 inch of movement, so the store recommended this - it did eliminate the movement. As far preventing seat damage, that wasn't one of our goals (though that is often one of the pitch lines for these items)
