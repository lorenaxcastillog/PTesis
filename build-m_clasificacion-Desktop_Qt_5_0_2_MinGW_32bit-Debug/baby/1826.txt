 With 2 little kids in a stroller, I depend heavily on these hooks to help me carry all the gear I have, especially when traveling or shopping. The diaper bag and coats fit into the strollers basket, but I've used the hooks to carry an additional beach bag to the beach or pool, as well as shopping bags. I've also used them to hold my purse and camera bag. They really increase the holding capacity of the stroller. I wish they were more widely available! Unfortunately, they can be hard to find in stores and on the web
