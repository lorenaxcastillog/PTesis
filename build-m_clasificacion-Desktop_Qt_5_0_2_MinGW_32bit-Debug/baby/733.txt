 We have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights, as well as on many car trips at home and abroad. It is great! It is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars. On some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom, but the cushioning is adequate, my son has never complained. He seems very comfortable in it. "Baby Bargains" recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby, and I am online ordering one for my daughter right now. If you expect to travel, this seat is an essential. It is light enough that lugging it around airports, cruiseships and such is not a total pain (although as with any seat, it is nice to have a bag, we've done it both with and without)
