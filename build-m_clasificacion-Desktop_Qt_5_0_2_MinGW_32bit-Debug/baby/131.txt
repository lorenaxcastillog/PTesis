 I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better
