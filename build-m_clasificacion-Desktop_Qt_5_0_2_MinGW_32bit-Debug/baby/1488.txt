 I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works. Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things. She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read "the potty book for girls" She was immediately sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away. We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself. It is very basic and sturdy. My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front. I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the "big" potty
