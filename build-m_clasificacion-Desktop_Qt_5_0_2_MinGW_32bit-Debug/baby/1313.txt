 This past November I purchased a Bundle Me Pink. Starting in October I would put a blanket over my child in the car seat to keep her warm as we live in the Midwest climate. When there was a little bit of wind it seemed hard to keep it in place. I then decided to buy a Bundle Me Pink. No need to put heavy clothes on or a big coat or even a snow suit! This is one of the BEST purchases I have made for our child. It is so easy to install in your baby's car seat too. I plan to buy the light weight version and the toddler one when our child gets of age. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a baby who lives in the cooler climates.
