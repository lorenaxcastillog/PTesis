 I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first. My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor. It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller. The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm. I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off
