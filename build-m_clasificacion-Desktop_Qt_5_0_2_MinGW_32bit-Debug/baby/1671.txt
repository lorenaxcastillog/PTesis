 I have twin girls (8 months old) and once they learned to sit up they no longer wanted to lay back in the original tub I bought them. I tried to fix it so that they could sit up, but it was complicated, and they were just not comfortable. I bought the Snug Tub Jr. so that they could have a place to sit and enjoy bath time safely. Even better... I bought two of the snug tubs and they both fit in our standard tub. They sit up, face each other and the inflated sides make me feel comfortable that they won't hit their heads. The only bad thing I have to say is that it is a little hard to close the plastic stopper. But overall, we LOVE it
