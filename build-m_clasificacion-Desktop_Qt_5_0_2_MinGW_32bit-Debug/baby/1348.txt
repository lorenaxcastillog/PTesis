 I needed a gate for an odd sized doorway and looked at all of them at least twice. This gate was a great bargain with the extensions included(which is expensive to buy separately with the other gates). I have found it to be very sturdy with no movement or realignment when it closes. I didn't want to use hardware to install it and have never had a problem with the bar on the bottom. I installed it with my 9 month old tugging and climbing on me with no problems. It has a good appearance and is easy to operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries). I have received many good comments by visitors and I am very glad I picked this one.
