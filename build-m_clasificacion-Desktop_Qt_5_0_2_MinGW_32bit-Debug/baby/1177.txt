 I had to buy this baby wrap through e-bay because amazon would not ship outside the US. My baby loves it, we flew from Dublin to London both ways and you would not have know that there was a baby on the flight, because she slept through the whole journey. She just loves it, she falls asleep everytime I put her in it. She is just over 2 months old and weighs nearly 11 pounds. It's so comfortable, I actually went on a 1 mile walk with her the other day and did not feel the strain on my shoulders. I tried the other baby carriers, the regular ones and that was like hell, luckily I had only borrowed it and had not bought one, it dug into my shoulders and left me aching for a day. The wrap is soft, it keeps the baby warm in the winter and cool in the summer as it's made out of cotton and lycra. Most importantly it's comfortable to wear for both Mum/Dad and Baby. Highly recommended! I usually don't write reviews but I just had to mention something about the wrap because I'm absolutely over the moon with it. By the way it's really easy to put on, it only took me a couple of minutes to get the hang of it
