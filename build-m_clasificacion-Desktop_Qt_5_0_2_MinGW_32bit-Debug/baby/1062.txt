 I saw this item on a relative's registry and decided to buy one when I was getting ready for our second child. I thought it would be a good way for our three year old to "admire" the new baby without having to hold him all the time. It works great for that- but even better for keeping our baby asleep! He is a spitter, and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks. A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings. This serves that purpose perfectly. It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up! Only word of warning- make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping. Our son managed to wriggle over the side a bit.
