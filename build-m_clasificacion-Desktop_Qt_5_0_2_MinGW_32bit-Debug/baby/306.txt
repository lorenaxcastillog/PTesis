 I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags. After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off. I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half. I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First. They only had the blue top without the spring. The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top
