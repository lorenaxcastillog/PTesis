 When we had our kids, this mirror was really great for giving the rear-facing child seat occupant (that would be our boys) a view of the driver and the driver a view of their faces. Soon enough they outgrew the seating layout and the mirror got stowed in the door pocket. It was great for the kids and us and we really got a lot of use out of it. But wait, we weren't done with it yet! When I got my Jeep, I happened to come across the little mirror again and decided to try it for a blind spot mirror. I never liked those little circular ones that go on the side mirrors because they take up too much room and they're so small they aren't really very useful. Instead I stuck this mirror up on the left corner of my windshield where the only thing it blocked is low flying aircraft. And it provides a rear-view that covers my blind spot perfectly and is large enough to actually see what's going on. The added bonus is that because it's inside, it never gets wet, icy or fogged up. It's been on my windshield ever since. The kids are 7 and 9 now so that little mirror is almost a decade old and it still sticks to the window and has survived several bumps and never broke! Not bad for a few bucks
