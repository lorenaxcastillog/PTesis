 I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we're out strolling in the sun. It does a pretty good job; only my son's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined (my only beef about the product), but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem. I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable. I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached. I think the side pouches are an excellent plus. I am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family
