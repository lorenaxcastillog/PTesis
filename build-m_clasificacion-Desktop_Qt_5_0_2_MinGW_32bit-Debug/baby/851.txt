 The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you, it was the best choice ever. I have no real experience with any other wipes, but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color...THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE. I love that I just put the whole pack in, plastic and all, and it stays nice and toasty for my son's bottom. He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore. I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top. I love that it heats from the top. The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist. I also love the little handle on the top, so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be! The product is hight recommended
