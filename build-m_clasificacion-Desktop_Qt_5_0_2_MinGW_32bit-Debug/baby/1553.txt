 Love this bag and so does my girlfriend who wanted to steal mine at first. It fits most of the essentials to go out for the day to the mall or to run errands. It even fits my wideneck bottles and wallet. There is not enough room for change of clothes, changing pad, or toys but that's what the bottom of the stroller is for. It is very comfortable to wear even over a jacket and does not hurt your back to carry it. And it's never in the way of maneuvering your way through the aisles.
