 I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts. I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs. Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts. Oh well. Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed. I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car. I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way, but it didn't matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form. A great baby shower gift
