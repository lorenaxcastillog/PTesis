 the bumper is useful in that in prevents our son from getting his arms and legs through the crib slats on a regular basis while providing a breathable barrier in case he rolls over with his face against the bumper. my only complaint is that it slides down fairly easily, especially when baby gets his leg on top of it (while laying on his side, not standing) or grabs it. it needs to be readjusted and tightened frequently. nevertheless, we sleep better knowing he doesn't have his face in a thick quilted bumper. and it is really beathable- i put my own nose and mouth to it before installation to check
