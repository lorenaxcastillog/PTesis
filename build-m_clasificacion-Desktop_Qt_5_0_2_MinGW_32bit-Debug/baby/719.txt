 I have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity. At first, I was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok. So I took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby, ... it stopped ticking. The baby was not moving, but just it's heart and/or lungs working keeps the unit ticking. It detects even when you blow on the sensor. Maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity, since ceiling fans, etc might activate it, but I was truly amazed with the sensitivity. You can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome, it is like a clock ticking, about once a second when baby is ok, if it stops ticking for about 30 seconds.. a noticeable alarm will ring.
