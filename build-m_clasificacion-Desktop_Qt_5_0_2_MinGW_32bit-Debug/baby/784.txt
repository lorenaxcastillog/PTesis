 We have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old, and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room. We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across. It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours. If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult. Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability. As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it. The extra foot adds stability. The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds. We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs. As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things. We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company. I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong. I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace
