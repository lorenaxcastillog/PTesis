 Well, I don't have any children nor do I plan on changing that, however, I bought this Moby Wrap for my best friend for a baby shower gift and she was absolutely thrilled. She told me it's very ergonomically designed and comfortable for both mother and baby. She's been coveting one since the birth of her first child (she's pregnant with #2 now). She also told me that if you are creative there's all sorts of different ways you can wrap the dealy to attach your child to yourself, so that should be fun. The Moby wrap comes with a little packet detailing different adventures in child wrapping. I'm very happy I purchased this for a gift
