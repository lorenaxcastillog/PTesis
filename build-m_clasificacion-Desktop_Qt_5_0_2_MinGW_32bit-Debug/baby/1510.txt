 My husband and I bought this because our baby was born right before we would be moving back to the US. We are very happy with it as it makes traveling with a baby a breeze. We never have to worry if the hotel we're in provides cribs, or if they are safe for that matter. We have had it for almost three months now, using it exclusivly, and the only thing wrong is a small tear in the fabric. I had no trouble setting this up, however I did try it out before the baby came so I wasn't exhausted at the time. I don't think it would have gone the same if I was. I can't imagine what we would have done without this thing
