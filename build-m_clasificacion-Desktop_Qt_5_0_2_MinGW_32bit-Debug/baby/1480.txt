 Bed is great. Took a while to put together but have had absolutely no problems with it. My wife who weights about 125 lbs has laid on this bed and it has not even come close to falling apart. It states max weight should be 50 lbs but it appears to handle more than double. My daughter loves it and I recommend it if you dont mind the time it takes to put together. Sure it was a bit tricky but I believe the way the poles are made is for it to have more support. Loved the fact I could use the mattress from her crib.
