 This sterilizer is wonderful! As a first time mother, I'm still figuring out things. But I realized this is one of those things I truly did need. It is so easy to use and does save a lot of time. I am not a germ freak, but I like to know that the bottles I am traveling with are clean and sterile. My baby is almost 6 months old and I have used it with Dr. Brown's bottles, Medela breast pump parts, and any other baby parts that would fit into it.
