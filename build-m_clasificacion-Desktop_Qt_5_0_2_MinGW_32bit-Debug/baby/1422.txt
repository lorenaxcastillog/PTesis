 We purchased this in desparation because our son has a lot of colic outbursts and we hoped previous reports were correct. Although it doesn't always work to calm him, it helps 2 out of 5 times which is better than before, and he even falls asleep in it occasionally - something he only previously did in our arms. So we have had it for 2 months and as long as i put on some of the white noise, in his non-fussy modes, he generally will go to sleep for about 1/2 hour! There are 2 things i would change - 1. the straps are a pain to work, and with a newborn they aren't really necessary since he doesn't yet move much. i always put a blanket on the fully reclined seat to soften the feel of the straps on his back (i don't use them yet). 2. The white pastic bar is a pain to use, it takes a lot to snap it down and unhook it when he is crying, so i just took it off (which took some work after installing it). now i can grab him easily when he wakes up fussy. all in all i am very please with it - he loves looking at the hanging animals over his head and the sounds work magic.
