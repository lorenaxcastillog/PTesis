 I wish more people knew about this storage system. It is so convenient - pump straight into the liners, twist on the caps, and store in the fridge or freezer. Once the milk has frozen, pop off the caps, pop out the liners and store them in freezer bags. When needed, just pop a liner back into a nurser and it's ready to go. The bottles heat quickly and easily in hot water. It's so easy to clean the pieces - just soak in hot soapy water for a minute and rinse. I bought 4 or 5 storage systems - I can bring 4 caps to work, send 4 bottles to daycare, and have several bottles stored in the fridge or freezer. My son, almost 5 months old, has had no problems bottle-feeding with the Playtex nursers and the NaturaLatch slow flow nipples. Highly recommend!!
