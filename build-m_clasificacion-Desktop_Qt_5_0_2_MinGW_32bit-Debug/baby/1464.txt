 I finally picked up the jogging stroller now that my boy is 17 months old. It was easy to put together and is very quiet. Since its brand new there hasn't been time for it to get squeeky! My only complaint was that it seemed to lean to the right until I walked with it for about a mile. Then it corrected itself and I think it is nice. The other thing was the left back tire rubbed one time on the break that sits up above when unlocked. But that could have been some uneven ground. I have the Sport model that doesn't come with the MP3 thing I think. I'll just listen to the birds and ambient sounds instead.
