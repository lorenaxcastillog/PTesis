 I think these are awesome! A must have for Newborns! I just had my 5th child and wish I had found these earlier! I didn't use this for long, about the first month. But it made things so much easier that I think it was worth every penny! One thing I really like is you can keep the top closed holding their arms in close while you change their diapers. They seem to not mind their diapers changed as much this way. They are also nice because they stay tightly swaddled unlike recieving blankets that loosen and move around
