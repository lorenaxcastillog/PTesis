 I bought these sheets because of other reviews stating the thinner sheets were horrible. These on the other hand are nice and soft. I washed and dried these sheets (because I didn't read the instructions) and after reading a few comments that the sheets don't fit after drying decided to break them out to try them for myself. Since our baby isn't due for another 6 weeks I didn't have these things out yet (because the cat would think I set it up for him). Well, I only took out the "mattress" if you will. And proceeded to try an put both sheets (just to make sure) on. It is a tight fit but I also figured it would be since bunching around a baby's face is not something I would have wanted anyways. Well the sheets do fit (at least with the "mattress" out on my bed rather than in the travel crib itself. But it probably would be easier to make it that way anyway. Hope this helps
