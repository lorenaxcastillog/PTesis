 I have never been so excited about a new gadget. Put it together in ten minutes with the assitance of my very excited toddler. I was getting very impatient waiting for this stroller to come on the market, but couldn't be more pleased that I did. I had researched them all and was going to buy it sight unseen, which made me nervous. Went to a local retailer yesterday and after an instore test drive with my almost 3yr old and my 3 month old bought it immediately. I can't say enough great things about this stroller. Especially as a mom of toddler and infant. It handles like a dream all the bells and whistles are fabulous. Folds like a piece of cake. Which I can't say about my perego. The basket drops down so you can access it without changing the rear seat position. My 3yr old thinks it is the coolest thing ever and she loves the fact that her baby sister is right behind her. Yes it is a little heavy, but I am a small woman and can manage just fine. After all my oldest weighs 28lbs. It is a little longer in person than in the photos - (no big deal) We all went for our first family stroll after dinner last night it was amazing. Handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need to prop up the srtoller to get over a bump. So STURDY - feel like both my girls are snug and safe. Love that the five point harness is attached to the seat, unlike the perego. Really if you have to children (particularly a baby and toddler) this is the way to go!!
