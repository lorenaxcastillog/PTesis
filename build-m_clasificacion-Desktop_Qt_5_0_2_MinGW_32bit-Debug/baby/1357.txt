 I got this for my 2 year old and it'll keep her busy for a good while. She loves coloring, LOVES IT! The only problem I have with this is that she won't keep the crayons in their little holders and the crayons break easy. Which is what crayons are wont to do in little hands. I think Crayola would have been better served making these a bit thicker for tiny yet strong hands. The same way they have those super big crayons for pre-school. Another thing, you may consider just getting the bath crayons. The board is cute, but Lydia prefers a bigger canvas and only used the board for a few moments before moving onto the great big tub and tile. Don't fool yourself, they're going to color on the tile. (; Wipes away easy enough though! If you go to Babies R Us, you will find Baby Einstein crayons for $3.99. A nice replacement with the same sleeves included. Colors include Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black and Orange. ETA: The easiest way I've found to clean the tub after a couple of sessions of crayon play it to spray the surfaces with Scrubbing Bubbles, let it sit for a few moments, and wipe away. There is a bit more elbow work required otherwise
