 We recently purchased our first new car ever! We wanted to make sure that our car seat does not put indentations into our new car's interior so we purchased this seat saver. It has been easy to use and so far it is saving our car's seat. Our daughter is in a rear-facing car seat and my my only complaint is that the bottom of the seat saver is much larger than the base of our car seat. However, I think that as our daughter grows, so will her car seat and this will eventually become a nice feature to have
