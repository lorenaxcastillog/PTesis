 My baby was small (4 pounds 14 ounces) when born and was not able to nurse well. I established my supply on a rental Symphony from the hospital. When it came time to return the Symphony I debated whether to continue renting it or to purchase my own pump. The purchase price of pumps really scared me off, but I considered the Swing because it is intended for daily use, which is what I needed, but was not as pricey as the Pump In Style. I LOVE THE SWING. THe Swing is as efficient, if not more, as the SYmphony. THe fact that it is a single pump does not bother me at all because it is so efficient I am done pumping in 20 minutes - both sides. It is so lightweight and portable that you can go anywhere. After a month of being tied to the huge Symphony every three hours, it was a wonderful and welcome change to be able to go places with the pump. I am a full time working mom and currently use the Swing every day. I fully recommend this
