 I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well. As I am large and this pack fits me, I would think this would ajust to a small person well. I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back. I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems. The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed. The pack is very comfortable for both of us. The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack. I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out, but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price. I highly recommend this pack.
