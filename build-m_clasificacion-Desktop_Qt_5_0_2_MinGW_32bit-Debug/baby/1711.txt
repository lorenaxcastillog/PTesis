 I use this pump all the time- for 95% of my baby's feedings. I actually have 2 of them. I keep one in the car with a clean bottle at all times and one in the house. The pump is easy to clean, and comes with spare parts. This manual pump is comfortable to use. I know that all of the experts recommend electric pumps, but I have done just fine using this manual pump and saved a ton of money over the electric pumps. The Avent bottles fit directly only this pump, so it's quick and simple to take the full bottle off the pump and either freeze it with a sealing disc, feed your baby by putting on a nipple top, or store it in the fridge with a nipple top & storage cap. I must note however that 1 of my pumps is the older version of this model and the other is the newest version. The newest and current version leaks a little where the screw on grooves from the pump meet the bottle, as the older version with a different part did not. So, just be a bit careful when using this otherwise you'll have drops of milk on your clothes
