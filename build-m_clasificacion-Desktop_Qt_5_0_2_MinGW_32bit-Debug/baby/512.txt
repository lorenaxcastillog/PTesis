 I purchased the extention kit for the Superyard XT Play Gate to go with the Play Gate that I purchased. It works great for my new Pomeranian Puppies. The Play Yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe. It will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves. The fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so I can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be. I love this item and I am very happy I purchased it. I feel the gate is great for animals, I have not used it with Children as of this time
