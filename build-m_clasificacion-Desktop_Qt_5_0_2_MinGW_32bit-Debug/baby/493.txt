 I found one of these at a yard sale ... and it didn't have the suction cup portion. So, I have no idea if it's a good high chair toy. However, the toy part gets 5 stars from my daughter! She has been fascinated by this toy since she was 3 months old. Now, she is 5 months, and she chooses this toy over all others. It is her favorite to chew on, bang around, grab, and study. The black and white handle (that goes into the suction cup) is very easy for her to hold. She can grasp it with both hands and bring it to her mouth. The mirror/smiley face ball is fun to watch. The rattle and noises it makes are fun, but not annoying
