 My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills. Well, it did not control odor. The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week. The odor escaped even when the pail was closed. You do save money on refills at first. But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often. I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink. Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things. I would not recommend this product
