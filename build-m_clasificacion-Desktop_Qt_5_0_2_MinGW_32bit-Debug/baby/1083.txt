 My husband and I battled between this bed and the nascar bed. I won of course and we ended up with this one. So far we are very happy with it. We bought it for our 22 month old son, who loves it. He stays in it at nap and bedtime, and plays on it during the day. My biggest frustration was putting the bed together. The very first step took us over two hours, plus we ended up having to run back to the store and switch one of the side rails out with the display model because it wasn't fitting together right. The second peice didnt fit much better and it even after we got it locked in to place the screw didn't line up. After that step asswmbly went really quick. It looks darling though and our son loves it which was all we were really hoping for. Stephanie Salt lake City, Ut
