 I ordered this pattern for a friend of mine who is having a baby shower the end of september. I had no problem receiving my merchandise and I love the quality and the colors of this item. I bought her the comforter, the bed ruffle, and the bumper and target was right on target delivering it to my home. This is the first time I have ordered oline from target and I am very happy with the shipping of my 3 items (that came all at the same time within 3 days) and the quality of this item. Thank you target! Sincerely, ROBIN C
