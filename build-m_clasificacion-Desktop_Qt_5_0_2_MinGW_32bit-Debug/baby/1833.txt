 We started out with a Baby Bjorn after my son was born that a relative gave us. It was fine for the first few months but, once he hit 17 lbs the shoulder pain was just out of control. We did a bunch of research online and found lots of positive reviews for the Ellaroo Mei Hip. I ordered it and have truly never looked back. It is so incredibly comfortable, even now when he is far heavier. (He is nearly a year old now.) All of the weight is down on my hip and I regularly walk the 3 mile path around the lake by my house with him on my hip with very little effort and no pain. It also packs so small & light that it is really easy to keep in the diaper bag and pull out whenever we get somewhere in the car. A great product
