 I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!
