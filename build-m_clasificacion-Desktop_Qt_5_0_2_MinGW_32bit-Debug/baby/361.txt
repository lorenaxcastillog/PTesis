 I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor
