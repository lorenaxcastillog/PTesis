 We have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment. When our 2nd child was born, we put him in our bedroom. There is not much space there, so this portable crib was a great find! We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it. Pros: saves space, folds, easy to move from room to room (on wheels), really easy to change the sheets (compared to regular crib with heavy matress). It also has very neutral color and style, so it fits really well with other traditional furniture. Cons: the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year, the matress is extremely thin (about 1 inch!). We bought an extra matress (the normal thickness) for about $20. To find it, do a search for "portable crib matress"
