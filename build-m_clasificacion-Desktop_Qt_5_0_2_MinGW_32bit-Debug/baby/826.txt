 In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there. It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand! With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it. Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart. Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease! On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!! I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly. eek. Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat. Finally adjusted, that product (the "Shop'n'Dine") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop. Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices: the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.
