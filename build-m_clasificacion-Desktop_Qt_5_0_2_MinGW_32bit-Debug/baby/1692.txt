 I absolutely LOVE this pump. It is fast and effective and I get way more milk with this pump than I did with any other that I tried. Also-- these things are expensive so shop around so you don't overpay. I got mine from a private practice LC at Add A Little Love.com and got not only the pump at a great price, but the owner helped me with the issues I was having. Bottom line - the pump is great but only if you have someone to help and support you too
