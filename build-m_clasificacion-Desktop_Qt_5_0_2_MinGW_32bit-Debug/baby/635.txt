 We love it! Yes, the volume is low, but there's a very simple solution to that -- put it near your head. The best things about this device are the AC adapter and the fact that it will run all night. I just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time (Our cat must think we live by the ocean now!) A couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds. If this happens to you, turn it over and flip the switch off of DEMO mode -- it has the 5-second setting so you can try it out in the store. We're hooked on this thing now. I may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room.
