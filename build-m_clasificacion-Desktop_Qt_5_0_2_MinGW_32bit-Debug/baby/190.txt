 I used these pads when I first started nursing. They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes. However, my nipples were incredibly sore. When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed. WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms. Don't use these. Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)
