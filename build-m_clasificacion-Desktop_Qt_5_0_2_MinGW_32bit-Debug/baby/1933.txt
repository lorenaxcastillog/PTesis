 I've been using this bathseat for about 4 months now, since my daughter was about 6 months old. She loves being able to kick and splash while sitting in it. I originally had this same type bathseat for my son, minus the little elbow rest, but when trying to purchase the same one 7 years later I see that it is no longer available. The great thing about the other one was that when putting your child into it, the front would rise up and snap shut. With the Safety 1st Tubside Bathseat, you have to slide your kid into it. Also, be very careful if you have a "climber". My daughter loves to try standing in it. Fortunately, the elbow rest makes it secure, so there are no fears of the seat tipping over, just your little standing monkey. You will still have to remove your child in order to wash their little bottoms
