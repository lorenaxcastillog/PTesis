 When my third child was born, we got this tub. It has been the best yet for us. From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly. As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached. We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage. Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub. A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath. This is the position in which we currently use our tub. Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands. Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time. No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead
