 This Bundleme Wasabi is wonderful!! It is so convenient, I would not want to be without it for any baby. The inside of it is very soft and comfortable. It keeps my 6 month old daughter toasty warm which is much needed here in Chicago. I like it so much more than having to put on her bulky coat everywhere we go. I just lay her in this, slip on a hat, zip up the Wasabi and go! I highly recommend this if you live somewhere where the temps go below the 30s
