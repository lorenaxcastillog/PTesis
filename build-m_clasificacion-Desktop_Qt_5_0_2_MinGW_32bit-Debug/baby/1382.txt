 I got this for my daughter, who is very big for her age, and grew out of her infant tub at 6 months. She can sit up well, but I worried about her falling/slipping and hitting her head. This product is easy to use and works very well! The instructions tell you to make sure your tub is CLEAN and DRY, and you MUST follow these instructions if you want the suction cups to hold! BONUS--It covers up the lever that you flip up and down to stop up the tub, too!
