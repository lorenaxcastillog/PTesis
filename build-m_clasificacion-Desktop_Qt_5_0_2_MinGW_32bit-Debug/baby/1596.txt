 I have read and re-read reviews for bottles and have found that the only way to really find the right bottle is to try them out (no wonder this is a multi-billion dollar industry). We tried Playtex Drop-Ins and were frustrated about 6 weeks in that feedings were taking an hour with the Slow nipples. The Fast nipples drenched our son in formula. We moved to Avent with a Stage 2 nipple and found ourselves in the 50% of people who can't get them shut properly. Loved the nipple shape and speed, couldn't deal with the leaking. We tried Playtex Ventaire. Although this bottle claims to not let air in through the nipple, we apparently couldn't get these closed correctly either. Air entered through the nipple at every feeding and caused gas and spit-up problems. We eventually made our way back to the Drop-Ins, our son now old enough to handle the Fast nipple, we like these the best. I still feel reviews are beneficial, but know that your kid will let you know if he or she needs a change. Find what works for you and go with it. I give the Drop-Ins 4 stars. If Playtex would put out a Medium flow nipple, it would be 5
