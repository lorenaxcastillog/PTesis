 We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters. The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate. This gate is well worth the money. The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course. It is so much easier for everyone. With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day. You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again. I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box. The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!) I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured. I was very impressed! I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone. Service like that is not so common anymore. Like I said, great concept and service
