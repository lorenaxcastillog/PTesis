 This is a great little stroller for me as I am in Japan where you really need a stroller that fits in small spaces. The stroller is very sturdy but light which is great for quick trips in and out of the car. The recline is good for my 4 month old but I did put a neck insert in for extra support when she falls asleep. The basket is decent size for this size of stroller(will fit small purse or diaper bag). It folds very nicely and has the handle on the side for carrying. Another thing I like about it is that the canopy is hugh and covers my daughter completely. I love the fact that it comes with all the accessories too! I really don't have any complaints exept that the handles don't adjust so a taller person might say that they are too short(I'm only 5'2"). Overall I would recommend this stroller to anyone.
