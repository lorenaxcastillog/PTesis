 Just love it! I had the Jeep tandem and it was nice until my son got so big (40 lbs, 39 inches) you couldn't steer it very well. The BOB is amazing! I have a 3 yr & 1 yr old. You can't feel the weight difference. It rides so nicely. Both my children are very tall/heavy (dense) for their age and my eldest has plenty of room to grow - which was my biggest concern. My husband just loves the shocks - go figure. It compacts nicely....and if you need it even more compact the wheels come off in a snap and can be stored in the seat. It's amazing! I'm so glad I purchased it. REI has a great price on it ($400+/-...tried Ebay too but REI was best. Have fun in your stroller search and good luck
