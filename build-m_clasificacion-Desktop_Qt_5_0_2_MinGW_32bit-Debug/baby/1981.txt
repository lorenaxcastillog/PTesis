 When I was expecting my first child, a daughter, I had decided that I was going to buy the Graco SnugRide infant carseat. When I was at my local Babies R Us store I saw the SafeSeat and loved the fact that it has a weight limit of 30 lbs and 32 inches for the height. It's bigger and a little heavier then the SnugRide but I know my daughter will be safer rear-facing beyond her first birthday. Another good thing about this carseat is that after she grows out of it I won't have to buy a convertible carseat because she can go right into the booster seat I already have for her that has a weight range from 20 to 100 lbs. I love this carseat and it's well worth the extra $50. The only thing I didn't like was the fabric, it felt stiff and that's why I bought the carseat and stroller in a different pattern. I installed this carseat a week before I had her with no problem. I highly recommend this carseat
