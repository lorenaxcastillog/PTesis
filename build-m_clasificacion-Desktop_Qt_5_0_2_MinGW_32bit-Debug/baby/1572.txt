 This product is really wonderful when traveling by airplane. It just hooks to your carry on luggage on wheels and the child sits right in it as you stroll through the airport. So many people made comments about it as I walked through airports while traveling. They thought it was the neatest thing. I was 6 months pregnant when I first used it and it was great to not have to lug a big stroller around and I had less things to take with me. I gave it 4 stars only because it does take a short time to hook/unhook it every time you get on or off the plane. I had to pull to the side and keep my daughter with me while I hooked the seat back on to the luggage. But other then that it is one piece of nylon and not a huge stroller and I will take that anyday
