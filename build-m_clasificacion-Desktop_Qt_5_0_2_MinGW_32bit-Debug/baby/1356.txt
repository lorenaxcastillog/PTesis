 I only wish the crayons were thicker so they wouldn't break so quickly! I purchased this for my 20 month old and she absolutely loves this. She comes to the shower when I'm in it saying "color" and tries to get in just to color with it on the wall! I will put her in the shower and let her color while I shower, then get out, and let her continue to color while I'm getting dried off then bathe her. She actually hates getting out of the bathtub now! I'd recommend this to anyone with children who love to draw or color. The crayon marks are easily removed off of any tile or ceramic tub (though I don't know how well it would work with those plastic/laminate ones) and with the side compartments to hold the crayons in with the holes so the crayons can dry, there's no crayons lying all over the bathtub. The most used Christmas gift yet (and even loved by my 9 year old son!)
