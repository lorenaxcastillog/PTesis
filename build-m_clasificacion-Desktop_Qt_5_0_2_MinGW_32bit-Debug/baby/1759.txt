 I bought this item a little sceptical afetr reading some of it's negative reviews. I thought it was going to be unsturdy. It is light weight but it carried everything perfectly. I put my baby's diaper in it along with a bunch of her little bathroom things. The velcro straps were a little too short for my crib which I thought was a negative at first, but I had some pretty ribbon and I tied it to the end of my crib using the little loop-holes in the back. It gave it the prettiest effect. I would recommed this over anything. Everything is just a reach away
