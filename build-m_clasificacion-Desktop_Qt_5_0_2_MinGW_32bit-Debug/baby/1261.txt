 i got this for my second kid, and i would be going crazy without it! my baby is too small(6 1/2lbs) for my baby bjorn(8lbs min.) which i used for my toddler when he was a baby. i can go anywhere, do anything while wearing it, and my toddler can have my full attention while i'm keeping my baby close. it is so easy to breastfeed in, no adjustments needed like the bjorn, and no one can even tell! my toddler at 30lbs even enjoys a ride sometimes for fun! and those who complain about pain should first put the strap over the shoulder bone, not the muscle, and then realize that you are still carrying a baby on your body and the sling won't make the weight disapear! when my toddler is in it, i'm still carrying 30 lbs but it's spread over my body, not just my arms and hip! i have not had any problems with the straps loosening, and it fits me perfectly and i'm 5'6". i highly recomend it, just realize that it may take getting used to if you aren't used to carrying weight on your back. this sling is awesome and it doesn't make me feel like a hippi
