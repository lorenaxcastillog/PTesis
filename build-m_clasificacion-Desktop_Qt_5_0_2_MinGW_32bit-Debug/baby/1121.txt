 I did as much research as I could before purchasing two of these car seats for my grandson (one for my car and one for my daughter). This car seat always seemed to rank pretty well, and the price was affordable, so I bought it. My first impression of the car seat came when I lifted the box - it was so light! After weeks of hauling my steadily-growing big-for-his-age grandson in his infant seat, it was so nice to lift something that didn't feel like a cement brick. The straps were very easy to adjust for his comfort, and the bottom liner is going to be great for those oops. The seat is truly very easy to adjust, compared to others I looked at. And my grandson is very comfortable in it. It was a wonderful purchase for us, in every respect
