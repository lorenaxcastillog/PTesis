 Okay, the day we arrived home from the hospital we put her in this seat and she slept for hours, she loves this chair. The downside to this chair is that it cost 50+ dollars to begin with, and then you have to replace the batteries once a week, 3 C batteries (which isn't cheap)! We have spent well over 15 dollars in batteries in the 2 weeks that we have been home, and we only turn the chair on when she is fussy, it doesn't run all of the time. But, if you can afford to run out and get batteries every 4 days or so, this chair is awesome. It is very soft, and she loves it. I am not sure what we would have done without it
