 I didn't realise how awful my evenflo electric pump was 'til I used this one. Where the evenflo was painful and annoying to use, this little hand held manual pump is easy to use, painless because I control how hard and fast it pulls, does not sound like a dying cow (virtually silent), has less parts and does a MUCH better job. It feels very similar to my baby's suckling and as a result my milk will let down sometimes 3 times during a single pumping. :) To sum it up--It's fast, easy and effecient. I plan to take it with me in my diaper bag for whenever I need it. I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a breast pump.
