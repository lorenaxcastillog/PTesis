 I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance. After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor. The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too hard to use. You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice. When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell. Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily. The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!). It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid). We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the "blowouts", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean. It has been a wonderful new baby tool
