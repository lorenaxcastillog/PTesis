 I am not an expert in anything. I am an emergency room nurse though, and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS. We thought we'd try this product as the reviews are great. We love it. The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration! I would highly recommend this for every baby, as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age. I feel so much better, knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing. We plan to take this with us when we travel. It is easy to use and it really works. If you buy the one with the two parent units, you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead, or as well
