 I think this item is very good. The only problem we are having is the steps could be just a bit longer to fit our toilet better. When he goes to set down the steps come up off the floor and it gets a bit wobbly. But he really likes the idea of climbing a "ladder" and using the potty (big toilet) himself. Potty training must be one of the most challenging things to teach a child, every little thing that can make it a bit easier is great! The only thing with the steps is they really need to take off their pants/shorts before stepping up. They can not step up and get turned around with them pulled down, and the steps are not secure enough to pull down their pants once they are up there, at least my son can not do that yet without feeling like he will fall. But, if it gets him more willing to use the potty this item is doing its job IMO
