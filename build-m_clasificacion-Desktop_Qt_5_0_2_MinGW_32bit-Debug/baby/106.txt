 I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item. I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well. The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child. And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself. I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version. I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use. I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made. I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time. The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric. I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry. The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase.
