 The first night we had our daughter home, she would wake up about every 45 minutes. My wife and I were pulling shifts to take care of her. Finally, at 6am, my wife says, "Hey, lets try the secure sleeper that we bought". We haven't removed it from her bassinet since. The product does as it says and we swear by it. She is only 2 1/2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5-6 hrs a night. The velcro "rolls" can adjust to the babies size. The previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large. Given the size of the secure sleeper, it's not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper. Overall, a great product!
