 I read several reviews about the JJ Cole Essentails Sling Diaper Bag before I chose to purchase it. The reviews did not let me down! This is a great diaper bag that even dad will be proud to carry around. The compartments are large enough to hold a days outing worth of supplies for your little one and even a few items for yourself. This bag is large enough to work as both your diaper bag and purse while being small enough to not feel as if you're taking your whole nursery with you. The best feature of this diaper bag is that it is a sling. You won't have to fumble around anymore like with the usual shoulder bag that just doesn't stay in place while toting a little one on your hip or over your shoulder
