 I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!
