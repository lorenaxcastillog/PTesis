 Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle
