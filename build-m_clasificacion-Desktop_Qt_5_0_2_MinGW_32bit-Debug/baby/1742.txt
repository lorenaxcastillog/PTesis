 We ordered this crib on-line from Babies"R"Us/Amazon and we like it a lot! Not only that it arrived one week earlier than the estimated arrival time but it also came in a very good condition. I had read the reviews before we ordered the crib and realized that we were taking a risk as quite a few customers were complaining about problems with trasportation or serious damages due to poor packaging. Our crib arrived in an almost perfect condition. The only reason I did not give it 5 star rating is because one piece that we're going to need when we convert to toddler bed has a chip in it; it is not too bad though. Also, assembling the crib was not a problem at all for my husband and one of our friends. Following the instructions, they were able to assemble in about 1 and 1/2 hour. As I said before, we're very satisfied with our selection, now we're just waiting for our baby girl (due March 21, 2006) to see how she likes it.
