 I tried to put this oven "lock" on my oven. Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick. I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place. Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there. Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck. In the trash it went. I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle. So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4" of the adhesive strip on the oven. Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door. In the trash it went as well. I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens. :
