 It is true what others are saying this product is really easy n your back, I have tried others and this one is far more better. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to put on, but with practice you get the hang of it. Oh! be patiente too, at time while you are learning your baby might not like it because she might get fussy waiting for you, so do it when she is in a good mood or practice first with a doll
