 This item is packaged horribly. If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price. Received changing hutch and tower, crib and toybox intact. Very happy. Ordered this dresser twice, both times damaged. Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks. My suggestion is to order two dressers, take the best pieces from each, and return the rest. Believe me, you will be glad you did
