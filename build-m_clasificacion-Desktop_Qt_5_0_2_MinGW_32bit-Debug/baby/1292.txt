 I can't say enough good things about this jogger! It has become our "everyday" stroller! My 18 month old has always been an "in arms" baby. I wear him in slings, even now at 24 pounds. But, he LOVES this ride! The swivel-wheel in front makes it super-easy to maneuver, turn, and steer. I often see parents with the older-model BOB (pre-swivel) and they have to make awkward turns by rolling their joggers onto the back wheels. What a pain! I'm SO glad I got the Revolution! Ours is the "Mesa Orange" color, but I think it reminds me of Tomato Soup, Reddish Orange, and not too bright. It reclines enough for my son to nap, and has a flap so I can look in on him. The only thing I would change is that the basket at the bottom is hard to access when my son is in the jogger. Also, if there were some sort of iPod attachment/pocket that would be a HUGE plus! (Like the Jeep stroller has) But, I purchased some folding speakers, and used velcro to seucure them (temporarily) to the canopy. Now we have tunes on our walks! I use my console (purchased seperately) to hold my cell phone, keys, iPod, and sippy cup and water bottle. Love the BOB!
