 We bought this high chair for our daughter and we love it. It's easy to use and set up. I would have given five stars but to unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too "handy" when you have a crying baby in one of the them. The seat adjusts up and down so your child can sit right at the table with you. As stated above, the legs fold together so you can store the chair when not using. The chair cover is also easy to take off when it needs to be cleaned(which we do in the tub) and is attached with snaps. My little one is ten months old, 19 pounds, 27.5 inches and not even close to outgrowing this chair. I definitely recommend this chair. Hope this helps!
