 The stroller is a little flimsy for everyday use, and the whole thing is kinda heavy (especially with the baby in it). It is not hard to transfer from stroller to car seat and back, but you need to have a little upper body strength if the baby is still in it. I use it as our regular carseat, but not our regular stroller. We only use the stroller option in airports. As for using it for flying, I wouldn't do without it. It is FAA approved, fits in all airplane seats that I've tried (coach), and it goes easily through the security checks. It is worth the cost just for this. I really like this product if you are a frequent flyer; however, it is kind of a money-waster if you don't
