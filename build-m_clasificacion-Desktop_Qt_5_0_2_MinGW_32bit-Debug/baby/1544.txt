 How many times a night do you go into your baby's room to make sure the covers are still on them? Yeah, well, you can stop doing that now. Just buy this. The sack zips in the opposite direction so as not to catch on baby's skin. I must have washed this thing a trillion times and it held up wonderfully. Just put your baby in his/her pajamas and zip them up in the Halo Sleep Sack. It doesn't look like much but it certainly keeps them warm! I must have pointed and laughed at my daughter for a good five minutes when I put her in this for the first time. It looks pretty comical on, but in a cute way. She also had plenty of room to move her legs and feet around . . . kind of like a mini sleeping bag that stays put. I highly recommend this and it makes an excellent baby shower gift
