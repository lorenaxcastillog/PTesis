 I have one of these cribs already for my son. We have another one on the way and when it came to the choice of which crib to buy there was no question. This crib is so versatile. It goes from a crib to a toddler bed and then to a full size. We can use it for years. I'm only 5'4" tall and I was a little worried about the side not moving down but it works out great for me even when it is on the lowest level. I would recommend this crib to anyone
