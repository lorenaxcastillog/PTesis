 I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son. When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable. I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face. So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference. It didn't. He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz. I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all. A big disappointment. If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn. A million times better than this
