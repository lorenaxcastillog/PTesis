 I have 3 kids and 2 dogs and I am so happy that I purchased this gate. I bought it when my 2nd child was born and it has become a consistant item in my house. We moved and I was concerned about the different size of the openings. There was not a problem. It is easy enough for my 5 year old to open, but sturdy enough to withstand my 2yr old and 1 yr old. I love the gate in regards to pets because it makes having company easy. I can keep my dogs in the house and yet they are away from my company. With out the gate I would be constantly fighting my toddlers to keep them out of the kitchen/trash/litter box/cabinets. Everyone who comes over to visit and has children or pets ask about the gate! Even though the price of the gate is kind of high, it is something that keeps giving. I love my gate even after almost 3 years
