 I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to. The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too... Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price..
