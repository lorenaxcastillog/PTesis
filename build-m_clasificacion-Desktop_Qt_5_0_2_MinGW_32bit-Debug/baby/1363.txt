 This product is really great. It is an inexpensive white noise maker to help baby sleep. I like that I can plug it in and it runs all night. Now when my son wakes at night he can settle himself back to sleep and it also helps him nap longer during the day. The only negative is that it does not remember your standard settings every time you turn it on. Each time you turn it on the volume is on low and the sound is the ocean. Also, if you have a power outage, the battery backup will kick in, however, not before the sound resets to low volume ocean sounds. I will say that I think I sleep better hearing the "rain" over the monitor
