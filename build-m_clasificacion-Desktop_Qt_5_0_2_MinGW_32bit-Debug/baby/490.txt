 I purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year. It was on clearance at Babies R Us for only fifteen dollars. It was well worth the price. The only problem I ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal. I do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it. The weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark. My brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him. I would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase, if you don't go ahead. I personally would still make this purchase. Another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a Sling. People never gave me those looks with this!
