 When we first received this stroller, we loved it! It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand. My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs. But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very "user-friendly." For one, the way it opened was not intuitive. We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby. Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system. As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket. These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo. We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were. They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps. He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels. Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated. The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.
