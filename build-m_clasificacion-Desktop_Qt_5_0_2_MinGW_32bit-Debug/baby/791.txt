 We've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size "big boy bed". We're quite satisfied with it. Construction: Very sturdy, our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way. The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep. We tug on it from time to time and it's not going anywhere. Assembly: Not too easy, the instructions are horrible, but once you realize on your own how it's supposed to go, the actual assembly is OK, but not quick. Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature. Hide away feature: This is what took away the 5th star. It's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed. That feature works but requires some wrangling. If you want the hide away feature for once in a while, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, if you plan to hide the rail daily, I don't recommend it for that. Making the bed: Easy to tuck the sheets around it, no need to hide away or struggle. Overall, I would highly recommend this bed rail, I read all the reviews, and asked many friends, and this seemed to be the best in all areas, and a good value for the price, considering other can be well over $xx
