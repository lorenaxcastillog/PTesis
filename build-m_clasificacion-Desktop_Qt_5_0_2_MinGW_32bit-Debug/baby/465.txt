 If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it. I keep all of the "out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~! The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!
