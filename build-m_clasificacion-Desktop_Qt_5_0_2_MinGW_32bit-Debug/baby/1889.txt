 I nurse my daughter, but she supplements with formula and takes a pacifier too. The lactation consultant suggested the Soothie products to improve my daughter's latch because of the long round nipple shape that's more natural for nursing babies. It's too soon to see if it made a difference, but my daughter LOVES the soothie bottles and paci's now! It took weeks before she'd take a Mam and over a week before she'd successfully drink from a Gerber bottle, but she took to Soothies instantly and in 5 mins or less prefered them to the products she'd been using for months! They're so much easier for her to suck and hold in her mouth. The price is great too, about 1/2 the price of the same set with Avent products. My 2 complaints are: 1) the leaking bottles and 2) the pacifier looks weird and doesn't attach to a pacifier keeper. The leaking can be fixed by getting the part where the rim of the bottle meets the nipple wet to create a full seal. Also, it helps to "swirl" the formula to mix instead of "shaking" it... it takes a bit longer, but you end up with less mess and less bubbles
