 I first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1. He LOVED it, it was his best birthday gift. Since then, it has become our standard one-year-old gift. I've given it to dozens of children and received rave reviews every time. When a friend bought this for my son's first birthday, we were thrilled. He and his friends are now nearly four and still like to swing in it even though they have mastered the big-boy swing. My one-year-old will sit in it watching the big kids play in the garden and he is a mover - does not like to sit still at all. It is also perfect on days when the ground is too wet to crawl around (which seems like everyday lately). By the way, I read the 'upside down' post. I was concerned and tried to turn mine upside down without a child in it and the ropes are balanced that I could not turn it even empty. That family may have had defective ropes or it was installed improperly..
