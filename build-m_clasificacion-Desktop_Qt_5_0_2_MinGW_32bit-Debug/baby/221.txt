 I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable. It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for. It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic). I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled. It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't. It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles. Ahhhhh
