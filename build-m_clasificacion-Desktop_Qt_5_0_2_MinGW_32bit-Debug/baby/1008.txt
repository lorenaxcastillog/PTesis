 We've been using this for three weeks now and don't have a single complaint (yet). We love the fact that it's a plug-in too! Our little girl is mesmerized by the mobile and the music is almost hypnotizing (and surprisingly good quality). We don't use the tray or restraints so we can swaddle her before putting her down, and she's usually fast asleep within minutes. Once she starts interacting with toys, we'll use the activity tray and I'm sure she'll enjoy that as well. The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise, but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out. I would have rated it as 5 stars, but the color is not optimal -- we're not huge fans of pink, and would have rather chosen the blue swing with stars if it weren't $40 more
