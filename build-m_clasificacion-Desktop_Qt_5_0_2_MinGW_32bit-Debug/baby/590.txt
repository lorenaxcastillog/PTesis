 I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son. My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children. Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well. He loves the arm rests and the cup holder. It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary. We liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition
