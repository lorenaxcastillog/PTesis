 When buying a convertable car seat for our daughter, we were looking for one that was not only safe and easy to install, but also would be extra comfortable. Both mine and my husbands families live a day's drive away, and we wanted a car seat that would be extra soft and comfortable. This one has turned out to be wonderful! Very easy to install, has the 5-point harness which is the safest way to strap a baby in, and the padding is thick and cozy. Very simple to turn it from rear-facing to forward-facing. I've noticed that I cannot loosen the straps unless I completely take it out of the car, and I'm going to have to get the manual to figure it out, but I'm sure I'll get it. (Side note: I also took this as a checked item on a flight, and the car seat made it without a scratch!
