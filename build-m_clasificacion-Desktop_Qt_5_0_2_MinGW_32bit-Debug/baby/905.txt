 I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors
