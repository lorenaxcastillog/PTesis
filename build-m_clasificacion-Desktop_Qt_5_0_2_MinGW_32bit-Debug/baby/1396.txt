 This is a wonderful product. I am a first time mom, neurotic, I know. But there is such a difference in my peace of mind with this monitor. I highly recommend it. We have had three false alarms, and only because our daughter is a very active sleeper and jammed herself into the corner of the crib, and out of range. Even then, it is worth it. I'd rather know if she has her face buried in the crib bumper so I can slide her out to the middle. It's great, I can't say that enough. I'm so glad I am having kids now when there are products like these available
