 My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl (Apr. 9, 2007) and I simply could NOT live without this item. My daughter loves sleeping in it. It is light; therefore, it can be easily moved from one room to another, as needed. You could easily travel with it.... from hotels to the "Grandparents house." It can be folded compactly and easily stored; and, there is also a handle for carrying. The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well. ***Obviously, do not leave your child unsupervised in it!** It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents
