 I have had this stroller for a little over a year now, and it is an awesome stroller! I have not had the "wobbly" or hard-to-steer problem at all. I have had my son in it since he was 4 months old (he is 20 months now), and it is still very sturdy. I had a Graco Quattro Tour for 2 days and took it back...it was too big, and way too big of a hastle to get in and out of the car. I can put my Aria in and out of my SUV with one arm and it opens and collapses VERY easily (like any stroller, it takes a little practice). I bought a mommy canvas tray for drinks and keys, no big deal...and I have always been able to fit my diaper bag and a few small shopping bags in the under-carriage. We are expecting baby #2 and are registering for the Twin version. I highly recommend the Aria, if you are a mom that is more about having a light-weight stroller.
