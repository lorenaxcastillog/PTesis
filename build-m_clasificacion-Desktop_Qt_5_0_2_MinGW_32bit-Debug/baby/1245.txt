 I love the Bundle Me lite. I live in CA so it's perfect for those "cold" days. I have a heavier one for the snow but still haven't used that yet. The lite is wonderful, I put it on & I don't worry about blankets slipping off and getting dirty. The top zips right off so when it's warm and not needed you don't have to mess with taking the whole thing off. And it is super soft. I wish I had this with my first two babies. My third's the one that lucked out
