 Our Hungry Pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years. The bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing. His fat cheeks squeak, his wings crinkle, and his feet rattle. He comes with four sea creatures (crab, shrimp, fish, and octopus) that are each different textures and colors, and make different sounds (rattle, rustle, etc.). Children can put the little animals into pelican's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy. The large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again. I found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds, colors, and textures of the four little sea creatures. Toddlers progress to the eating game. I am grateful to Mr. Pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning. What can be better than that!
