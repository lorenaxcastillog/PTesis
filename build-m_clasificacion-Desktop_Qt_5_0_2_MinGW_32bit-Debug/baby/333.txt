 I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item! When it first came out, I purchased one for my son (he was around six months old at the time). He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back, extending his arms behind him, and straightening his legs, so I returned it. By the time I had my second child (a girl), Bumbomania had kicked in, and these seats were EVERYWHERE. I began to think that my son's experience was a fluke, and I purchased another one for my daughter. Low and behold, she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY! So I returned the second Bumbo as well, but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children "may" be able to get out of the seat. In conclusion, although the Bumbo may work great for some - BEWARE! If you have little Houdinis like I do, this product is simply not safe
