 This breat pump was a life saver. I have used when I was working part-time and even during full-time and the pump has never failed on me. Its easy to use, doesn't hurt at all, not to mention it was very fast. I remember pumping 10 onces in 10-12 minutes. The clean up was an absolute breeze and the best part was that I could fit in the pump in my little purse and no one would ever know. My daughter was used to Playtex bottles so I used the liners on the playtex one step storage system and attached it to the medela pump. This worked like a charm and didn't have to transfer milk from one bottle to another. This pump is worth every penny.
