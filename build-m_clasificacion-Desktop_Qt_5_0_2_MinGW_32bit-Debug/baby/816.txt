 I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU. Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump. The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn't purchased. I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples. Well this is what he brought back. The relief was instantaneous. I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter "learned" to breastfeed. I use another of their nipple creams for everyday use(they're too expensive to use everday), but I make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet!
