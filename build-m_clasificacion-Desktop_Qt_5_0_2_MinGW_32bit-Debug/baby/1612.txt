 I was wondering the same thing about this stroller - i.e. how does it convert to "stand" mode? etc. I had seen the version of this stroller on the One Step Ahead website, so I called Baby Trend and they told me it is the exact same stroller. It is just marketed differently for the different vendors... and they are different colors. So, you can go to the One Step Ahead website to get more views of the stroller. I still have not purchased it yet, worried about the quality and the overall length of the stroller. But it does seem to be one of the lightest double strollers available. Good Luck
