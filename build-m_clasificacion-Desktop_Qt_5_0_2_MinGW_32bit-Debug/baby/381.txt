 I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son. Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world. This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past. I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old. My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it. Anyways, it was a huge disappointment. The steering is AWFUL. You definately need TWO hands for this stroller. The stroller is also extrememly "wobbly". I was shocked as I figured such an "upscale" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much. The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little "envelope" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place. It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller. I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller. I could kick myself for wasting the money. My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name
