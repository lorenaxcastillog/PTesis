 My daughter recently had her second child, and spends alot of time breastfeeding. This product allows her to pump at her convenience. She can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child. The product works very well. She said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her, but it is an excellent product. She previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer, and heard how good the Medela brand was from a friend. This brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive, noisier pump she had before. We would highly recommend this product, and the product is well worth the price paid
