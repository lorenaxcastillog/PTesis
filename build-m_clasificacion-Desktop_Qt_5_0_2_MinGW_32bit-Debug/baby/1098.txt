 I am a Child Care Provider and one of my clients came in with a Bundleme in her child's car seat and I thought what a great idea. I never saw one of those. So I went online and found them and low and behold I bought 3 because I have 3 babies. I am buying 3 more for the stroller I have. They are the best thing since the baby activity centers. Plus it makes an old 24 year old, 3 seater stroller seats, look new again. I couldn't beat the price on the Bundleme in any store near by so that's why I got them online, it was also free shipping.
