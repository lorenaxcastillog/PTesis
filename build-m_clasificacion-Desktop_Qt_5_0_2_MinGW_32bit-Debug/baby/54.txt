 We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first. I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it. The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in. As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer. There should be some way to fix it when it pops out. Definitely would not reccommend it. To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept
