 This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier: 1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion. 2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top. I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them. On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of.
