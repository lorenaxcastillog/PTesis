 I had purchased the Dr. Brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness. They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most. By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else. At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks - *using only all dry parts for each new bottle *not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside *not overfilling After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides! Finally, the answer to the leaks!!! Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun. These items were meant for baby use, and for the price it should help make babies' & mom's life easier. Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners. Thank you & Good Luck
