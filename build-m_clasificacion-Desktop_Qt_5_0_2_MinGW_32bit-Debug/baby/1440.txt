 We bought this for the door to our 2yr old daughters room once she transitioned to her toddler bed. It is nice and sturdy, seems to be very well made we love the taupe color. It is not wobbly at all. It took my husband 10-15 minutes out of the box to working. I love that we do not have to take it on and off to get through each time. The swing gate is easy for us adults to use but too difficult for my daughter to figure it out. I love it so much I am going back to purchase another one to use on the spare bedroom door!! Yes i did brush my toe against the bar once, now I know to step over it, not too difficult! Well worth the $34!
