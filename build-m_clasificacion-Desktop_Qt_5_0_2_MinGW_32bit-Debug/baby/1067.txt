 I bought one of these bouncers at Walmart for my daughter. She is a very fussy baby who cries WHENEVER she is awake. I placed her in the bouncer and she was content for once. I sat her in the upright position and she loved looking around and she fell asleep without crying, for the first time. The music is very cute. I always try to shop around for a cheap bouncer. This is my second bouncer I have owned. Both were the cheapest one I could find ($20). This $20 bouncer works just as good as an expensive one! Don't burn your money on those $40-$70 bouncers. This one is a good buy!!!! It's blue but my daughter looks so cute in it... so I would call it unisex. Try one out
