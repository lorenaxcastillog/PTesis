 I love this car seat, but more importantly, my 7-month old baby girl seems to love it too. We switched her to this seat when she was 6 months old, and car rides have been a whole lot better. She has plenty of room and it reclines better than her infant car seat (Graco snugride), and it is well padded. We call it the princess' throne. My husband was shocked at first at how much this thing costs, but now he understands why. This was so easy to install and very safe. I love the latch system--the thing barely moves. You can't put a price on safety. Plus this will grow with her until maybe she's about 5. Also, you cannot go wrong with this beautiful fabric. I love it--not another pink, but very girlie and sweet. I LOVE IT! WELL WORTH THE $$
