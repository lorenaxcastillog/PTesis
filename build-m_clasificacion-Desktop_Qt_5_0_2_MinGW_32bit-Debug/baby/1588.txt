 GIVING THIS ONLY FIVE STARS IS AN INSULT!! IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH! THANK GOD FOR THE SECURE-ME TRAVEL SEAT!! MY LIFE IS FOREVER CHANGED!!! FIRST OF ALL IT TAKES ONLY 5 SECONDS TO SET THIS UP IN A SHOPPING CART. I HAD MY "SQUIRMY" 9 MONTH OLD BABY IN ONE ARM AND MY HUGE DIAPER BAG IN THE OTHER AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF "HOW IN THE WORLD AM GOING TO DO THIS"? BUT, LOW AND BEHOLD 5 SECONDS LATER IT WAS IN, SHE WAS IN AND WE WERE READY TO STROLL THE AISLES. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST $14.99 I HAVE EVER SPENT IN MY LIFE! IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER BRAND YOU ARE JUST CRAZY!!
