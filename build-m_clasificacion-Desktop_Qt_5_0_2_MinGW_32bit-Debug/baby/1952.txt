 We already have the Evenflo Triumph Premier. After a few initial problems with that one, we got used to it and my (large) 9 month old son is very comfortable in it. I decided to buy the Titan because it also had good safety ratings and was lighter than the Triumph. As a second seat, we wanted something more lightweight and portable since it would be moved between my husband's car and grandparents' cars. It's very easy to use, equally as comfortable as the Triumph, but slightly less plush. I find the more simplistic harness adjustment much less of a struggle with the Titan. That was my husband's #1 complaint about the expensive Triumph. Good all around seat purchase. No complaints
