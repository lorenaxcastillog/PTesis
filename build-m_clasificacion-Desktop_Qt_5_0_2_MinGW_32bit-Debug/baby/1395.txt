 My son was premature and was on an Apnea/Heart monitor for the first six months. We recently had a string of good downloads so his cardiologist decided to take him off the monitor. I didn't sleep for a week just lying there watching him breath (still worried), until I saw this product and ordered it right away. I've had it for about a month now and have slept much better and I know he does too since I'm not putting my hand on his back every five minutes. The problem I have with the product- The other night my son was crying and I picked him up, forgetting to turn the monitor off and it kept sensing movement (ticking). It never alarmed! My husband and I must have watched and waited for 10 minutes. NO ALARM! Now I'm wondering if it would alarm at all. I hope it's something I'm doing wrong and can figure it out. Too many good reviews not to be a good device. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I just wish I knew why it didn't alarm
