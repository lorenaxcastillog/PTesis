 I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far. I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time. It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments. The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it. I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect
