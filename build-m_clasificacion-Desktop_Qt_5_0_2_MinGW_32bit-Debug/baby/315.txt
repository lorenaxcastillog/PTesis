 These retail now for $229 at BRU. Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit! This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego! All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :). I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store? It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too! Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2. Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price
