 We have this system on our baby's crib, and he seems to like it more than just having music playing on a nearby stereo. The sound quality is good at low volumes, which are appropriate for a crib at bed or naptime, but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it at all. So, if you are planning on using this for yourself, think again - but that's not what it's designed for. I do agree that the no-A/C adapter option stinks, but having caught our baby holding on to the IPod charging cord when the IPod was in this device, I realize that having an A/C adapter would just be a hazard - rechargeable batteries would be a great addition - that's the only reason I'm giving it four stars. Our baby LOVES to look at the lights. The 15 minute timer is great too, as that's all he really needs. I'd buy it again, and plan on getting it for friends with new babies
