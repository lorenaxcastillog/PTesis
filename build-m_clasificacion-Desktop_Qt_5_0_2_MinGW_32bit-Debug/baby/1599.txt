 I had my first baby in 2004, and being a new mom spent tons of money on the cute little bottles with pictures and designs on them only to come to realise that they gave my daughter the worst gas ever. I switched to the playtex bottles right away, and didn't have any trouble after that! My second baby came in 2005 and being in denial, tried the cutsie bottles again thinking maybe it was just my daughter. Sure enough tummy ache, and lots of gas! Playtex bottles came back into our home right away, and never had another problem. I just couldn't believe that they worked so wonderful. They are so much easier to wash, being the pre-sterilized liners just pop right in, and the larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples that some bottles have. My sister in law had her first baby in November, and I swore to her that they worked like a charm. I bought her tons for her baby shower, and she started on them, mixed with the breast, and was also amazed that they worked miracles! I would guarentee positive results to anyone who asked, and wouldn't recommend anything else. Those cute bottles may be calling, but itn't worth your little one in alot of pain and discomfort
