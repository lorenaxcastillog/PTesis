 My son has a great time with his bath turtles. He's learned the colors and play features on each turtle, so that's an educational plus that I did not expect at all! Somehow, the turtles end up floating upside down during bath time--splash factor, maybe? But that's half the fun--making him turn them over again for more play. They are easy to clean and dry so that's a plus. The one bath turtle I don't completely understand is the one with the mirror inside. Because of the temperature of the water, it causes condensation in the protective plastic bubble, so he can't see the mirror anyway, so what's the point in that one? Nevertheless, he kinda looks at it in the middle of his bath and probably thinks, "Hey, I was there a minute ago..." He picks that one up, holds it up to his eye level, struggles to find himself for a second, laughs, and puts it back in the water and picks up another turtle. Go figure. It's still good fun for him, and the turtles keep him occupied during the shampooing and what not, therefore, they're okay by me! Totally safe and drain proof
