 This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life! It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through. My daughter is AMAZING! I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement. Baby Plus did everything it promised and more! Here are some examples: At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry. At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces. At 2 months: laughing, holding head up At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle At 4 months: sitting with support At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling. I am completely amazed at her advancements. People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known. I am totally sold on Baby Plus
