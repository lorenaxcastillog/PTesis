 This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib. We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't. As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money. At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work. Her sister's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys, an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use
