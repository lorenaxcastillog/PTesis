 I have had the Harmony for seven months and use it about 2-3 times a day. It it still working great with all the original parts. I have not had to buy replacement anything. I do admit I recently tried another pump. It was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby. With in two days I called the company, I got a refund and am back to my Harmony. This is a great pump and I am so happy that we bought it. Stop searching and buy this pump
