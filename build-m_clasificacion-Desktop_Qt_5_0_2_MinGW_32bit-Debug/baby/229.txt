 I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy. The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom. And you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm. Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards. I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more. I do not think this product is safe. It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it. So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child
