 This stroller holds up to 55 lbs., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs. I love the raised handle bars. They cause less strain on your shoulders and back. There is a roomy basket under the seat, which is a great bonus. The 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass. Once my son was able to sit up on his own, I have used an umbrella stroller exclusively. This is hands down the best one I have ever had. It is also very modern looking in black and gray
