 This is a great price for a 4 pc set. (I got ours at walmart for $35) The comforter is not thick and plushy. Its very thin and stiff. But then again, for the price, its ok. The sheets are adorable. We bought a very soft, fuzzy Dora blanket to go with it. But the comforter that comes with it is definately cute. Maybe after a few washes it will soften up some. I would still buy it again for the price. But if you are looking for a thick, soft warm comfoter, then this is not the one you want
