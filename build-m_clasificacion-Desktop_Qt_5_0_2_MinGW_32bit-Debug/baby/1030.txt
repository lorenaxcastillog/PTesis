 This is a good looking functional gate that the toddlers cannot open, but most of us adults can open with one hand. (I had to show a couple of guests how to do it without damaging it). We had trouble with the delivery, only because UPS left it at the entryway of the wrong house - - - the one next to us that was empty and up for sale. Assembly was a little difficult because the instructions were all pictures with very few words. If it is being installed between two walls that have no molding obstructions, it's fine. However, in my case, I have the high 6-inch baseboard and I have wainscotting with a chair-rail. These moldings created uneven surfaces and I could not install the gate without making wooden spacer blocks that I had to paint white to match the gate. It took me five hours to get it done, and I'm handy (although a bit of a perfectionist). Anyhow, it looks and works great, and we've gotten compliments about it. I thought it was a bit expensive, but I could not find anything else that looked good; as it is installed at the top of the stairs leading into our formal dining room. Despite the work to install it and the high price, it was worth it to me.
