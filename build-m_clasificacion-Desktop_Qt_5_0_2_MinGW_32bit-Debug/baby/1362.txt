 I think these pacifiers are great; they work either way so at night you don't have to feel around for a notch to make sure they're going in the right direction. They don't leave marks around my baby's mouth like another pacifier did. I believe the company is European, maybe that's why they're not as widespread in the U.S., but they're made well. The attachment is so useful, especially when you're out and about with the baby. Just imagine the horror when the pacifier drops out of the baby's mouth onto the germ-filled floor and there's no bathroom in sight to wash the pacifier
