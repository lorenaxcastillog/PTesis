 I received the safari bedding as a shower gift. I have the comforter, the bumper pad, the dust ruffle, two fitted sheets, and the rug. I also received the nightlight and valances as shower gifts. I was able to find the safari border at a Target Greatland in my area. It really adds to the room. I was also able to find the wall hangings, but I'm not sure if I will use them or not. Everything is well-made, and we hope to use it for baby number one, as well as other children that we might have in the future
