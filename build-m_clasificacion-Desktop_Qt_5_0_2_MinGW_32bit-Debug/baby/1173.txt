 Our baby wasn't sleeping too well in her bassinet when we first brought her home. Being first time parents, we were afraid to bring her into bed with us for fear of smushing her. So we went to Babies R Us and found this, purely by accident. Yes, the price is a little high for what we use mostly as just a sleep positioner, but we love that it folds up for travel. We are planning to skip the bassinet for a few upcoming trips and just take this with us. We have a queen-sized bed, and it is a bit snug for the three of us to fit, but we can do it. Now she is tolerating the bassinet so we've moved the nest to her bassinet. It inclines, and sometimes she wiggles down, but she is still positioned on her back! It comes with TWO sheets, which is great! It has a handy LED nightlight for quick pacifier replacement or covert diaper checks. The bedding is firm but comfy. I am very happy with the product, and I would recommend it to others. It's a pretty new product otherwise I would have put it on my registry when I was still pregnant.
