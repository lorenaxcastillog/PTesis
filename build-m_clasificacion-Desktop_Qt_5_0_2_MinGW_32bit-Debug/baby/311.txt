 The problems I had with this gate: 1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly. 2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break. 3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work. Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it. As for the locking mechanism, it's annoying, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse. This gate would not be safe for kids
