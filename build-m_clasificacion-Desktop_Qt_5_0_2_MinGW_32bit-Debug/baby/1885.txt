 I just had my third child and had to buy all new things, because I got rid of everything after my second child. I had a sling with the other two, but instead of getting the same one, I looked at the new ones, and this is far better than the old. I like the lighter fabric and its easy to fold up and stuff in the diaper bag. You do need to watch the DVD, but with a little practice anyone, even husbands can use it!! My son is 11 weeks old and has loved it since day one. When he is fussy, we put him in the sling and he instantly get quiet. This is the best one for back support also, I think
