 My sister had the Genie, my best friend had Diaper Champ, another friend used Neat! and because of my/their experience with all three, we chose this for our registry. I'm so glad we did. Yes, when it is full, some odor will come out when you dispose of another, but compared to the others that omit odor without touching it, this one is by far the best. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to remove the bag because I couldn't find directions anywhere, but once I realized there was a blade to cut it, then tie a knot, it's been smooth sailing. Love it
