 It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job
