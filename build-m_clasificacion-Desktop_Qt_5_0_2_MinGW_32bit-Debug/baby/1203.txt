 My Daughter and I LOVE this. I actually saw this before I was pregnant and loved it because I love Turtles. I always said I would buy this. I know that it's a bit pricey for what it is, but I justified it by making it my daughters gift for her first Christmas (she was only 1 month old). I put her to bed with it turned on in blue light and play soft relaxing music. She honestly goes down pretty well. It casts starts across her crib and up her walls and both my mom and husband complimented on how soothing I made her night time. the only thing is that the Amber light doesn't seem to work well in showing the stars, but there is Blue and Green. There is actually star constellations that it casts and it comes with a little book showing which ones they are.
