 I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy. Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva. Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc. I just don't see the difference in that and not using it. My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc. I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material! My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs. You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth
