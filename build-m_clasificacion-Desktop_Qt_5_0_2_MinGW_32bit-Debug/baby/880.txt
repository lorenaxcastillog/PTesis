 I researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born. After she was two weeks old, and my milk supply was established, I decided to purchase a pump. I had read many reviews about ISIS and was so skeptical...and I didn't want to pay $300 for an automatic one. I enjoy breastfeeding so much, however, I am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too. After much thought, I decided to purchase the ISIS &amp;quot;back to work&amp;quot;. It came with the pump, bottles and the tote (which by the way is very discreet). I had no trouble assembling it at all. From the first time I used ISIS I've had great success. I am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes, without any pain or discomfort as I control the suction. Our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all, nor have we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking. I assemble the pump and the nipples/rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet. I love how easy this is to use and I don't have to find a place to plug it in at work. The only thing I've noticed is that the little gel packs don't stay cool enough for my liking so I went and purchased 2 little ice packs (.90 cents) and they work like a charm! I would recommend this to any Mom!
