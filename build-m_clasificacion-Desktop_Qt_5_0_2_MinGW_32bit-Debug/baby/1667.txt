 I received my Graco Quattro Tour Stroller last week after waiting over a month for it to be released. It was SO worth the wait! This stroller is so easy to steer and both kids have plenty of leg room! There is a large storage basket underneath and plenty of cupholders. It pushes like a dream, even with my 2 boys who are over 30 lbs each! I have owned Duo Gliders in the past and they were so much bulkier than this and so hard to steer. I HIGHLY recommend this stroller. On another note, I was very pleased with the service I received from Amazon.com!
