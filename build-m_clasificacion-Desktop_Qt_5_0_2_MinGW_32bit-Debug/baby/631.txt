 My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right! Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet. First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off. Especially when you get it on there just right. Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners. Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion? Ugh, I don't think so. I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it. As far as the "imprint" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered
