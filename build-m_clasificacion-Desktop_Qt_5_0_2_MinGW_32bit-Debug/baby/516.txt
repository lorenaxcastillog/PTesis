 My first son had a race car bed which wasn't made very well. We moved him to a big bed when our second child was ready for the toddler bed. Well, we decided to get rid of the old car bed and get him his own Thomas bed for his 2nd birthday since he is OBSESSED with Thomas. BEST DECISION EVER! It is SO much better made that the other plastic beds! And I'm so glad I read the reviews...the springs from the crib fits PERFECTLY in the THomas bed (and it's pretty strong because I can lay in the bed with him at night if I have to). It is really worth the money. If you are looking into a cute toddler bed for a boy, I'd skip the other cute beds and go straight to this one! We all love it
