 Having played the non-electronic version, this upgrade does help game play move more smoothly. There are a few drawbacks however. It's easy to accidently reset the game by pressing the wrong button, and since teams are designated #1 and #2 on the controller AND the controller travels around the room, it's easy to get confused and give points to the other team by mistake. This happens a lot, especially if you're playing with a group who has not played recently or are not familiar with the game. The fact that there are no multiple parts is a big plus. This is a very good group word game once everyone gets into the groove
