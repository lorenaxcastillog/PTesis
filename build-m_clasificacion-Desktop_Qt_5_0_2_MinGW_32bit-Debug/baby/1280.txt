 What an amazingly great stroller. This is an umbrella stoller with all the bells and whistles. It is light enough but yet has heft. There is a detachable canopy... basket underneath... mesh baggy bottle holder... winter boot... rain cover and sun shade. There is so much. Where the child lays there is even a way to elevate the legs... you usually don't get that with the lighter strollers. If it gets too hot in the summer, you can even remove some of the fabric on the seat so that it is ventilated. I would say my favorite part is that on the canopy there is a zipper for parents to store what is necessary. First time I have seen that. Haven't really tested it yet, but it seems to roll smoothly, close down easily and open just as easily. I love the fact that I can push up the levers on the back of the stroller with my barefoot.... usually it hurts through my boots. Great buy... you won't regret it. The navy one really does look black, but the canopy seems navy. The accents that look hot pink in the picture are actually red. Good looking
