 I have had the pretty Petuina Pickle Bottom bag, the baby Bjorn diaper bag, and the baby sherpa bag and I have to say none of them functioned for me. For other moms I am sure those bags worked great for them but this tiny compact bag is the greatest. I wish I had this bag when my son was first born. Although it looks small it holds everything! And it gives you a chance to have your hands free without even feeling like you are wearing a bag. I am in love with this bag. It is so nice to go out and not feel like I am moving in. With my other bags they were so big and bulky and with this one it is like I don't even have it. Again it is a must have for all moms!!!! If you get the Black and Gray it is great for the dad's as well.
