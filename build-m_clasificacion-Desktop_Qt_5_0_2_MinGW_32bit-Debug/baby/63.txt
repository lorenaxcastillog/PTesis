 After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do). My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine. However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently. What a nightmare to collapse! Again, the directions are of absolutely no help. It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up. Also, this thing weighs a ton. I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling. How annoying. Bottom line: if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is). However, if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home, forget it!
