 Everyone tries to tell you that any breastpump that is any less than a hospital grade will not work if you are going back to work full time. But I found that this one worked just fine, I could pump for 15 minutes twice a day, and it worked great. I ended up not breastfeeding for as long as I had thought, and I am very glad I didn't spend $200-$300 on a breastpump. This one still works great, and I plan to use it for my next child. Not everyone needs a hospital grade pump, don't let people convince you of that. I gave it a 4 because it was a little loud, but not too bad
