 I am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath, its getting him out that's the problem. With the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas. Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys! My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet. You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler, it also makes a great place to color. Be careful to wash everything off before it dries.
