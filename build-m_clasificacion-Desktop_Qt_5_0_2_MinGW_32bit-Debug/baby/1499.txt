 We purchased this car seat for our daughter when she turned one and was 20 lbs. We loved our Peg Perego infant seat but she was clearly outgrowing it and uncomfortable. So far she loves this seat and I love the safety profile and color. She enjoys riding in this seat as it has plenty of room and fits her size well. The only 2 flaws that I find I personally dislike is 1. that you do not hear a distict "click" when you buckle the 5 point harness. For me this is juat a reassurance that it locked. 2. I dislike the rubber strap covers and may consider cutting them off. They make the straps harder to maneuver. I do like the velcro attachments on the side that allow you to pull the straps apart when you put the baby in. This is a real time and effort saver. Overall we really love the seat. We also purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our secondary car and it is a good seat overall but not as nice as the Britax. Plus the Britax goes to 65 lbs and the Graco only 40. Britax is definitely worth the money and the better seat for the primary car
