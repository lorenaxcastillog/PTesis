 My friend bought this for me because she swore by it with her son. It is excellent. First of all, I must say, the Gas Drops are just amazing. My daughter had so many problems with colic and gas and I used them all the time. They work wonders. The saline drops are great for the winter during cold season. I have already had to repurchase a few of the items. The case is great because it keeps everything in one place so I don't have to search for stuff.
