 We have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she's almost 2 now. We keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of "pocket bibsters." Whenever we eat out at a restaurant, we stick this down at our toddler's place. She sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate, it spills onto this nice clean mat. The mat also has entertainment value, as she can name the items on it. After she's made her mess, we just peel the mat off, wad it up, and throw it away
