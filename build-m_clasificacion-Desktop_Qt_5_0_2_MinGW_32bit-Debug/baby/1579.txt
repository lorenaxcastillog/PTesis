 Can I just tell you how much easier my life has been since I got the Potty Pal? What a hassel it was to have to put the removable seat on in a rush and take it off ten times a day. And when company came over . . . Aggghhh. Now it is as easy as flipping up the lid. My daughter doesn't have accidents standing in front of the potty waiting for me to adjust the seat. My guest aren't faced with that awkward situation of what to do with the potty seat when they need to use the toilet. Thank you Potty Pal!
