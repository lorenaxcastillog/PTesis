 These were the only sheets that I could find for my Pack 'N Play, and while they are a bit cheap looking, I find that they work just fine. They are pretty thin and they are not elasticized as the manufacturers claim they are on this site, but they function well enough. I live in the desert and my baby was born in August, so the thin (therefore cooler) construction of these sheets was a bonus. However, if you live in a colder place, you might want to try to come up with something a little cozier for your baby. On the whole though, these sheets are fine if you want something to cover the plastic mat of your Pack 'N Play
