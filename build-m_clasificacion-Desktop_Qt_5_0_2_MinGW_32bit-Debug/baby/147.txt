 Please spend your money on a different gate. There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate. We have twin girls in a bi-level house. A stair gate is a must. The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days. Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn. I will say - when it worked, it was nice. But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again. Shame on me for buying it again. It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use. I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere. If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design. Again, please look elsewhere
