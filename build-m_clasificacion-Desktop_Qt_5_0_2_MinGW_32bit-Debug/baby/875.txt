 My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself. So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don't have to worry. They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat. Great product! I highly recommend it!!!!
