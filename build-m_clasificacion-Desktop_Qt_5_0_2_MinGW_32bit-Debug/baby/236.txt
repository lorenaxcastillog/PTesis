 I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant). My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser. For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway. My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel "too snug" in it. They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep. If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it
