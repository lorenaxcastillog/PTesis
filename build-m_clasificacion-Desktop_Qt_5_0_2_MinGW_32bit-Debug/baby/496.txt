 There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate. She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate
