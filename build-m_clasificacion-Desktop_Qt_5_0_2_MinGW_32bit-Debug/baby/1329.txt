 We live on a small military base overseas. My first stroller got all moldy in storage, so we purchased this one when the new baby came. My 3 year old loves the stroller, he calls it his spaceship, or his horse depending on the day and his mood. He hasn't sat in a stroller since he learned how to walk, but he will ride on this all day long. My newborn loves the stroller as much as any newborn loves something. It handels very well, even on uneven cobblestone walkways. Everyone on base comments on how cool the stroller is, several friends with babies on the way are considering purchasing one of their own. We love it and are sort of glad our old one got moldy, so we could get the new one. :-
