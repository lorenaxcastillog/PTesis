 I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered. They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them. It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is lacking. I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now. I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company. They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting. Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me. They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to. Won't let me do a return. This is a bad way to run a business
