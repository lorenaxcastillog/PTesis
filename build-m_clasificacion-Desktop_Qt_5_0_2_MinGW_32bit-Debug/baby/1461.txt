 I have a smaller five year old that wanted to sit in a big boy chair, not the stool we had been using. After he destroyed one of our phone books, and scratched our wood chairs with a hard plastic seat, I found the Cooshie. I highly recommend it. It is easy to cart with you and he loves having a seat that can move around. We are looking forward to using it next week at a movie theater. No more coats! Consider this seat if your child is smaller, but no longer a toddler. In addition, he loved the color and the softness. What a bonus
