 I think the Soothing Motions Glider is a great product. My 6 week old daughter loves it, and she has slept many hours in it so far. It is very soothing to her. However, there doesn't seem to be much difference in the two speeds, and the noise can get a bit annoying. I can't say much for the music - I wish it was a bit more soothing for her. Regardless, she seems to love it. We have to put it on our coffee table so that our dog doesn't lick her to pieces ;) It's a very stable product
