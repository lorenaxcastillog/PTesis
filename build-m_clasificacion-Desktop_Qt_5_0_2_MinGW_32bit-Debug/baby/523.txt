 This is amazing I tell ya, Seriously I've doubted it since my first child, and then my twins ( never got it ) with them, just assumed it was some Hype. Well with my last baby, and finally a girl, I caved. Its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order ( or try ) anyway her screams were out of no where, she wasn't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you. and sometimes that wasn't good enough. she cried and cried and waled. it really drove us all bonkers. she isn't a pacifyer baby either, so we were at loss. she was obviously really gassy, she got hiccups ALOT. She's breastfed and we couldn't figure out what it was, that maybe I was eating? Sure enough today we tried it, and she's peacefully sleeping without stirring. I recomend it 110%. My husband got it at his work with a 20% discount, I'm so relieved
