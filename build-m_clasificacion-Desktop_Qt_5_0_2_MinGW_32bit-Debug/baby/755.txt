 We struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco. The first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless. I can't explain how delighted my wife and I were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby. It was better than Christmas morning when we were kids!!! We have wireless internet, cell phones, cordless phones, basically if its electronic we got it. Despite all the potential for interfence the Graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference. A must buy for any parent
