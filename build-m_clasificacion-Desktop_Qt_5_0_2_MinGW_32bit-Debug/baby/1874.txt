 I am a pharmacist and I usually don't get a scheduled lunch break, so I must pump whenever I get a free minute. I work 10 hour shifts so I sometimes need to pump twice a day. These wipes work great when in a hurry without access to the sterlizer or dishwasher. I still sterilize the pump every night and morning before I go to work, but they have saved me lots of time during my lunch break so I can actually eat instead of trying to handwash and dry each piece at work
