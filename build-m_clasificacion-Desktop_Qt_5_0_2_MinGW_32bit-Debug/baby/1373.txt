 We have used these tents with both of our sons since they learned how to climb (or fall as the case may be) out of their cribs on their own at 18 months of age. Now, we know they are safe and secure and totally happy "camping" in their cribs. We do have traditionally designed cribs, so attachment issues have not been a problem and we are able to lower the moveable side of their cribs with little difficulty. We have had to do a little needlework on one of the tents as the mesh separated from the edging material attached to the crib. But it was a one time repair and is holding up well. We did have to anchor the zipper to one of the velcro straps after each boy learned how to open the zippers on their own. We initially used a ribbon loop under the tent pole end and later utilized a carabiner clip and the velcro strap for more easy access. We always bring the tents with us on vacation if we will be using standard cribs. Love this product and the safety it provides to the boys
