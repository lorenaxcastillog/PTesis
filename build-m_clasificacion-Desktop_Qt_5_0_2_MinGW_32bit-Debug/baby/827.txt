 We've had this toy for around 3 years now. My second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn! It is also a hit with other children visiting our house. The toy is as educational as it is fun! We've used it to practice colors, shapes, and musical creativity. It can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~$20 new. All in all a FANTASTIC toy well worth the price! Another upside is how friendly and helpful the Neurosmith company is. We lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement. My friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much
