 The "Breathe Safe Padded Sheet" also left a mesh imprint on my baby's face. Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine: 1) Untying bumper guard & moving it out of the way 2) Struggling to "pull" out heavy mattress from crib 3) Removing & washing sheet & mattress pad 4) Wiping off mattress with soap & water 5) Replacing sheet & mattress pad 6) Returning heavy mattress to crib 7) Re-arranging dust ruffle 8) Re-tying bumper guard Other than that, it seemed like a good idea. Searching for a better product.
