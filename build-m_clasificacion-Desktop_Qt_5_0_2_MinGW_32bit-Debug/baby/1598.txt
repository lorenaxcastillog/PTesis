 I bought these bottles when I knew my son would have to be away from me and need to get breast milk by bottle. He had no problems going from my nipple to these and I liked that you could get all the air out of the bottle. Now that my son is on formula I do find it difficult to prepare it in these bottles. It is almost easier to put it in a seperate cup and mix the water and formula. It can be done it the bottle but it is a little difficult to mix it well. I have now mastered how to put the formula in and how long to shake it but it took some practice to get it right without the formula clumping a lot. Warming the bottles is also a problem since you cannot microwave the liners (or so it says) my mother did it once without realizing you aren't supposed to and nothing bad happened but since it advises against it, I wouldn't recommended trying it out. Now that my son doesn't really care for warm milk it isn't an issue anymore anyway. I still love these bottles and the fact that if I have enough nipples to change out, I don't have to worry about having a "clean" bottle on hand since I can just drop in a new liner. I currently have about 6 extra nipples in case this happens but it hasn't yet but it is nice to know that the option is there for us.
