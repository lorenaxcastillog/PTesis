 I own this seat for my son who is age 6. It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8. The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable. The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck. The price is decent too. The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders. If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car, the cupholders aren't very usable. Additionally, the cupholders don't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat. Personally, I leave the cupholders pushed in. I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat. I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such. Furthermore, with booster seats in general, I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat. My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium. I would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child. Not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side. As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt, this is a nice option.
