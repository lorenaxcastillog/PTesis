 i bought this set because it was something different. normally people paint the walls blue and buy things that have the colr blue everywhere when they are having a boy. and the zanzibar is different it has animals everywhere and i love the color. the material is great and all the extra pieces that the crib set has make your nursery come alive. everytime i walk into my sons nursery i think i coundnt have pick a better theme. and now they came out with the play yard and feeding chair. which i plan to purchase.
