 Our baby was born in early October and we put the Bundleme on her carrier immediately. We live in Chicago and have had warm weather (75 degrees) and cold weather (10 below) since then. We love this cover. The top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall. It also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days. The day when it was 10 below freezing, she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit. I was concerned for her warmth, but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be. We have not had to buy a winter jacket. It has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms. I have gotten numerous compliments on this cover (almost every time we take her out) and it still looks like new, even though many things have gotten spilled on it. I would highly recommend this product
