 I purchased the mini co-sleeper for my first child. She slept in it at our bedside until she was 6 months old. I really feel that her being beside me helped us all sleep better. If she woke up and was fussing, I could just reach over and pat her, find her pacifier, etc. without having to get out of bed and walk to the nursery every time. Often I could comfort her before she really got good and awake/upset and I could get her back to sleep faster. At 6months, she was getting too large for it, so I transitioned her to her own crib in the nursery with no problem. The only drawback is that it is not very easy to fold up for travel-I had to get my husband to do it for me every time. BUT, I have yet to find a portable crib that is very easy to fold up (we have a Pack and Play too). When you do get it folded up and put into its carrying case, it doesn't take up that much room. Can be used as a co-sleeper by the parent's bed or as a free-standing bassinet. Overall, I have been pleased and will use it again with my next baby
