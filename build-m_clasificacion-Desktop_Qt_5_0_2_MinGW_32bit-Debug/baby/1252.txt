 I used diaper genie with my last child it was horrid! This diaper dekor is a wondeful must have product! I would recomend it to every parent looking for a disposal system. There really are no diaper smells, it holds tons of diapers and is easy to use. Get this my husband changes the bag for me as well as using it to dispose of diapers. I mainly chose it due to the great reviews, believe them this is the best system out there. I hear the bigger one is great too, I bought this smaller model due to limited space in my house and figured it would add nicely to my bathroom once baby is out of diapers
