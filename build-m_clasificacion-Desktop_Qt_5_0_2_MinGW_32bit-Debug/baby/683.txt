 This is such a versatile chair - love the way you can fold it down compactly, yet it's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used. The tray stores on the back legs when not in use - nice touch. For the reviewer who complained that the "thing that separates the legs" is attached to the tray - you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray... Plus it's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up. My 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray - terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime
