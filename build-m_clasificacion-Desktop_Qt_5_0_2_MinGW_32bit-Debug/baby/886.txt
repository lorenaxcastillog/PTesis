 This is my third child and third infant car seat. This was the most expensive, but worth the money. The padding keeps the baby's head from that scary 90 degree flop; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids; the straps don't get twisted and it's much easier to get in and out of the car. It's the same weight as the others (which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry). The only thing I don't like is it does not fit on shopping carts. Worth the money
