 I use the mirror on my front windshield, so I can keep my rearview mirror on the road, and it hasn't fallen a time. I have a larger mirror that attaches to the back seat, where I can see my baby, and she can see herself. The seat protector is saving my leather, and I've had no issues at all with the sunshades. This is a great value for $9.99, as a seat protector alone costs about $13.00. If this stuff was all purchased separately, you'd pay about $30. I'm very pleased with this purchase
