 This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move. We use cloth wipes it has burned a few, smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it (never happened with any of our other wipes warmers) won't stay closed. It actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it. Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table. GET a different warmer this one is awful
