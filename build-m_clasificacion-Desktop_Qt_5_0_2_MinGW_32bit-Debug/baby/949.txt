 Wow! This is the best thing I received for my baby. It has saved me sooo much time. I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this. I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit. We just never use them. I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller. She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy. When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller. It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination. She never felt the cold! It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats.
