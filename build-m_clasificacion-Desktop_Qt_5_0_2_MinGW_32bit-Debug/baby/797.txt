 We really like our Graco digital iMonitor. It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes, and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously. We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box--usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block, depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries. The lights that light up for baby's sound are quite bright, which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake
