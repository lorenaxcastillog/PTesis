 [...] it def. is...very sturdy, doesn't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too :) i'm very happy with this chair - the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms...i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders. i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse...my son hasn't gotten food under there yet...i can't wait to use it as a booster seat :
