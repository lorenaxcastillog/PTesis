 I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one
