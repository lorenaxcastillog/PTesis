 We recently ordered this monitor and really like it. It has wonderful color during the day and is clearly illuminated up to about 8 feet away from the camera at night. We have a 900 MHz & 2.4 GHz phones in our home and have not had any interference problems with the monitor. We have an older two-story home and the nursery is on the top floor. I can do laundry in the basement or cook in the first floor kitchen and both the sound and picture are clear. I especially like the time-out feature that turns off the display screen after a few minutes but leaves the audio monitor on when the monitor is operating on its battery. The display is turned on by a big button on top so if you hear something that you want to check out, just push the button and the room is in view. It's very nice. The monitor has a belt clip and also a flip-out stand so that it is stable on a counter or wherever. I would recommend this product without reservation.
