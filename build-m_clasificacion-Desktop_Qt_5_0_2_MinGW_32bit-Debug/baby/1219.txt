 This Urban Bundle Me is one of the best baby items I've bought for my son! It's much more convenient than struggling to keep a blanket on the car seat. And if baby gets too warm just unzip the cover off! I like this version much better than the Original Bundle Me, which seems like it would get too warm for my baby. The material of the Urban Bundle Me is warm enough for rainy Washington weather but not too warm like the fleece in the Original Bundle Me. I also love the little pocket where I can store an emergency pacifier or other small items. It washes great and I plan to buy the larger toddler size once my son outgrows this. One minor problem is the zipper occasionally gets stuck, but that's to be expected when a zipper isn't zipped in a straight line. =)
