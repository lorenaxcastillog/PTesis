 don't buy this sheet!! it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper! spit up would go right through it. i have a much better solution for you--buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play. they are a couple of $$ less and are sold as "especially for baby"(which is B-R-US house brand). they are great. i use them for both my son's crib and for the pack n play. they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern
