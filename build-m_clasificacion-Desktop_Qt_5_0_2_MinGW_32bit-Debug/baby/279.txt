 I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain: To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case. So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system.
