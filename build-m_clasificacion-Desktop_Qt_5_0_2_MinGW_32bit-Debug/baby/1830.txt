 We used the Floppy Seat for a couple of years when our daughter was young. It was extremely easy to use. No, I didn't usually install it with one hand while holding my daughter (although I did a few times - it's not that hard); I normally parked near a cart, put the cover on & ran the belt through, THEN took my daughter out of her car seat & placed her in the shopping cart. (Why carry your baby & heavy diaper bag through the parking lot if you don't need to! :-) ) It was a bit stiff to get into the stuff sack at first, but after one or two washings, it was a cinch to put it in the stuff sack when we were finished using it. It fit all the shopping carts we used, including the oversized ones at Costco. It's held up well to repeated washings - a bit faded, but still looking fairly bright. There was hardly a time that we went shopping that someone didn't come over & say "Oh! I wish we'd had one of those when my children were small". Overall, we were very pleased with this product
