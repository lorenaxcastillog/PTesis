 1) Like others here, my charges do not last more than 5 hours. The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger). 2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly. "Cycling" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing. Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal. Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated. My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story "box" type arrangement. The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen. So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery. Poorly designed (operator interface, controls, directions and trouble-shooting), poorly engineered (poor reception, enormous static, fast battery drain) and poorly manufactured (apparent faulty parts and lack of quality) product
