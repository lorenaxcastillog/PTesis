 I can't find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter, but this tub looks most like it. I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub, but that didn't work at all. The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go. My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all. It is a pain to blow the tub up, but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook, so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall. My daughter is nearly 1 year old now, and has been using this tub for about 5 months. There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she'll be using this tub for awhile. I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub
