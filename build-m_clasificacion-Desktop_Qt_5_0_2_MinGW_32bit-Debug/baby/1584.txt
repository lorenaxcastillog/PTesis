 I used this for my daughter starting when she was only a few weeks old, and she loved it! She would just lay there and look at all of the colors. Later on, it really helped with her hand-eye coordination as she tried to hit the toys or grab them. The bars unsnap easily to put the pad in the washing machine, and the toys are easy to rotate. It's also easy to travel with, the bag it comes in is durable enough to use as a storage case, which helps keep it clean. This would be a great gift for a baby shower
