 I've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I'm still nursing my little girl. I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day. At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast, suction isn't enough. Then I got the Easy Expression Hands-free Bustier which has solved that problem. I can now do e-mail, talk on conference calls, etc. while I'm pumping so I don't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk. I'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler, with the ice pack so I don't think the cooler is too small. Also, I don't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack. If you don't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there's no problem with storage in the backpack. I also reccomend the Medela Micro-Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work. Also, I don't think the suction is too hard...yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced, but it is by no means painful. Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth!
