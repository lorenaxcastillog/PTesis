 I have used lots of different bottles with my two kids. These bottles were by far the very best at venting to keep the air at a minimum in the babies tummy. Yes, they are a pain to wash but after switching to Evenflo glass bottles due to the plastic bottle scare currently in the news I have had tons of problems with Evenflo nipples. I have bought three different packages and all have at least one defective nipple in the package (they are not venting and the nipple collapes- supposedly they are designed not to do this). Evenflo is supposed to be sending me one replacement package but it still hasnt arrived! I havent told them yet about two more packages of nipples that also contain defective nipples. With all the pains of nipples collapsing while using glass bottles from Evenflo I think I would rather just go through the pain of washing the Dr Browns (our pediatrician said she had no concerns about the plastic bottle scares). I have never had a problem before with nipples collapsing in the Dr Browns or the Avent bottles I have used. Stay away from Evenflo as their Quality Assurance department is not even close to Dr Browns
