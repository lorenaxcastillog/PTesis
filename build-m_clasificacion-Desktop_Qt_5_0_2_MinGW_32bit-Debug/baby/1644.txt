 I searched for months before buying this seat for my daughter. I read lots of reviews on the internet and had a hard time deciding if I should spend $219 on this seat of just buy a cheaper one. I am so happy that I went ahead a spent the extra money. This seat is SO worth it. The print is great and the fabric is very easy to clean. My daughter loves to snack in the car and can make quite a mess. I just vacuum the crumbs occassionally and wipe down any other messes with a damp cloth. The restraint design is great and very easy to access and use. The straps have never gotten twisted or tangled like some other cheaper seats do. I used this seat in the rear-facing position for about 3 months until my daughter was big enough to turn forwards. It was very easy to use in this position as well. I love the button you push to loosen the straps and it was still easy to use even in the rear facing position (this is a problem in some other convertible seats). I have a Nissan Maxima and the seat fit very well both front and rear-facing in this relatively small car. I highly recommend this product!!
