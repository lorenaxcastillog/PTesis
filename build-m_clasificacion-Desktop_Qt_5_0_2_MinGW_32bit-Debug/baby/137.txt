 I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!
