 Unlike the other reviews, I find these bags easy to use and convenient. The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump. The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose. The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside. I store the bags upright (just in case, although I've never had a leaky bag) in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us (the First Years brand). Once they are frozen, I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk. When I am ready to defrost, I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes, and them pour into bottles. My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding, but I really wanted her to have breastmilk. She is 2 1/2 months old now, and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old. I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively, so I pump about 5 times a day. I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week!!! I pump way more than she eats, so I have a lot of stored milk. Plently for when I go back to work and can't pump as often. Take it from someone who really knows. These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe. If they were, I wouldn't use them considering how often I need to use them.
