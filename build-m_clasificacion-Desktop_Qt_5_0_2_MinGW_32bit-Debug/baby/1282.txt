 I received this as a shower gift and I love it! I had a front carrier with my son 8 years ago, but it killed my back after 20 - 30 mins. So, I had sworn off of them, but everyone swears by this thing these days. When I was asked if I wanted one, I wasn't so sure but wanted to try it out. Now, I have been using it for the past 3 mos. and my baby girl loves it. We both have been really pleased. She goes to sleep in this thing everytime I put her in it. So, I guess it's comfortable to her too! And, I have been shopping for groceries and have gone to the mall with this on and I know I was shopping for way longer than 30 mins. No back pain!! It's fabulous! I recommend it to any parent!!
