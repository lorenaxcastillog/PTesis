 I've had this bag for well over a year now. I have a toddler and a preschooler and it works just fine to carry their stuff and mine for everyday outings. It has also held up well. I've washed it a few times and it comes out looking very good. I really like the separate compartments which make it much easier to find that one little thing. I like the pockets on the front strap for a cell phone and a nuk. So nice to have those right at hand. I also like the fact that it goes across the body...no more hitting my daughter with the diaper bag when I lean down to pick her up. The bottle holder thing is very small, so I don't really use it.
