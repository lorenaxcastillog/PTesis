 We love the swaddle me blankets. We have the flannel and the fleece. This has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night (in just two weeks of using them). She loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again. With the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer. The fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat. Have not tried the cotton ones. Definitely worth a try
