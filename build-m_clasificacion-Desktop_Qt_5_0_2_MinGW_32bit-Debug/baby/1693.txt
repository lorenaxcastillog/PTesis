 I have been using the My Brest Friend pillow for three months and I LOVE IT! It is so secure and never slips or slides like the Boppy pillow or traditional pillows do. The cover comes off and can be machine washed, but does have to hang to dry, which is annoying, but still not enough for me to take a star away. MBF is also nice and firm, which I find a big advantage over the Boppy. I cannot recommend this pillow enough-I will be buying it for all of my friends who plan to breast feed
