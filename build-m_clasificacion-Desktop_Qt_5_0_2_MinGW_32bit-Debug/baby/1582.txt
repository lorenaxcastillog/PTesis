 I looked into these bottles because I was going on a camping trip and wanted to make life easier on me. I was using the Dr. Brown bottles but they are such a pain to clean especially if your camping. I read some reviews on these bottles and heard they were better then the Dr. Brown bottles so I tried them out. my son was still spitting up a little with the Dr. Brown bottles but now he dosen't spit up at all! I am sold on these bottles. I would say the liners are kind of a pain only because you have to buy extra and you have to make sure you have extra in your diaper bag. But it is worth the change in my son!
