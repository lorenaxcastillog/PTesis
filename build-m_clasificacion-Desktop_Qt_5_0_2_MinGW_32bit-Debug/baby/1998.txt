 I absolutely love this stroller because of its size and weight. It is very light and has just enough pockets to hold a few diapers and wipes along with a few toys on the other side. The cup holder on top is a nice addition too. It is very easy to manage and fits perfectly in my wife's trunk, taking up very little space. My only real complaint is the canopy. It is undersized and flimsy. The only way it blocks the sun is if it is directly overhead at noon. Otherwise, the canopy is pretty much useless because the sun is always in our little girls' eyes. All in all, I'd recommend this due to enough features and easy of use to overcome the canopy issue.
