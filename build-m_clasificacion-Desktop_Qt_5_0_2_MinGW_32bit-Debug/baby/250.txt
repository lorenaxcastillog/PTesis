 It's not just the most icredible piece of junk I ever seen, it is the most DANGEROUS piece of junk I ever seen on the market for kids. The plastic is very thin, very weak and bends every each way. My daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight. Is SLIDES off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child's weight, which really frightened my girl. There's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat. I feel soooo stupid to have bought it((
