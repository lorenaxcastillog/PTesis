 After searching and searching for the "perfect" car seat (that was still affordable) we found the Graco Snugride. It is easy to install, after you buckle the seatbelt just make sure you pull your seatbelt all the way out until you hear your "autolock" kick in and then slowly release the seatbelt back in. Once it is back in your seatbelt will hold the seat in place without the testher strap. My daughter has been using this car seat for 6 months now and I haven't had an issue with it. It's easy to take in and out of the base with or without my daughter in it. I love the 5 point safety points on it, it makes me feel like she is truly as safe as she can be, and as she grows it is easy to adjust the straps
