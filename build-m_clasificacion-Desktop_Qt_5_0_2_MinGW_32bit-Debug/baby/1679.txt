 This item was well loved in our family. I want to go ahead and state my only disappointment with it though & that was the fact that it took a lot of elbow grease to collapse it for travel or storage. It was very stiff & always became my husband's job. He didn't like to do it either, by the way. Otherwise it was great to have & I was able to use it until my daughter was 8 months old (by then she could crawl out so it was not safe to use). It was nice to have her close for the middle of the night breastfeedings. And since we only have a queen bed, it was good to be able to put her into it after a feeding so my husband & I could have more room in the bed. Finally, for the middle of the night diaper changes or clothes changes (my daughter was a HUGE spitter upper) it was wonderful to have everything right there where I needed it. It was like a second changing table. I used it as a changing table while I was sitting on the bed. If I was standing, it was uncomfortably low. I had to bend down too much. (I'm 5'10") One more thing-it's great for when your baby wants to nap. I rolled it close to the window when she was a newborn so she could get some sunlight to help rid her of jaundice.
