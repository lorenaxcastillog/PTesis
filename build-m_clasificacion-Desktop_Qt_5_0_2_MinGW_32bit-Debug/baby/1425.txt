 I bought this for my not-yet-4-month-old daughter and it arrived yesterday. I put it together with ease (except being short one battery that I stole from a clock in the house). She has been holding her head up since birth and doesn't like laying down anymore. She loved sitting in this and looking at the toys. She's just now realizing her hands are hers to use so the toys on this are perfect. Her toes barely touch the floor and so she can't quite jump in it. But at her rate of growth, she will be jumping in a few days! Another reviewer mentioned placing a pillow under the baby's feet and I think I'll try that tonight. With that said, I still wish I bought this sooner. If you are thinking about buying it, don't wait until your baby is older. Buy it sooner and get your monies worth. Even if the baby can't reach the floor, there is great value in the toys. So far, so good. Although she is deeply interested in this new toy and trying to figure out what to do in it, I just LOVE it! I can see many hours of her enjoyment, mine watching her and valuable hands free time for me!
