 When I was pregnant with my son I received one of those big, bulky strollers as a baby shower gift, but after my son grew out of the attaching car seat he quickly grew to hate the stroller - as did I. After much research we bought the Maclaren Volo Carbon Stroller with mesh backing (we live in Florida so the mesh was perfect for our climate) and I am sure I will never own another stroller. I remember cringing as I spent the $100 but we now joke that it was the best $100 we ever spent. It really was. We have traveled all over the country with the stroller - it's lightweight, extremely collapsable and comes with a shoulder strap that was a genious addition. The wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers, it can take a beating and still keep going. At 4 years and 42 lbs it still carried my son without a squeek. (Ok we did WD-40 the wheels once in the 4 years we had it.) The mesh backing made cleaning the stroller a breeze. It can easily be steered with one hand, and we personally loved the shape of the handles and the handle padding - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now. The basket underneath is incredibly handy and carries a surprising amount. It folds easily with one hand and foot. My son doesn't use a stroller anymore but the Volo still looks and works perfectly so we are saving it for our next child. Bottom line, this stroller is worth every penny you pay for it. The ONE and only complaint I have about the stroller is that it would be nice if the seat reclined for younger infants. If you are thinking about purchasing this stroller for younger infants consider spending the extra $ for the model that does recline. A sun visor might be something to consider too
