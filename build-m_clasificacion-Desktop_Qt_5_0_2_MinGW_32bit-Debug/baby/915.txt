 Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all. At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used. So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over. We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one. WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this! Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep. He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks. We would never have this success without this blanket. We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it. It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts. And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB. I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents.
