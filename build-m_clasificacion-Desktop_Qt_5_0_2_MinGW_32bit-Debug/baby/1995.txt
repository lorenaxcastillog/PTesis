 Our 3 weeks old son had a really bad diaper rash. we tried a different product called balmex but it was so greasy and it didn't seem to work very well. We then tried the butt paste and within a week his butt color went from red to white. It looked like what a normal baby butt would look like. It has no smell and it is not greasy. It is usually gone by the next time you change the diaper. I totally recommend using this product
