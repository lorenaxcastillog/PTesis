 We used Avent with our first son almost 5 years ago. I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle. I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely. After figuring this out, we had no more problems. We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again. Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems. Of course he was gassy at times, so I can't say he had no gas, but he didn't appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him. I really liked the wide bottle with Avent. It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold. Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves. The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands. The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard, but our son never had any problems taking it. Of course, this will vary amoung babies. After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby #2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for "extra soft nipple" and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago. If you are looking to save money, I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly. We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well. We never had to replace them.
