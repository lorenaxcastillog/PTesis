 When we bought this item I was going to use it in our bed as a co-sleeper for nursing. As it turned out I did not nurse. We were having our cradle worked on and our son was 3 weeks early so his bed was not ready when he came home, the snuggle nest was a life saver. His is almost 7 weeks old and he still sleeps in it. It is so wonderful I take it to the daycare everyday and we put it in the play pen where he sleeps. It has been on day and overnight trip to grandma's house and he sleeps so wonderful because it is his bed.This item is very easy to travel with. This was the best item I bought. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was this. The actual bed has two layers that are not attached. When both layers are put in like they are suppose to be the baby sleeps at an inclined position. After about two weeks our son started wiggling and could wiggle all the way to the bottom where there were no side protectors and he could fall out. The way I fixed this is to pull the bottom layer down a little so he was not inclined and laid flay and that fixed the problem of him wiggling out. Other than that I love this product!!!
