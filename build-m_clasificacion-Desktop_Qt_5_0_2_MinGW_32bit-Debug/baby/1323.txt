 Check to see if the crib or play-yard you intend this for will actually work with it. When mine didn't, I decided to attach it (secure and safe) to my headboard. Curious about reports that it's not loud enough, I laid down and had a listen. It's plenty loud enough, even at a distance of 2.5 feet overhead. Remember, your infant hasn't spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert! When the baby (9 weeks old) finally got a shot at it, he was enchanted, stimulated, very excited. So much for soothing -- but it's wonderful to know that while I'm having to fold laundry he's watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music. A great addition to the day with baby..
