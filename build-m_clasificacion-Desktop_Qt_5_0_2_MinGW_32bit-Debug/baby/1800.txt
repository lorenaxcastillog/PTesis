 We used this carrier while on a trip to Florida. It was very convenient to use and wheel through the airport since we dont check the carseat so we can use it on the plane. Since the bag as 2 zippers on it, we were actually able to leave my sleeping daughter in the car seat in the bag with the zippers part way down in each side so her face was out. This way I didnt have to carry a sleeping baby and by other bags through the aiirport- I just pulled her along in the car seat since it has wheels. She fell asleep in her carseat while on the plane and didnt wake up until after we got off the plane, picked up our baggage, got our rental car, and put her car seat in the car and were traveling to our destination. We also have used the Eddie Bauer bag on a past trip - the strap broke while carrying it through the airport and it doesnt have wheels so it was much more difficult to carry.
