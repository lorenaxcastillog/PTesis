 I love this Item. It was a life saver. At around 4-6 weeks, my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding. Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a "No, No" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS. I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it. I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another "no, no" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro. And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night. He's 4 months old now and we're still using them.... Buy a few, because if we wets himself, which boys do a lot, you'll need another one to switch him into
