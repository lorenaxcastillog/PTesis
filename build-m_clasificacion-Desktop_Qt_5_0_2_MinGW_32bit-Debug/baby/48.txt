 I like the music, but we have to have it on auto to play. Because I have a mirror in the seat to see my son(he is still backward facing), I can't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on. Also, I have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim. So just music plays. There are plenty of other smaller items that can do that. This thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe. I am changing them every couple of days, and we aren't in the car much. What a disappointment!! Good concept, but doesn't work well at all
