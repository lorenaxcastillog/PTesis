 let me start by saying I have twins that are 2.5. I have never written a review before and I wanted to do so for this item. I was reluctant to purchase a Cooshie due to the cost and purchased the hard plastic ones from Wal-mart instead. The hard plastic ones were leaving small bruises on my girls' backs right along their spine from leaning back into the hard seat. They also will rub the finish off of the seats of your hard wood chairs without putting something under them. Also the hard plastic ones are hard to clean and difficult to remove from the seats to clean under them, because crumbs will get under it and in it and around it. The cooshie is light enough that my girls can carry it around them selves and they love to sit in them to watch TV. I love the ease of being able to move the seats without unstrapping them in case we need the extra adult space. Mine came with carry bags so we can take them with us to a restaurant and not have to use the germ infested seats there. Cooshie seats are well worth the money. I plan to use ours for several years to come. They are also a breeze to clean
