 well, i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out of the crib again. he had done this months earlier, when the crib was not on the lowest setting, so that time the problem was easily solved. this time, not so easily...i was so afraid he would crack his head open on our hard mexican tile floors! many of the other moms wrote how their kids seemed to love it. wsh i could say that! i love it, because i know it is protecting my child from a potentially very harmful fall. but, he REALLY was freaked out by it the first few nights. i think it would be nice if it were to go higher up, have a higher arch, thus not making it feel so confining, so much like being caged in. so he didn't like it at all, but, it has been five or six nights now and he is used to it, and simply checks it out, then rolls over and goes to sleep. but it did cost us some tears. (i'm not talking hours here, five minutes max, on the worst night). anyways, all in all, i think it is a great product for all parents who want to protect their little monkeys from potential injuries.
