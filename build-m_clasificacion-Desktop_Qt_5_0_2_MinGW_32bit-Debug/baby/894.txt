 My husband and I received this changing table, along with the 4-drawer chest and the Monterey crib, as a gift from our parents. We were skeptical, because we wanted a nursery that was affordable, yet not too flimsy. We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together. The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery, and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood. And the nicest part is that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery. My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are. * The only reason I rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled. It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks, took 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a beautiful, quality nursery that is affordable, this is a great choice
