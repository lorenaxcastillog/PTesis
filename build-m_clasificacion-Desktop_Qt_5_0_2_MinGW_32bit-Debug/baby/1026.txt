 We chose this mattress because of its firmness (not too hard or too soft)and for its vinyl cover. We went with a higher priced option, but not over the top expensive. To be perfectly honest, we didn't know what else to look for in a crib mattress, I mean, how do you really test one. Well, our twins slept well together on one until they had to be separated into two cribs where they also slept very well. They are about 3 weeks shy of 3 years old and are still sleeping on the mattress in their toddler beds. We found that they fit the crib very well (no dangerous gaps), held up to changing and normal use. The mattresses both still look and feel new. By the way, the kids are both average sized. We are getting ready to buy another for our third child. I definitely recommend this mattress
