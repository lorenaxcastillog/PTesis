 I gave the seat itself 5 stars - I guess our car gets 3 stars :) The seat is wonderful - easy to install, good LATCH fit, foot on it to level the seat out, nice lining. Unfortunately, we are going to have to return it and get another seat for our soon-due newborn! It's too long (head to foot) to fit comfortably in our car. We don't have center LATCH points, so it has to go behind a seat. The car seat is so long, that once it is installed and at an appropriate level for a newborn, the seat in front of it has to be almost completely upright and pushed forward more than is comfortable for a 5'7" person. For reference, we have a 2003 Subaru Forester. Before you buy this seat, see if you can find a friend that has one...check it out in your car to make sure it fits! I didn't expect it to be a problem - it wasn't with our first child's seat that was smaller. So, the benefit of this carseat (rear facing to 30 lbs!) could be it's downfall for you if you don't have a large vehicle
