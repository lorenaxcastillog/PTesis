 I recieved this warmer as a Christmas gift when my daughter was a month old. I think its great!! I haven't had trouble with the wipes getting dry....but for those who have, please note the owners manual which says to add some water to keep the wipes from getting dry. No, the wipes don't stay warm for long but the idea of this product is to take the chill off the wipes, not make them hot. I don't have any complaints with this product and I have recommended it to seveal of my friends. I feel it is a definite must have
