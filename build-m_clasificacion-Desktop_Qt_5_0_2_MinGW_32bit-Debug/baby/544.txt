 This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a "bunkie" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a "big boy" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)
