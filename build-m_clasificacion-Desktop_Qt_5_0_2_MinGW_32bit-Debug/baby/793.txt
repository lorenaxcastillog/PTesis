 I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking. It is perfect for my girl. I do understand why people with boys may have issues, but if you have a girl it is just wonderful. I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better. It has a great weight to it so it's not flimsy, and it fits my girls bum so nicely, and the cushion is very firm yet soft. The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool, sit and pull herself back. My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice, I saved $15 on something that works just as well
