 I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.
