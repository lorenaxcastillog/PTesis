 I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one
