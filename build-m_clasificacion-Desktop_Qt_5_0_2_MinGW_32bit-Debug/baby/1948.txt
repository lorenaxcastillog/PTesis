 I have 6 1/2 month old twins, so needless to say, I need all the help I can get. I have found the Hip Hammock FAR easier and more comfortable than the sling style carrier. I have had such a great experience with this that I'm getting a second one to keep sized for my husband so we can both carry a baby at the same time - for walks or other outings, or even just around the house. I highly recommend this product. It is very easy, and very comfortable
