 If you have an ipod or mp3 player, I'd recommend getting this. I think the baby is going to love it! I bought it last week, and tested it out (our baby hasn't been born yet). The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby's crib or room IMO, and I'm 1/2 deaf. I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color. My only criticism is that it takes batteries (no AC adapter). We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly. For $20, I think it's great
