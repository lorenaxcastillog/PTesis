 I nursed my now 4-year-old daughter for almost a year and pumped daily. I hated always having to boil the pump for 20 minutes, which was also tough on the pump's plastic parts, which would yellow until I replaced them. Now I am nursing my 3-month-old son. I was thrilled to find these micro-steam bags! I use them not only to sterilize the pump after each use, but also for bottles. (Though I pump daily, I only occasionally use bottles, so always boiled them, too - this is sooooooo much easier!) I am so glad they came out with this product - it just makes things a lot easier! And it's so inexpensive, too!
