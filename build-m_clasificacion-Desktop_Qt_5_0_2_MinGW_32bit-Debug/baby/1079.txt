 I used this stroller for the first time yesterday, and I can't say enough good things about it. I also have a Graco Quattro and a Macleran Volo, and the BOB is definitely the most versatile stroller of the three. I can steer it with one hand while handling my dog with the other hand. Jogging with the stroller is a breeze, as are the basic functions of the stroller. I assembled it with no problem, and it's very easy to fold and unfold. It weighs about the same as the Graco and stores similarly to the Graco. My son loved the Graco, but I found it hard to handle and I couldn't run with it. He hates the Volo b/c he can't sit up in it. Although the BOB is more similar to the Volo than the Graco as far as the seating position goes, my son doesn't seem to mind it. I think it supports him well. It has plenty of storage, and I also purchased the handle bar console. The orange color is nice, with a brown contrast. I live in Minnesota, and this thing plows through the snow without any problem. I'm very happy with this purchase.
