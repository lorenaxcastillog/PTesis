 I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6&quot; and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby
