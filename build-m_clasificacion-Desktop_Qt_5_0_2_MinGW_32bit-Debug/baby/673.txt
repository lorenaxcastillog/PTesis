 First, I must say that this sling was an absolute LIFESAVER when my (somewhat colicky) son was a newborn. No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it. Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it. One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded. I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder. In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder. Good use for a mitten that's lost it's mate, but I would rather have a better strap
