 I love thi sling for many reasons but the top three are the following: 1) my baby calms down right away when she's carried in it. 2) she doesn't get scared of strangers when we visit new people or go to a party (she's in the middle of the stranger anxiety phase). 3) Most of all it helps nursing really discretely in public without ovrheating my baby. Before Itried to use all kinds of blankets and scarves but my baby was getting so swaty and hot. instead the fabric of maya wraps is very breathable and my baby remains at a comfortable temperature, even in Texas
