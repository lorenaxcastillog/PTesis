 I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store. The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover. The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover. The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck. I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece. If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great
