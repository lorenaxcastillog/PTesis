 We had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to Disney World came. To be honest I didn't know what to do because she wouldn't go potty on the big potty. I felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her. A full week at Disney World was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around. Then I found this at babies r us!!! What a little blessing to little ones. It fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty. Plus it fit perfect in my Wendy Bellissimo diaper bag. I carry it everywhere!! I don't leave home without it. Thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to Disney World so much better!!
