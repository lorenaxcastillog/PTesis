 Love it! Love it! My 5 month old has been breastfed with an occasional bottle. I decided to move her to bottle only, and she refused any kind of bottle. I tried Avent, Playtex Nurser, Evenflo Elan, and Gerber. I even tried different flows and materials of some of these bottles. I tried them over and over again, but when I tried the Soothie, she took it the very first time and hasn't even complained. What a relief!!!! Besides being relieved that she will take the Soothie, they are also very inexpensive, which is another plus
