 I have been using a Maclaren Triumph for the past 18 months, and have been envious of all the features my friends strollers had. What my stroller was missing? - a leg rest, window through the canopy, a greater sun shade, the ability to increase the recline thoroughly, are all found with the zooper twist, plus more. I love the matching boot, and that the accessories are included. I may go ahead and order a more structured cup holder cuz I dont trust the mesh one for coffee. Also, the wheels are smaller than what you might find on a more expensive stroller, so for longer walks you may want a nicer zooper model. Other than that, it is gorgeous, and perfect for mall walking/ shorter street walks. My friends now have stroller envy of me for a change, and thats fun. ;-
