 We like this car seat for the price we paid. Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat.
