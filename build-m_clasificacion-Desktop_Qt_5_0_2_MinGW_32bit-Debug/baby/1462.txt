 Overall I love this carseat but I found out today that I have been driving around with the handle in the wrong position. I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why. The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all. I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was "tested" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash. I think I am going to believe the police officer vs. the manufacturer!
