 I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU). Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.
