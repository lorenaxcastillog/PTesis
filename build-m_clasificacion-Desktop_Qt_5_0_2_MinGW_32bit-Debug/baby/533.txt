 I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up, and not just the sides. This is also sometimes refered to as a "4-sided changing pad" since all 4 edges are raised. It seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser, effectively converting the dresser to a changing table. The only reason I didn't rate this higher was that it didn't include a non-skid pad on the bottom of the pad. Also, it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover. Next, I need to order some covers for it, since the baby doesn't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface. I am not sure which covers to order
