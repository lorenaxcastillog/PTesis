 I bought this chair for my third child and wish I would've had it for the first two as well. It is easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean. I like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age. I love the wheels because I could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner. The one hand release on the tray is a dream for Moms who could use eight hands! My son seems to enjoy the toys, too. I only wish it came with extra trays
