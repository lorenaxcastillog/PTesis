 These are absorbant diapers and they hold up to the regular abuse of washing over and over again. They need to be washed several times before they are soft. I do need to mention that if you choose to cloth diaper your baby, you might want to just use velcro covers first since the weave is very tight on this diaper. I used pins, at first, and got frustrated, because they wouldn't go through the diaper. After a few washings, the weave loosened a bit and I was able to pin them more easily
