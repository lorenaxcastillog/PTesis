 I love this stroller, and tell all of my friends about it. Our daughter was about 3 months old when I purchased it. There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched, and there still is not. You can run, walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe. Lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks, and occasional rollerblading. She is a fussy girl, (only) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat, but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB. We live in Florida, and with the sun-guard canopy, she is well covered. Some other factors which made we chose BOB: * The braking mechanism, which is hard to find, has a wrist strap which if you should fall, locks the back wheels (unlike most strollers on the market). This feature is great for rollerbladers. * 5 point safety harness * 70 pound weight limit (highest that I found) * Metal frame (others have more plastic that metal) * Shock absorbers, great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep * Swivel front wheel, which locks with a simple pin. * Simple Lily likes it, and we tried several others, all that Babies-R-Us has in stock. The cost is pretty high, but would you put a price on the safety of your child, if you were to fall while exercising? Thanks for hearing me out
