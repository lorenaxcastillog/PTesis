 This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care. The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails. The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip. I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering! The case is cumbersome and of poor design. Everytime I open it - everything falls out!
