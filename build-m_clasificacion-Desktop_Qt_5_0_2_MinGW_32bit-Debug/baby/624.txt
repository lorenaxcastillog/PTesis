 We bought this stroller for my daughters: 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds. We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again. I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like "a baby," but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc. This stroller was the answer! The front seat is perfect for our little one. The tray swings open (and comes completely off, if needed) to get her in and out easily. I was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because I didn't think a 5-point harness was necessary. The tray is large and sturdy, as is the foot rest. My older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines, but we have absolutely no problem because of it. She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break. The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller. We can store keys, snacks, cellphone, etc., plus two cups/bottles. The basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access. The side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be. The stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily. It takes very little room to store. The steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push. The stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant. The price is fantastic too. You can't beat $120 for a double stroller like this! I wish we had bought this a year ago
