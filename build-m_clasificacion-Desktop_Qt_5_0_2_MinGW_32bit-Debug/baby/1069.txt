 I purchased this pump with my second child after returning my Medela electric pump (I think it was a pump in style) to its original owner. I am staying at home with my child number 2 and only needed something for occasions. This pump seems to work great. It is obviously quiet and there is no hassle of the tubes, electrical outlet, etc. I did notice however that when used more frequently while trying to teach my 7 month old to take a bottle that it made my nipples soar. It could have just been me since I was not used to pumping that much. Other than that it is great and I plan to use it for a weekend away next month. I was concerned that my hands would get tired, but it is really easy to use! It is nice to be able to use discretely in the car as well.
