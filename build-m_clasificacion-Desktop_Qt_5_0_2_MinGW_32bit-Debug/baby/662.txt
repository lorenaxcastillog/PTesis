 I was that parent who said "I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer." And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.
