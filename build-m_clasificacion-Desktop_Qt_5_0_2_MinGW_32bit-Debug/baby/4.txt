 We have had nothing but problems with the receiver. We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom. Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal. The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way. If we open the fridge door it beeps also. We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck. It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency. When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds. The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath. If there is no movement it sounds an alarm. Great insurance against SIDS!
