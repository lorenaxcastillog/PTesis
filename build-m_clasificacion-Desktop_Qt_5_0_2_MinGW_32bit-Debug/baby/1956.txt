 Our daughter has been in this seat since she was 7 months old. It is FANTASTIC!!! She is now 3 1/2 and I recently invested another $50 into the seat. I replaced the harness and the HUGS and was fortunate to find a new cover on clearance in a children's shop in Seattle. It now looks like brand new! We use it in a 2001 Toyota Tacoma double cab, a 1996 Chevy Suburban, and a 2003 BMW X5. In the Toyota and the BMW to get proper fit we have to remove the head rests. NO PROBLEM! As for the wieght, I am ok with having to lug a heavy seat if it means my child is as best protected as she can be. When you get the seat into whatever car you want it in, my recommendation is to literally climb into the seat with one knee pushing as much of your weight into the seat as possible. We do this when installing ours and it doesn't move a millimeter...... Our daughter is always comfortable in the big cushy seat, doesn't slump when she falls asleep, can't escape from it, and I never deal with twisted straps! Well worth the money, the *inconvenience* of the weight and size. Crazy that people would spend the money on this knowing it is the safest seat and then just because it is heavy put your child in a piece of junk in another car. An accident is only going to happen in the car with the best seat?? Think again!! Take the time to do it right! If you have trouble installing it find a local fire department or insurance agency that will properly install it for you!!
