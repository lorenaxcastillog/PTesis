 This is a great distraction for little ones of any age almost, BUT, do not lose the remote! If it is misplaced, falls out of vehicle because a little one heaved it over the side like my guy does with everything, there is no way to turn it on without the remote! Both the mirror and remote use up batteries pretty quick when you let the child play with it by turning it on and off. Other than that its a wonderful sleepy time, night time distraction without letting the your child play with the remote. At night it lights up in different places on the frame softly while playing music which isn't so loud its going to keep them awake. I would buy it again or give it as a gift
