 I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily). Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend. My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me. Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced "just the pump" in the pack with a new one. Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back. Another thing that is happening is my back pack's handles have started wearing down. And I hardly carry them around. I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump. I would think twice before buying this
