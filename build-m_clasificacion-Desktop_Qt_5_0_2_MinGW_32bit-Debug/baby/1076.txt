 We swaddled our daughter forever, it worked miracles for us and she loved it. I also was so much more comfortable and at ease knowing she was bundled up nice and warm at night. Then she got too old for it and I was so irritated to just leave her in the crib with no blankets or anything. Then I saw these and I tried them out and I love them. We bought the fleece ones and they keep her so warm. She can cuddle in them if she likes and be nice and warm like she used to be in the swaddle. She seems to like them. The bottom line is that her tummy, chest, and toes are kept warm in a safe way. I highly recommend these. The fleece ones are quite warm so if you live in a warmer climate I would recommend the cotton ones
