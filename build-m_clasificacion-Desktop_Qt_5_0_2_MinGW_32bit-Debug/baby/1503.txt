 My wife and I each have seat in our car for carrying our 18-month-old toddler. She has a Britax Marathon convertible car seat. I have a Cosco Eddie Bauer Deluxe 3-in-1 car seat. Neither of us has had any problems using the Britax seat with thick harness straps that don't twist. The lap-buckle system on the Britax harness is easy to use and can be undone with one hand. The seat cover was also easy to remove when my daughter spilled juice all over her seat. In contrast, within 2 weeks using the Cosco seat and wrestling my toddler into the harness, the thin harness straps on my Cosco seat were a twisted mess, that just kept getting worst. The overlapping buckle system is a pain to line up and use. I've finally decided to give up on the Cosco seat. I got tired of trying to straighten the harness straps and to fasten the complicated buckle. I just ordered another Britax Marathon
