 I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on. In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat. The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks. Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable. I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances. Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.
