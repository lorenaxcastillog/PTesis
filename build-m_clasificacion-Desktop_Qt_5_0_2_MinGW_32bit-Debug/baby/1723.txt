 I received this as a gift and I love it. My daughter is 6 months old now and this product was so helpful during sleep training as well as those nerve racking newborn days. I can "peek in on her" with out disturbing her. When she was learning to fall asleep on her own I was able to see that she was ok without running into her room and waking her all the way up everytime she let out a cry. The monitor works all over my house includding the basement and even out in the yard. The only thing that I don't like is that it will let out a loud static sound from time to time. It is also pricey...but if you can swing it GO FOR IT!!
