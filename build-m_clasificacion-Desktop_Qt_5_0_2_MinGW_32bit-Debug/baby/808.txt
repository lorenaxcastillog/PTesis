 I also own the Bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner & we could not have lived without it! I was excited to see this trendy,light-weight, weather resistant version for spring. I'll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $39.99. My $59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional! No more struggling with bulky snowsuits, jackets and sweaters (which never seem to fit baby anyway) Easily unzips so as not to overheat. LOVE the little pocket for binky. Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller (No need to buy two!)
