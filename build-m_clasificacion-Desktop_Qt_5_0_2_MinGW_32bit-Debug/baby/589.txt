 My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!! Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now. With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already. Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!)
