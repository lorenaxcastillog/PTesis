 The stroller arrived and said nowhere on the box it was the MT so when I called to make sure we has received the stroller we ordered the service rep was QUITE nasty and kept telling me to just send it back. I LOVED the stroller and wanted to of course keep it just wanted to confirm it was the right one. Apparently that was too much to ask. I finally got a supervisor who with the click of a button could tell me there was a note for all service reps regarding this model stating it is in fact the MT it just doesn't say it on the box. That was fine and dandy but the service rep was incredibly snotty and didn't want to take anytime to bother making sure it was the correct product would have rather just had me send it back. Bad for business I'd guess. Not to mention they do have a serious issue letting people know when items are out of stock. It was IN stock when we ordered and magically out of stock the day it was to be shipped, then when I went to cancel the order via phone (48 min on hold!!) they said oh it had already shipped they couldn't cancel the order. How odd... since I had no shipping info!!! Turns out the stroller didn't ship for another WEEK and they could have easily canceled my order. I don't plan to buy the Amazon again anytime soon. The stroller however is FANTASTIC!! It folds up small, easy to use with one hand and very nice on the eyes!! Stroller gets 5 stars Amazon gets
