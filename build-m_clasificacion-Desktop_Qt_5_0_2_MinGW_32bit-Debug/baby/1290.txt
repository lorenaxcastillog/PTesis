 This gate is great. I have a very active 1 year old, who has tried to kick, climb, and pull this gate down but failed every time. This is NOT one of those cheap pressure mounted gates this gate is very sturdy, and mounts to the wall, you hear the lock click, so you can rest assured it's closed. It swing both ways, and opens with one hand. It also works great with our two Saint Bernards. This is a great gate. I highly recommend it.
