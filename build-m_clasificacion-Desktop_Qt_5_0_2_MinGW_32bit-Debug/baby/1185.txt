 My 3 year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift. The basket, canned goods, and produce pieces are very nice. The boxes, however, are very flimsy hollow cardboard and are showing wear after only three days of play, so I know they won't last long. At this price I don't expect wooden boxes, but solid cardboard construction would be a better design for the age range to which this set is marketed. My daughter likes this set very much, and I think it will give her lots of enjoyment while it lasts
