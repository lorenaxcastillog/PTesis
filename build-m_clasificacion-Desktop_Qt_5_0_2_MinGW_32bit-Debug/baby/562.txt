 I bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and I am so glad I had it! I used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller. There are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it. My daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep. She loved being able to see everything around her at our level. I am 5'3" and my husband is 6'1" and we both wore it comfortably. I would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller
