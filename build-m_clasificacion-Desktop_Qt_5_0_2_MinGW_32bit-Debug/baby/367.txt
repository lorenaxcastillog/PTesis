 We have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib...and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us. We were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us. So now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor. If you live out in the middle of no where or you don't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you
