 I got this tray for my son's daily rides in the car, and it has been terrific! He can eat on it, put his sippy cup into the cup holder, and be totally independent. He can also play on it - cars, crayons, etc., and it holds his books too. After approximately 9 months of constant use, it cracked. (It is very stiff, of course, but I don't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked). Worth the money as far as I am concerned.
