 We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago. For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips. We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage. The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well
