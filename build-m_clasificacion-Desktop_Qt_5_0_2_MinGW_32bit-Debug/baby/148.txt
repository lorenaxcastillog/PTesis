 As with all other reviews, our gate worked well for a while then the latch broke as well. There is no way to fix it. The company did nothing to help us with the situation, except to suggest that we buy an whole new one. No thanks! I would encourage anyone who has purchased this gate to send your complaints to the company, as I am doing. Though the company says they have made improvements to the product, the gates are still breaking and should be recalled. Their representative told me there is no reason to recall the gates since it is not a safety issue, however, they advertise its use for the top of stairs! I called The First Years, and they said to send your complaints to: Judy Paulette RC2 The First Years 100 Technology Center Dr. Suite 2A Stoughton, MA 02072
