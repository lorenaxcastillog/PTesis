 The minute we opened the box i knew i made the right desicion to purchase this stroller. The weight is unbelieveable, the ride is smooth - ONE FINGER push is what it takes! My 7 mos. old baby girl looked very comfortable in it, recline is pretty good for an infant (a 2 hr nap is the proof). My previous purchase of Britax Blue Blaze (sold it on craigs list the day after we received it) was a big mistake. Spend a little more the get whole a lot. A good stroller is a good investment
