 I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily. I didn't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space, but they are also very heavy. This stroller is light, and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand. Plus, because my kids are heavy enough to push, I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller. Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door. My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems. The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing, but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down, so you can angle them with the sun. I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger, more expensive, heavier tandem stroller
