 All of Medela products (nursing pads, lanolin, bras, pumps, etc...) are definitely the best that I've tried (and I've tried most all mainstream brands). This bra in particular is EXTREMELY comfortable on sore nipples. I have sensitive skin and nipples and I found this to be the best there is (Bravado was too rough for me as were some other night nursing bras I tried). The material is sort of a pantyhose type of material where when you slip it on, it feels as though there's nothing there but it protects and supports your sensitive breasts (especially important during the first several weeks of first time nursing). It's not really a bra that you'd want to wear on an evening out as it's more of a sports type bra and it would not support adequately for high impact activities (like aerobics, etc...) but it's perfect for around the house or errand running or low impact activities such as yoga. As a larger breasted women (especially breast feeding - I went from a 36DD to a 36G), this bra works perfectly for me for support and comfort. It's a MUST HAVE for anyone who is breastfeeding
