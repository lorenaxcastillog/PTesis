 I have not been pleased with high chairs in the past- they were bulky and took up way too much space. This high chair went right on one of my dining room chairs- no more tripping over the awkwardly large, inconvienent high chair. This high chair is easy to clean and it reclines for the infant who can't quite sit up yet. It turns into a booster so when my baby gets bigger he can literally "eat at the table." I highly recommend this for all!!
