 I purchased the stroller sight unseen, no one around here has it in stock yet. I have a 20 month old and a 7 month old. YES, it is STILL heavy, but Graco never claimed it was LIGHTER, just more COMPACT, so I just figure it will help tone my arms up! It gets around great! The only two things I found I would change on the stroller are 1) the cupholders are small in diameter and do not accomodate most of my sons sippy cups....and 2) I have a hard time lowering the cargo basket, maybe its just my model? I received the stroller with the brake shattered, but called Graco and they immediately sent a replacement free of charge.... great cust service. I'd spend the money again
