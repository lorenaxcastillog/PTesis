 This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins. Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls. We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features. The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet. Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up. I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night. This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a "U" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again. As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head. I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib. Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you. One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature. I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings
