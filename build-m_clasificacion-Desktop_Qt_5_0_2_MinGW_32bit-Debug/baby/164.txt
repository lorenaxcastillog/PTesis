 well lets see i ordered this product for my sons birthday ...which by the way was on the 14th of january. well i think its the 2nd of feb. still hadn't received it, but i did get a CHAIR..??? Anyway so i called and canceled when i got the chair, the money was never placed back into my account, i was told it would be put in on a monday so tuesday i felt safe writing a check that would include that money...and my bank went overdrawn for like 200 dollars..in fees (i realize it was my fault for believing a reputable company like amazon!) . now its been a month and i call youall back and you say that it should be sent out to me this week, though this is the only email i get from you....how should i rate the damn table when i havent recieved it....i mean put yourself in my situaition...how would you rate it
