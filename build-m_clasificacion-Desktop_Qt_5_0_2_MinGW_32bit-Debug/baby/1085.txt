 Both of our children have been in Marathons since they outgrew their infant carriers and we have been extremely happy with both seats. We have found them to be far more user-friendly than other seats we have used and even though our daughter is now able to use a booster seat, we continue to keep her in the Marathon. Convenience aside, mom ran a red light and t-boned a Montero last month. The Montero was totaled, our tank-like Range Rover sustained over $8K in damage. Our son was in his Marathon and when Mom turned around to make sure he was okay, he gave her a big toothy grin. Not one single peep or tear from the little guy! When insurance offered to replace the seats, we went straight back to the Marathon
