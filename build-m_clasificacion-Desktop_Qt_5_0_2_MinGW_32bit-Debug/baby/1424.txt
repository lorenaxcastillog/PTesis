 I am a first time mom with a 6 week old colicy baby who is usually up and fussy from around 10pm to 2am. My sister gave us an old Graco swing saying it would be an absolute lifesaver. My daughter ended up hating it. I hated it too because it didn't recline enough to support her neck, plus it wasn't very sturdy. So I took her to Babies R Us, where you can try the different swings out. Luckily she was very fussy at the time, even in my arms. She kinda liked the Nature's Touch swing but it was 40$ more and took 4 d batteries for 100 hours of continuous use. Then I saw almost all of them took 4 d batteries for 100 hours. Then I put her in the Baby Einstein swing and I am not kidding, she got quiet and happy. She loved the sound effects and the flashing lights on the tray. It also had a harness seat belt and reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around. I also noticed that It took only 3 d batteries for 200 hours of continuous use! There was another family shopping for baby swings at the time and when they saw how happy she got in the swing they decided to buy it too. That night she honestly slept from around 10pm to 2am. I actually got nervous because she was sleeping so long and woke her up! Oh, I also love how sturdy it is and that it easily folds down to store away or move around. It is the best swing Babies R Us has. Or at least my baby thinks so
