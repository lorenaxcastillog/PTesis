 My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top. He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention. I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated. At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort. Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested. Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not. Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
