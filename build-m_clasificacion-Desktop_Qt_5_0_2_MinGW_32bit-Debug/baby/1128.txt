 After having tried every bottle brand we could find, we ended up preferring the Dr. Brown's. They definitely reduced the amount of gas our baby was swallowing thus reducing the amount of spit up and burps. The measurements on the bottles are spot on, thus mixing formula in them is really easy. The bottles are very durable as are the nipples. They take a beating and still look brand new, including the measurement markings. I'm fairly certain the bottles we have will last until our baby is eating just solid food. And yeah, the parts are a pain to clean. But we can live with that. It's not a huge, huge deal. I will say that the Playtex disposables were just as good in terms of gas prevention, but we didn't feel good about throwing away all those plastic containers and the added cost of purchasing them. As well, the measurements on them were wildly inaccurate and thus totally useless
