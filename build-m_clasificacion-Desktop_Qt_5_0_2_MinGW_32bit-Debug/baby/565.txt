 This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do. I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is. A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile. The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands. One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side.
