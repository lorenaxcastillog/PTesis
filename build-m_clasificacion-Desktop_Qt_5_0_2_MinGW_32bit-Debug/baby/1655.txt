 I ordered this crib for my daughter who will arrive on or before March 30, 2007. We received this crib one week before the actual delivery date, so that was a nice surprise! My husband and I put the crib up with no problems at all! The wood is not the best quality, but what do you expect, you paid $180 for it! The finish is nice and makes it look like an expensive crib. There was only one scratch mark and it was on the back of the crib, so it really was not a big deal! Overall, we are extremely pleased with this crib and cannot wait for the arrival of our daughter
