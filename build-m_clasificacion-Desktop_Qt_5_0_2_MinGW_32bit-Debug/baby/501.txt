 My 3 1/2 year old son finally graduated into his "big boy bed" with our move into our first house. That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib. We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there. The weird thing about it, however, is that the pressure bars "POP!". You'll get the rail in place on the bed, push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green' to indicate they're locked... then after a while they'll go "POP!" and begin to inch their way UP into the 'red zone', meaning "unlocked". It's weird! It doesn't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed, but it's a loud noise that, until he was used to it, would wake him out of a dead sleep. All in all, I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds. It's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night
