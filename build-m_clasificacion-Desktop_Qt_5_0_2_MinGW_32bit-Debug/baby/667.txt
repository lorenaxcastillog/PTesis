 My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter, and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand-new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat. We were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law, one to my sister-in-law, and keep the third for my husband's car, but then we realized that more than likely, if we brought the baby over to their homes, chances are the baby would already be in his car seat. We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately! This way, we can bring our son to Grandma's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another. The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage, too. Plus, the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt. A must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby
