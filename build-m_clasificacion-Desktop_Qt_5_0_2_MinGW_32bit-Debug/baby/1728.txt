 I thought that because there were no buttons or batteries that my three year-old daughter would not enjoy it but I was wrong. She loves it!!! This doll goes every where that she does. I purchased this doll to help with potty training and it did the trick. This is a quality doll, that when you squeeze her tummy she can go potty. Feeding her the water is a little hard because you have to make sure you get the bottle in her mouth all the way. But she doesn't care if she spits the water up or if she actually goes potty. She also loves taking her into the bath tub too! Not as expensive as other dolls but well worth the money spent
