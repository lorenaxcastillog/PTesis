 We bought an earlier model of this seat when my son was 4, and we are still using it as he turns 8. We have one in each of our two cars, and we keep a third out on the west coast for when we are there traveling. Unlike the other review currently posted for this seat, we have really loved the cupholders - there is room for them to pop out in our car, so they are kept out all the time. They work for water bottles, crayons, little plastic toys, etc. It has held up well to abuse, adjusts to different sizes, looks sporty, and generally gets a thumbs up.
