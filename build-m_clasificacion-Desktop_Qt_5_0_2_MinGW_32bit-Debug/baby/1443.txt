 My son is 6 months old and was becoming way to heavy for me to carry in the Bjorn anymore. My low back and shoulders we really starting aching. So I decided to see if their was something else out there and I found it! I was torn between the Playtex hip hammock and the Ellaroo. The playtex carrier had so much good feedback that I thought I would love too. I decided to get them both and give them a try. I took the hip hammock back immediately. The material was scratchy and uncomfortable. It felt so synthetic and looked cheap and ugly on. I wanted something I could wear out and still look stylish. When the Ellaroo arrived I was so happy! The fabric is soft and beautiful, it has a really natural feel to it. Now the real test will my son love it too. He did! The second day he actually feel asleep in it. I am able to carry him around for a long time with out feeling crippled afterwards. It is great for shopping as well. It folds up small and goes on in an instant. My son wont deal with sitting in his infant carrier while I grocery shop so I would always end up pushing the cart, holding him with that seat in the way, and minding my 3 year old at the same time. I know you moms can relate. Now he is content riding on my hip and things are a lot smoother for everyone! I highly recommend it! Just checking back in- my son is one year old now and I am still using the carrier on a daily basis. We both are comfy and happy. Now that he is walking it is great to keep him up when I don't want him crusing and touching everything like at the doctors office. If I was just holding him he would just squirm away and get down. The carrier has also gone through several washings and is holding up just fine. My husband jokes that one day my son will be wearing me in it! haha
