 I love this bumper. It isn't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely, without bunching. And the price is much more reasonable than the $$ bumpers that go with bedding sets. Mostly I can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings. I know his arms and legs won't get tangled in the railings, but he also can breathe. Great product. It is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib.
