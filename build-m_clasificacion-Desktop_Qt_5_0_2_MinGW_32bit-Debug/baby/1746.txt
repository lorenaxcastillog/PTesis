 I purchased the Twilight Turtle as a Christmas gift for my 27 month old grandson and he says "I Like it!". He asks for it every single night at bedtime. His favorite color is the amber, which is almost impossible to see, but he likes to hold the turtle and aim the stars at his pj's and the wall behind his bed - so it works for him. While he does not use the toy as it was meant to be used (sitting on a dresser so that the ceiling/wall is illuminated) and prefers to hold onto the turtle and aim it like a flashlight, he really enjoys it, and that's the whole point!
