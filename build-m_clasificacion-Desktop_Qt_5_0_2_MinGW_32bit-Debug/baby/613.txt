 I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests. The gate is built well...simple and functional. It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily. It went up easy and works as designed. It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue. In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close. My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended. Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs
