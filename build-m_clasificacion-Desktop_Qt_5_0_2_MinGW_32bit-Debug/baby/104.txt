 We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first, however after about 2 months the 1st receiver, (it came with two), just suddenly stoped working! I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen, but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working! There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we're not the only family having problems. Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model
