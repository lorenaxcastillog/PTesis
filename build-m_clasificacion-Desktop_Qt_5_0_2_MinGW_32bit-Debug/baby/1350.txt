 I got this sling when my first son was 1.5 months old and I was trying to shop in Target. He was screaming in his car seat so I put it on right in the store!!! I liked it because I could nurse him in it while wearing a nursing top - much easier than in the Bjorn, and nobody can see what you are doing. The padded lip on the sling is actually really great, it helps prop the baby's head up, and also keeps them from slipping out, which almost happened with a sling my cousin lent me. I am now using it with my second son, and sometimes I can slip the sling off me when he is sleeping and tuck it around him and he stays asleep, although you have to make sure you place it in such a way that the ring doesn't get in the way or the baby doesn't get tangled in the "tail." I don't do this all the time, but it is a nice way to get him to sleep when he's really having a hard time, and because the sling smells like mommy, he feels comfy. I've taken the sling everywhere, and my older son still likes to be in it, even though he's a tad over the weight limit. I didn't give it 5 stars because as really tiny infants my sons did not like this. Now though, we use it a lot around the house when we don't want to fiddle with the Bjorn - a great way to deal with separation anxiety. If you are really clever, there is a way to wear it so you can have an older child on your back. My older son likes that a lot!
