 I have a contemporary home. The front stairs to the second floor are slotted w/spaces in between plus metal tubular hand rails with spaces and a landing with the same hand rail. We moved in when my children were much older. Suddenly, I have a two year old grandchild and one on the way. I panicked. What to do about safety. Glass or pexiglass would have taken too long to install and very costly. Suddenly I saw the ad for the railnet. While it is probably easier to put it on a straight opening, we were successful in figuring out how to string the netting on an angle. I feel so much better knowing that children will not be able to fall through the railing. We plan on putting one under the stair slats as well. I highly recommend this product. It is inexpensive, simple and strong.
