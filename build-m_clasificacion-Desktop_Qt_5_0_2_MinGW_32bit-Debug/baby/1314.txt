 I bought the Bundle Me for my new granddaughter born in November, and my daughter and her family live in the Minneapolis area. It is easy for them to put the baby in the carrier, zip up the Bundle Me and there is no way the baby gets any cold air on her. The Bundle Me zips up on both sides and the top covers the baby's head or folds down for her to see. It is hard to put a coat, mittens, hat, etc. on a newborn or young infant, and it is just not necessary with this really cool product. Unlatch the car seat and carry it in and the baby stays warm. I bought the heavier version due to the climate and time of year but I bet the lighter version is equally great
