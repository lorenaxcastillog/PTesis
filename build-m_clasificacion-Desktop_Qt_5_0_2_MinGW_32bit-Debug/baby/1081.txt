 It took one 2-year old supervisor and 3 adults to get this bed put together. This bed does not come with a support for the mattress. However, you can buy a piece of board that has material covering it at Toys R Us for $38. It's worth the money. Our son loves the bed. It's very sturdy. The headboard where you can store "books" is a little bit shaky but nobody is going to be sitting up there. He also loves the area where you can roll cars down. Mom likes it too. One area, the headboard, was horrible to put together because the plastic was not molded as well as it could have been. The headboard had four areas where you needed to push thru and then push it down to stay intake. We ended up using oil from the kitchen to get this accomplished like another reviewer had done
