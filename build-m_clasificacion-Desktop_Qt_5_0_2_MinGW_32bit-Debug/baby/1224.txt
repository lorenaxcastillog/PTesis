 I love this rocker. It may not rock but keeps my son entertained for longer periods of time than any other item we have in the house. We leave him unbuckled and he scoots down onto his back and plays with his toys. He didn't like the toy bar so I purchased and attached a Tiny Love Toy Bar. He loves the octopus although he can pull it off and into himself. My 5 month old is near 20 lbs so I am very relieved that this rocker goes up to 40 lbs
