 My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds! I love the rain! even I fall asleep listening to it. I had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter. So I block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker :) I am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby!!!!!!!
