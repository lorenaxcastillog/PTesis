 I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work. I used it FREQUENTLY (at least twice daily) for the 5 months I pumped at work. It always worked wonderfully. I never had trouble with let-down or supply. Sometimes I filled both 8 oz. bottles in a 15-minute session! Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply, I can't imagine this pump not working great. I didn't have any problems with it the whole time I used it
