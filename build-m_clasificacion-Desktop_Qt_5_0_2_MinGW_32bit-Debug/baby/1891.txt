 I actually received this valance in the Zanzibar bed set. But, if you need to purchase another one for an extra window in the nursery - do not hesitate. This is a beautiful valance and actually has the same lovely fabrics (including suede like fabric) & textured animals as the bed skirt, bumper, & quilt. I have noticed other bed sets (even the expensive ones) where the valances are quite plain. The valance measure's around 90 inches wide. But, is meant to have a bunched up look so it looks great on narrower windows. Also, beige or sage colored drapes or sheers would be a great complement to this valance to shield the nursery from day light during nap time
