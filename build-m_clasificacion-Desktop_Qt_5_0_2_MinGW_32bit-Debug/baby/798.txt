 My husband is a NYC doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son's room in this theme. Since my hubby deals with taxi's and limo's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it. We also love Manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in L.I. The set is very well made and I like the fact that since it feels like it will last, my son can grown with it. It is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years
