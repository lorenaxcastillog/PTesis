 My husband and I looked at several cribs in-store and were a little unsure of buying one over the internet, however everything worked out and we are very pleased w/ our purchase. The price, no shipping and handling etc. can't be beat. The crib went together relatively well and is quite sturdy. The wood does mark rather easily, but with our budget a hardwood crib was out of the question. We also purchased the DaVinci Emily Changer/Dresser. They look great together. Overall, we are very happy w/ our decision
