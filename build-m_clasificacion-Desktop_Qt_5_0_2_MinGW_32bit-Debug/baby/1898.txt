 My husband and I are very happy with this armoire! We have a small apartment with little storage space and this armoir is the perfect size providing loads of extra storage. I read other reviews so I knew it didn't have a hanging bar, but I knew I wasn't going to be hanging clothes. One thing I didn't expect was that it was white inside, but it makes it easier to see. We had it put together within an hour, instructions were easy to follow. A solid piece of furniture well worth $240. Jessica,NY
