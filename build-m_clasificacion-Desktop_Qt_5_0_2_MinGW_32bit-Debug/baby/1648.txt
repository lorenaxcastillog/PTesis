 The blue cat cushystraps are SO soft! They are very easy to install, and have the added bonus of helping to keep the straps straight in her carseat... this way, when I go to put her in the seat, the straps are not and don't become twisted in the process. That used to be a bit of a problem with our Graco seat before we used the cushystraps. My 3 month old daughter loves to rub her face and mouth on the straps. I imagine theywould have helped hold her head too, when she was a newborn
