 My son was learning to potty on the toilet but I was in no rush due to all the extra time I had to spend cleaning the potty "splash zone" around our toilet. I was happy to purchase the Peter Potty and give it a shot and happier that Amazon had free shipping on it at the time. It arrived quickly and was easy to set up. My son loves it!!! He is proud at his new talent and I am happy to spend less time wearing cleaning gloves. I add a tiny amount of bleach to the water in the top compartment so when he flushes there is a little less cleaning for me. Thanks Amazon
