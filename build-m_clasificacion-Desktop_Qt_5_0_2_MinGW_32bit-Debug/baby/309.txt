 Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided. Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down. If the smell isn't a problem for you, go for it. But if you're picky with the smell, research something else
