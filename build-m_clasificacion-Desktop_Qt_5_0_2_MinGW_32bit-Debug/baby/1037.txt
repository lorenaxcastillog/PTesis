 Love the Sunshade. For the most part works well, except if you are running in rather windy conditions, then, it just flies back and does not cover the kids so well. I really use my double jog stroller for jogging and am happy to have the sunshade, the kids like it too. The only other frustration is if you have a small child who is rather reclined in the stroller and the sun is close to setting, you may not get good coverage to keep the sun out of eyes unless you pull the shade completely over the stroller . . . then the older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out!
