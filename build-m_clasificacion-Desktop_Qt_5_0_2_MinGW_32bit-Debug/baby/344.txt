 I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though
