 We bought this car seat (and the snap 'n go) based on good reviews (not the ones listed here). It did not meet our expectations. I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it. Otherwise, I have a hard time finding positive things to say. It is way too heavy. Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days, it was heavy to carry around. Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months, it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time. The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work. On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop. When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend. I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn't need the support in the grocery cart---that is really the only reason I still use it
