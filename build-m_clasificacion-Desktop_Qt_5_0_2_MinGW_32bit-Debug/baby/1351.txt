 I bought the NoJo sling before my daughter was born in feb 2002 and was looking forward to using it for breastfeeding and getting around without the hassel of a stroller or carseat.It was the best friend that I needed being a new mother. Life was so much easier with it and still is.My daughter is two and I use this sling still and she's grown so much more since then.Thanks NoJo for making life for me and my husband so easy and fun.The malls and grocery stores will never be the same.Plus the mopping of our home is made easier because she just holds on and watches safe and out of the way from her sling, which is also like her blankie.Thank you, Jennifer and Celeste from Miami,Florida
