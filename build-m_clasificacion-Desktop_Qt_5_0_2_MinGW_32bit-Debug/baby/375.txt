 I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface. THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around. Also a few of my knobs pull off easily. My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come, both knob and cover. Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover. They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. It probably depends on your stove
