 Bought 2 different monitors; this one has great features such as the motion sensor, auto and scan settings. The night vision is weak but daytime looks great. Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback. I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom. None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear. It is the best one that I've found on the market
