 I have tried 2 different plastic bathtubs. The first one was sturdy and spacious but it has a bump that was very uncomfortable around my baby's waistline. The other one has a fabric sling on top of the plastic bathtub. It provided good support but my baby felt wobbly. Both bathtubs prove to be unsatisfactory. I use this bath form in my shower cubicle (on the floor) with a long flexible shower head. My baby does not fuss in it as she feels secured. It dries very quickly. Great product with a reasonable price.
