 I absolutely love these bottles. I have used them with all 3 of my children with great success and my oldest is almost 15. Gas was never a problem and my babies hardly ever spit up. Everyone always commented on how nice my babies always smelled because they never had that sour smell that babies that spit up so much do. I worked in numerous daycare centers and any time a parent had problems with a gassy baby that spit up all the time I always recommend Platex Nursers to them. 9 x's out of 10 their problems were drastically reduced thanks to Playtex. I am now pregnant with my 4th baby and though I plan to breastfeed as much as I can if I need a back up bottle or nursing doesn't work for some reason then Playtex will be my bottle of choice. Of all the new bottles out there on the market Playtex will still be my number 1 bottle of choice. If there would be any drawback at all it would be the cost of the liners. But I often got lucky and would find some at yardsales or on sale and would stock up. Also some store brands carry liners just as good. I had a few plastic bottles around just in case of running out but my babies didn't like them nearly as much and I could always tell a difference in their happiness because they would get gassy again. Buy the Playtex Nursers. They are well worth the money
