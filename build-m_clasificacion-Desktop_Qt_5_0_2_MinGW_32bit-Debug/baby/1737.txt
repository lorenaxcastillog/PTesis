 Although expensive, the JJ Cole Bundle Me is a great investment. I receive a lot of compliments on the one I use for our daughter. No more worrying about scraping baby blankets along dirty cars as you maneuver in the garage with the car seat. Our daughter appreciates having less bulk in her seat as well! The Bundle Me is the best quality of car seat covers you'll find. Buying the cheap brands only costs more in the end when you buy the authentic Bundle Me. My only warning: NEVER buy from Target- their return policy is meant to trick the consumer. Even with receipt and tags, their merchandise will not be accepted after 90 days. Buy your Bundle Me from Amazon or the JJ Cole website. Trust me, I've registered for my wedding and baby with Target. We've lost over $500.00 due to their ridiculous return policy.
