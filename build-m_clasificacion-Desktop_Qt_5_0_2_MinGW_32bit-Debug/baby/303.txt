 My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year. I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day. I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it. SO I would go in my car and do it. All I had a first was the battery pack. I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction. Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again. We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA. My husband would drive and I would pump. It is great..
