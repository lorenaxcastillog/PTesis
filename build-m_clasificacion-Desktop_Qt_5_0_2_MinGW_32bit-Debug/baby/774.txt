 I was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this iCrib sound system. It has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer, so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the iCrib will shut down after the specified time. The nightlight is also really neat, as it cycles between four different colors. The only problem with this product is that it cannot run on AC, only on batteries, so we'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years, but otherwise this is a great product. Edit--After further consideration I would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons. First, I have found the lack of an AC power source to be very inconvenient. Second, as the batteries wear down, the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly
