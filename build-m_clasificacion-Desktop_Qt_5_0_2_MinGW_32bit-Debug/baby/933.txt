 I have to say this is a better made one than some of the others. My mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her. How the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached. I had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru. The arm rest raise up. Not sure about the drink holder part...doesn't seem very durable but we will see. Other than the cover part I feel this will be a good item
