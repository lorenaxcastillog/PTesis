 For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house. On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess
