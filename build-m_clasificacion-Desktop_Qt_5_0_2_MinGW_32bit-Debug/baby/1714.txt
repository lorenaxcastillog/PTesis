 I usually write very long reviews but I think I can cut this one short! Other step stools skid around, are too brightly colored and too short! My 3 y.o b/g twins have used this since they were 18 months old. They use it for getting to the sink, to get on the potty, to reach something up high, to get on the chairs to eat, an deven to get into bed sometimes! They LOVE them. The stools are very sturdy and I recomend them for ANYONE, whether you have kids or not, it holds almost any weight and is very convinient and the perfect height. We have one in each bathroom, one in the upstairs hall closet and one in the cabinet under the kitchen sink,(or under the table lol). That means we have 4 of these stools. They are very simple to use and I even use them to sit on when I wash my younger babies. I plan to have these around for YEARS. They are great, clean and blend perfectly into any room. Buy them, they dont skid and are great for ANY age
