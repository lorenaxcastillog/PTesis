 I've been using these to store milk for 6 months now, and I LOVE them. (I use the 8 oz size) They stack together so they don't take up too much room in my bag in the morning. (I work 12 hour shifts 3 days a week-so need to take several every day) And they sit upright so they don't leak in my cooler or in the refrigerator at work (and avoids the gross-out factor with co-workers that the bags can have) I recently bought the adaptors to pump directly into them, and love them even more. Also, my husband has to handle the milk when I am at work, and these are way easier for him than the bags, so he wastes less milk to spilling, etc. My only comment is that you do have to be careful not to overfill them, as breast milk expands when it freezes, and can pop off the lid or crack the container. But this would be a concern with ANY storage container, bags included. Hate the way breast milk storage bags leak when they are thawing out, and no matter how flat you try to freeze them, they never stack up well, so you end up with an avalanche of bags falling out of the freezer. I love that these containers are sturdy plastic that can stack up in the freezer, and they don't require special handling to thaw to avoid contaiminating the milk. As to buying the bases and lids separately, the containers are not meant to be used more than three times before they are discarded, while the lids hold up much longer, so I'm glad I can only buy what I need at a time, so no wasted money or extra supplies to store. As to cost, other similar containers cost $3-4 each, so $15 for 10 lids and bases seems very reasonable
