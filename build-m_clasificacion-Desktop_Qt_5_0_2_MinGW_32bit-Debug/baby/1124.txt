 These are great, we actually have them in a couple different sizes so my son can grow into them. (NOTE: We got him the blue one, but they make you review them separately) Here's what I love: 1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm. 2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him. 3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack. Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy. I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready.
