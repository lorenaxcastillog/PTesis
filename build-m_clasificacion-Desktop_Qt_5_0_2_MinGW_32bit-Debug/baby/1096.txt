 This is a great product and I'm glad I went ahead and bought it. I go jogging with my daughter nearly every day, so I needed something that would block the sun well. I had been using a light blanket and clothespins, but wouldn't you know, just as I got going at a good jogging pace, my daughter would remove a clothespin and the "shade" was no more. I was stopping to fix it more than I was actually jogging. With this sunshade, she can't undo it...although she tries! I can pull it all the way down (as low as I can on my particular jogger) and she can still see out but is shielded from the sun. I like the side pockets - great for keys and small items - and the velcro tabs are easy to use. The only drawback - and this is such a minor issue, probably hardly worth mentioning - is that the shade doesn't fold up all nice and compact like the instructions say. I wrestled with my shade for awhile before I finally got it folded up (it was a matter of "doggone it, this thing isn't going to get the best of me!")...and even then, it wasn't very stable. My suggestion - keep the little bag it comes in and semi-fold it and store it in that. All in all, this is worth it. Wish I'd had one when I started jogging with my daughter last year
