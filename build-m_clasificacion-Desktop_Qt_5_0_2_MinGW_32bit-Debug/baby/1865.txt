 Good: 1 Light weight 2 Mesh/breathable fabric for warm weather 3 Handles are tall enough for woman in heels, or husbands. 4 Nice colors 5 Easier to steer than other stollers. (can use 1 hand) 6 Folds flat and has carry handle Bad: 1 Too light to put your bag or purse on the handles, will tip with no baby in it. 2 Doesn't recline 3 Sometimes the 5 point harness takes more effort to unclip Overall, this is a good investment. Turns out most parents will end up using thier compact 'umbrella' stoller way more than the deluxe, super gadget stoller. It's so much easier to use these simple light weight strollers, than their bulky, wide, heavy counterparts.
