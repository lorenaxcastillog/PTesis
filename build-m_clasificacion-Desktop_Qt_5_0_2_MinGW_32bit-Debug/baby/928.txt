 We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately. She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it. The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me. This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now. It is easy to open, shut and lock. I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though. I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright. The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.
