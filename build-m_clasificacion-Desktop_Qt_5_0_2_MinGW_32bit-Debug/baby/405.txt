 This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts.
