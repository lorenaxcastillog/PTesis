 This baby gate is great!!! the top of my stairs both walls going in 2 different angles and i am so glad that i found this gate! it works great and i havn't had any problams with it at all. I installed it as soon as i got it. and i didnt seem to have any problams installing it. I have a 2 yr old and all moms and dads out there know how 2 yr olds can be at trying out new things! it is a tall gate so he cant lean over it and fall. all the bars on it are vertical so he cant climb it. and the lock on it is easy to use but he cant unlock it. The gate is made out of metal and is welded together so you dont have to worry about the bars coming out like you do with the wooden gates. I highly recomend this gate for any room any doorway and its great at the top of the stairs
