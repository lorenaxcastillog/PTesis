 The Bundle Me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months. It attaches very easily to the carseat, and I can leave all the extra blankets at home (except for a light one). This particular model is wind and rain resistant, which is nice for keeping my little one dry. It's a great concept; kudos to whomever invented it! I do have 2 complaints though. First, it's not as effective for younger babies. My daughter is just 7 weeks old, and I don't zip up all the way. This keeps the fabric out of her face. I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her. Secondly, the zippers aren't as smooth as I'd like them to be. They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside, so zipping up is sometimes more work, and always when I'm in a hurry! But overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's nice having a barrier against the wind, rain and cold with just one item
