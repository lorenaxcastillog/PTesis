 We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!
