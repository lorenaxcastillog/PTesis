 Strange title, I know, but keep reading and you'll understand it perfectly. First of all, the liners last a long time and are easy to use and refill. I really like how there is a very handy and very child safe cutting blade for the liners mounted onto the inside of the lower changing door. I noticed some reviewers stating that they had problems with the item controling odor, while most other's have had no trouble at all. Taking this into account, I purchased my Diaper Dekor with an open mind. I had no trouble for the first 5 months. Then I also noticed an odor in my son's room, even when the unit was empty, and after I had wiped down the outter lid, inner lid, and flaps, inside and out. Then it occured to me: There was condensation on the inside of the liner bag when I emptied it and then used the blade to cut it. I wondered if maybe the bacteria or something from the moisture was now on the blade and then causing the smell. So, I pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto the blade to see what would happen. The smell went away. I then thought, "That's just too easy, and a bit crazy. It can't be that simple". So, I waited until I noticed the smell again a couple of months later. I used the hand sanitizer again, and lo and behold, the smell once again went away. The gist of it is, if you're going to put a wast material into something where it's going to sit for a few days before you get rid of it, it is going to start to decompose. The Diaper Dekor is great at controlling those icky germs and bacteria and keeping them in one safe place. The problem is, decomposisition creats heat, and the more decomposing solid matter, and the longer is sits, the warmer it all becomes. So, if the temperature inside your waste recepticle is warmer (which it will be) than the surrounding room temperature, condensation will form. So when you cut the liner to empy the unit, clean the blade. No odor. No problems
