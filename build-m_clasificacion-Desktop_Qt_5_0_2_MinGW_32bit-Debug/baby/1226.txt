 My husband and I purchased Avent bottles for our newborn after doing our research for the best bottles in helping minimize gas, colic etc... Yikes! Needless to say, we were HIGHLY disappointed with Avent. By the recommendation of our pediatrician, we went out and bought a new set of Dr. Brown's bottles---kine of pricey, but WORTH every penny!! With Avent, my son was getting super gassy and colicky. He would cry so hard with gas pains that he'd clinch his little fists, crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse. Burping, mylicon and gripe water didn't even help. Our days and nights were sleepless--he wouldn't nap because he was crying--and our nights would average about 3-4 hours of sleep. Now, with Dr. Brown's---our son is a NEW little man. He STILL gets gas, but not like he did with the Avent bottles. All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he's out into LA LA land---he's now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6-8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks---and he's only 1 month old. :) For some reason, when he was feeding from the Avent, he would suck uncontrollably, I'd see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in. With Dr. Brown's, he has WAY more controlled sucking, it's much more rhythmic and no air bubbles in the nipple! MANY thumbs up for Dr. Brown's!
