 We bought this product back in 2005 and used it during an international trip through several airports. It worked as advertised in all the jumbo jets, and elicited generally positive reactions from other passengers and flight crew; however it could not pass through the aisles of an Embraer commuter plane that we had to take on a short leg of our journey. In order to secure it correctly on the airline seat, you may have to get a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant. Having this car seat/stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids; they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates. I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps... for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall. As a car seat it was OK, it just takes some getting used to. We never used it in a rear-facing configuration, so I cannot rebut comments made by other users as regards their problems in that mode.
