 Reasons why I do not like this potty: 1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty! 2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways. 3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty. 4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess. I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield
