 This thing is awesome! We have a 7 month old and she just loves this stroller... and so does mom! The stoller is so lightweight and easy to maneuver that you can take it almost anywhere. We live in a small city and the stroller handles uneven pavement and curbs beautifully. I have also taken the stroller off-road trail running and as long as I lock the front pivot wheel, the stoller can easily manage rocks, branches, etc. Having this stoller has given me so much flexibility and opportunity to get out of the house with my daughter... especially recreationally. Things you will love about the stoller: - VERY easy to push, turn and maneuver - Lightweight - Quick release wheels (all of them) - Great shocks - Adjustable (large) sun visor - Folds up compactly - Easy to use brake & front wheel pivot release - Cool colors (we have lime green) - Reflective The only thing I could recommend as an enhanced feature would be a shoulder strap for easier carrying. This product is a great buy and defintely worth the money!!!!
