 What a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter. When my son wants me to play a game, puzzle or play on the floor. I just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time. I have also found it helpful when I fold laundry. I can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what I am doing. It props the baby's head up just enough--better than just laying flat on the floor. The lounger also cradles the baby. I wish that I had found this when my son was a baby. I recomend this lounger to every new mommy.
