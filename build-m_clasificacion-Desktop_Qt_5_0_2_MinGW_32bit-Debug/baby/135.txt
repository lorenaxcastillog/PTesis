 I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car. I thought the lights and music would distract him. After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry. It is far less irritating. The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work. What genius engineered that? Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes. Don't waste your money!!
