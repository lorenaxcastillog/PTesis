 I should have checked this out before registering for it. The lid won't stay shut, the bottom wipes brown, the unit leaks. I contacted the manufacturer. When telling him about the lid not staying shut, he asked, "are you sure there isn't a ghost in the house"...they offered to replace it if I returned it to them, offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products. After reading these reviews I think I'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product
