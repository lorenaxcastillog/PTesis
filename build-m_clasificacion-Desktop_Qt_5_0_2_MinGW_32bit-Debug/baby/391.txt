 Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there. This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless. It is just very poorly made from cheap materials. I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target. Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design. Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money
