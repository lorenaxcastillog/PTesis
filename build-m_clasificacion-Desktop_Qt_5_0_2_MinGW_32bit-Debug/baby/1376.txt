 My 7 month old has used this daily since he was 8 weeks. He loves it even more now. As he grows he finds new ways to play with the gym. He loves the music and lights especially. He will play on his own for 20 minutes at least. This is a lifesaver for me, I can use it to occupy him while I get ready in the morning, or any time I need to distract him, or just put him on the floor to play and know he'll stay in one place. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I think it's the one piece of baby gear I absolutely would not give up
