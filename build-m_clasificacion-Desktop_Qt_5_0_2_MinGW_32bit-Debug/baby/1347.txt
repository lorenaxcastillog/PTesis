 I finally got smart with the 3rd child and bought these gates (3 of them) instead of those kind that you push down to lock into place and they fall over, these gates are so secure and really tall, my cats have a hard time jumping over them. My friend has this gate also and has an 80 pound dog and he hasn't been able to budge it. We have a really big doorway from our hall to living room and we were able to use 2 of the bigger 10" extenders and it fit perfectly. Each gate comes with a 5" and a 10" extender. I would highly recommend these gates
