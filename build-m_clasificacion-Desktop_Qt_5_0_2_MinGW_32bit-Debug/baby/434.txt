 I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles
