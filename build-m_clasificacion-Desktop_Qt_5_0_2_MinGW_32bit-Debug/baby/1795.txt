 I love it! Great way to keep my daughter from touching/chewing the cart and me from having to touch the cart handle. There are loops to attach toys and 2 side pockets to hold small items. I find the material thickness to be perfectly fine, I mean come on this isnt a carseat it's fabric meant to be a barrier between baby & cart. If it were padded or had an organizer in the back it would be too bulky & take up cart space. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the safety belt is too long & it isnt attached to the product which means it will most likely get lost (Mine did) Overall great product & makes an excellent babyshower gift.
