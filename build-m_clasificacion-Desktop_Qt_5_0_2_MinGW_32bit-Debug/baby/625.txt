 I have no idea how our parents had us with out these! They are the best invention! My son likes to play with plates, so I can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating. I have a toddler and a 9 mo old. NEITHER of them have been able to remove these things. And beleive me, they've tried. So I dont know what that other review was talking about. They're inexpensive, easy to use, and clean.
