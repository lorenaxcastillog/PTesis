 Being a first time parent I wasn't sure exactly how to go about co-sleeping... Although I knew I wanted some type of device to keep my baby a bit secure. I could have never imagined I'd be so pleased, or have so many uses for this cozy little bed! The obvious use is in bed with parents. It is a perfect fit our full size bed (admittedly we're not the kind of people who feel the need for lots of room to spread out). The sides of the bed are just high enough and sturdy enough to give you feel of being next to baby, without the feel of rolling on top of baby. The light on the bed is perfect for a quick peek. I also put my daughter in this nest during nap time. The sleep positioners keep her feeling snuggled and cozy. It's also convenient if you're the type of parent who likes to have baby near at all times. This little bed can be carried from one room to another without waking baby. I found it wonderful for transitioning to the crib. I simply placed the nest in the crib and she felt right at home! Finially, this is the perfect little bed to bring along for travel! I would strongly suggest this item to anyone interested in co-sleeping
