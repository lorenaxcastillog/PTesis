 This is a great product and purchasing it at Amazon was a great deal. Not only was it the lowest price that I found, but I got free shipping and I had it in my hand within 3 days. It came in about a million pieces so it does take a little time to set up, but the instructions were clear and I found it to be relatively easy to put together. The vinyl seat and removable tray make clean up a snap too. The real critic was my daughter who is VERY particular about her toys, and she loves it. She likes to turn herself around to look at the design on the seat cover, and she is thoroughly entertained by the jungle toy. My one word of caution....beware "tomatoe sauce" on the vinyl, it can stain it. :
