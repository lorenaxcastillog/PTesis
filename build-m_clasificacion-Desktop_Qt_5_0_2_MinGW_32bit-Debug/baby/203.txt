 I just took a course from the Florida Highway Safety program. I thought something like this would be wonderful, especially for little ones in the rear facing position. I was dead wrong. Anything put in front of, on the side of, in fact, anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash. This toy, even latched down, poses a threat to the baby. He or she may just have to be bored for a while. On long trips have Mom or Dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment
