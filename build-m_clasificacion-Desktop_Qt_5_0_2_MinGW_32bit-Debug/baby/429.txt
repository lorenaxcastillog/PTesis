 I inherited this product from my neightbor last week. I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it. I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part. Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart. I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used. What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily
