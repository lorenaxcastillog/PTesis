 I was given these wall hangings as a present. I love them and they make the room look great. We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them. There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back, but that seemed too complicated to deal with. Therefore, my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top. My husband then used a finish nail in the wall, and used the safty pin to hang over the nail. The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on. It was easy to do, and the wall hangings look great! I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight, but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed. I hope this helps others with this problem. I still wonder though, why on earth the company didn't foresee this problem in the first place
