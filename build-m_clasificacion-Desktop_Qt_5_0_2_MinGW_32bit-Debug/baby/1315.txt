 This step still is great for my 2 year old. It's very durable, made of pine, I think, and goes with everything in the bathroom. I do like the fact that I can paint it any color I wanted later, since it's just made out of wood. I bought it b/c it was the only step stool I found where the second step folded inside the bigger step, for when she gets older. The second step is so easy to pull in and out, that my toddler can do it now too. I gave it four stars becasue it would have been nice if it could have converted into a chair too.
