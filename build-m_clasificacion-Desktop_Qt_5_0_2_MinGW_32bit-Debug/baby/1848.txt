 After reading over reviews of nearly every wipe warmer out there, including Prince Lionheart brand, we decided to go ahead and buy this one and we are SO HAPPY WITH IT! Since you leave the wipes in their plastic they do not dry out at all! The wipes are so nice and warm and our son LOVES THEM! He can actually sleep through diaper changes and he is only 2 weeks old! This model warms from the top so it doesn't dry out the wipes and there is actually liquid still left in the plastic by the time we run out and change to a new pack of wipes! We go through an 80 pack refill per week with no problems whatsoever and you DO NOT add any water or anything to this warmer - just plug it in and leave it plugged in and pop in some wipes. ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE is that there is a mechanism in this warmer that keeps the wipes pushed to the top so you never have to reach down in there to get wipes - a hard to find feature with warmers! They do not brown and they are perfectly warm for about 10 seconds out of the warmer - plenty of time to wipe their bottoms off! We HIGHLY recommend this warmer - it is THE BEST in our opinion as new parents
