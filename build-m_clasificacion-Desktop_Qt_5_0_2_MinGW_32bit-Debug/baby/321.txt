 In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless. 1) The "spa" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby 2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this. 3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus. All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same
