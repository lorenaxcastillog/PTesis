 I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW
