 We have had this seat in my husband's car, and so I have not used this as much as our infant seat. Now that my son is outgrowing the infant seat, I will be using it more often. I bought it for the great ratings, and the only thing I don't really get is why there is prickly velcro on the side of the straps where the baby's arms rest. I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong. It seems like the velcro is to hold the straps out of the way for putting the child in the seat, but when buckled, they are sitting on top of his legs. I am also looking for a car seat stroller to fit this, and have no idea where to look! I'll post again, after I use this seat more, but so far, so good
