 I gave this exersaucer 5 stars because it keeps my baby interested so that I can do housework. We took our 3 month old daughter to the store and tried out each one to see her reaction. At 5 months now, she is able to pull on everything on her own without any assistance from me. We think it is great for building strength in her legs. My froggie doesn't croak like the other user mentioned, but everything else is the same. I am very pleased with our purchase, which is good considering it was the most expensive one
