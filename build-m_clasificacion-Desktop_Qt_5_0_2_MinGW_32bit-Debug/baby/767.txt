 The car seat itself is awesome, but the condition it arrived in was awful. The box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind. There was nothing covering the seat (like a plastic bag) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat. It was a gift for my Grandson for Christmas so I didn't have time to return it and hope for a timely return. It took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat. Simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me.
