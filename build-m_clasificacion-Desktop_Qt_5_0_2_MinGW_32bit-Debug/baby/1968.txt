 My husband and I purchased this gate to reduce damage to our walls and have a sturdy top of stairs gate, as we have a steep staircase with several stairs. The gate is very sturdy, and overall is easy to install. The only tricky thing about the installation is knowing how to properly lift and open the gate after tightening the screws. The gate does close on its own without having to lift the gate and handle as the instructions mention, but after looking at the packaging at how the gate is supposed to look after it is installed, and how to lift the door, we had to tighten the screws further into the cups on the wall to achieve the proper closure. Would recommend this gate to those with small children, as it is very sturdy, but if there are elderly persons in the household, they may need assistance in opening the gate
