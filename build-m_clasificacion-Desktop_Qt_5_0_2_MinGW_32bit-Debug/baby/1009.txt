 I got the Safe Bather over a year ago with my first son and am due with my second son and will be getting another for him. I used it in the sink when my son was an infant and then moved it into the tub as he grew. He NEVER cried when I bathed him and seemed very comfortable. It holds in the warm water too. As he got older he sat on it and I would just lay him down to wash his lower half. I never had any problems with it or any smell issues. It machined washed and tumbled dried easily. After each use I would ring out as much water as I could and just hang it up on the curtain rod and let it drip dry. I would recommend it to anyone!
