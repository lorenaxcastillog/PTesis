 We bought two of these to take on a family trip. We chose these both for the price, and for the higher weight tolerance (45 lb). Our 40 pound six-year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo. They recline far enough for an infant, also. But, our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights. The strollers are compact and light. The underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag. There is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle, as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles. The stroller was also easy to maneuver. We are very pleased with our purchase! The stoller can even hold a Combi carseat, but it didn't work with our Graco
