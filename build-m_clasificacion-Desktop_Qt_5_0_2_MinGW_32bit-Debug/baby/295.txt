 Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child. This gate is all look and no function. It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it. If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work. I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together. I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6" then drilling two holes about 4" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something. Good luck!!
