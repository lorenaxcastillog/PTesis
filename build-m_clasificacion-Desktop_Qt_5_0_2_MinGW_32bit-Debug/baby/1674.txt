 We swaddled our daughter until she was 6 months old. This blanket does not work on very small babies, but we started using it around 2 months. It is wonderful. The only problem we had with it was when our daughter was strong enough, she could break out of it. At that point we switched to the Miracle Blanket (which really works like a straight jacket.. there is no escaping). Our daughter is now seven months old and sleeps unswaddled. She has slept through the night (12 hours) since two months of age, and I really believe that she is such a good sleeper because of the swaddling
