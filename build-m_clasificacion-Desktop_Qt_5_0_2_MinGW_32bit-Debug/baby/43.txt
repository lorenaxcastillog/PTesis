 I like the idea of all this in one case (and it's hard to complain at this price), but some of these things would be better bought separately. We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time. #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice. #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little! #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work. #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby. #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.) #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less. #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.) Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it. If you get it for a shower gift, great; if not, you can find substitute items just as easily
