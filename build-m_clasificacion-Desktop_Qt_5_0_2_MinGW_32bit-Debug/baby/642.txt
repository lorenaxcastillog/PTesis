 This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy.
