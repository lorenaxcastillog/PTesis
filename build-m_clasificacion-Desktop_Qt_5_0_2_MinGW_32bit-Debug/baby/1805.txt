 This is a great shopping cart cover! The cost is a little more than other covers but is definately worth the extra money. It covers every part of the cart your baby can touch. I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs (not a perfect fit - but covers everything). There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever (I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes). It is a bit large when folded (to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it), but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric. It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle (I'm guessing it's about 12"x8" and about 2"thick - I leave mine in the car). I just wish I would have found this sooner - my daughter loves it too. Would be a great gift for a baby shower
