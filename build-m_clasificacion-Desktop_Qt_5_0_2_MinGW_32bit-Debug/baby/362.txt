 I was so excited to buy this stroller. It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us!
