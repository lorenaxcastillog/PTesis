 We have had two of these rails for about three years now and are very happy with them. They have stood up to plenty of kicks and shoves from an active sleeper. The rails can be contracted when we need to transport them. On our twin mattress the rails take up about 2.5 inches off each side. I must admit that I did not know how to use the rails properly at first and thought they were challenging to remove. My husband, who read the directions, installed them easily and gave me a quick demo on how to adjust them. Once I was patient enough to learn how to use them, it was quick and easy to manuever them. These rails are secure and durable, ones that will last through younger siblings as well.
