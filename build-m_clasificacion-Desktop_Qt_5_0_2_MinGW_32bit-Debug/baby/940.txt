 I bought this for my son when he was just shy of 4 months old. Initially, he would just sit in the seat, occassionally moving sideways (probably because he lost his balance). After 5-10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button (he'd had enough). That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he'd grow to enjoy it. On the 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like a crazed kangaroo! His face had a wide smile and some drool, he was excited! From that point forward (and still going) he's consistently loved his time in the J-roo. He regularly has jumping sessions of 30-45 minutes while watching Clifford, Dragon Tales, ... This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs. Also, it's not a bad break for us parents now and again
