 We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously
