 I was given a Swaddle Me for my third child. She has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks. My oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not. I owe it all to the Swaddle Me. But at three months she outgrew the small size. I thought she was old enough to go without swaddling, boy was I wrong. It took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size. I have had my large Swaddle Me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then. Thank you Swaddle Me for helping me keep my sanity
