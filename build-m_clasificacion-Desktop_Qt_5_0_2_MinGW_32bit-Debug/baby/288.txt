 I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is. I also appreciate how many colors it comes in. What I am disappointed with is the durability. I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year. They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad. It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much. I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have. While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.
