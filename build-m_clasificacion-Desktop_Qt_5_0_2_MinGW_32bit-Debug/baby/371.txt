 I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper. It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap. I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover. This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye. Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60.
