 I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It's perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do. Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room. Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average. They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper.
