 We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets. My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping. I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast. Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels. I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat. He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor. He was bleeding. THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!! This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him. We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
