 We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks. We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit. I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off. An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony. We regret not reading the reviews before buying it. If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for
