 I got these and the imse vimse covers for my daughter. At first I thought I'd like the IV more, because it seemed as though the fit better around the leg, but I changed my mind quickly. Not only do these fit just fine, but they are MUCH MORE DURABLE! After a few washings, the IV began to loose shape and the velcro began to warp (and I cold water wash and line dry). The BUmmis look just the same as when I got them (except for some stains). These covers will last me through the next few babies, I'm sure of it! My only complaint is that once your baby begins to push the weight limit it takes a little practice to get the velcro tabs to stick right. When my daughter weighed 14lbs. if I didn't fastened the tabs in just the right spot they would come undone, but it didn't take long to figure out and correct. After comparing these covers with others (my IV and the Bummis original the a friend of mine used), these covers COME OUT ON TOP! PS - I did wash the covers in cold water at first to make them last longer, but it's best to wash covers in hot water to disinfect. I started washing the Bummis in hot water (with my diapers) and they're still holding up fine. In response to the other review....these diapers DO have fold back tabs for the laundry. I bought these exact covers from this exact page and mine have them
