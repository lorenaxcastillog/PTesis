 I originally bought the Britax Boulevard for my son who is 2 and was out growing his regular convertable carseat. He is 35 pounds and needed a seat that would "fit" him. That seat was not so great. I sold it and bought this one instead. I bought the Zebra print. The seat is big and heavy, which I like since it looks and feels so safe. I like that the instructions are attached to the seat so you can't lose them. The seat was easy to adjust to fit my son and very very easy to install into my very small car (Suzuki Esteem). After installing it with seatbelt it DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL... which we all know is safe. Installation was so fast. I love the belt lock offs. The seat is very plush and soft. I love the many covers available. My son sits comfortably in this seat, there is plenty of room to grow, the crotch strap is so much better on this (than the Boulevard) and I am sure we are going to be able to use this seat for years to come. I am so glad I found this. Buy it, you will not be disappointed
