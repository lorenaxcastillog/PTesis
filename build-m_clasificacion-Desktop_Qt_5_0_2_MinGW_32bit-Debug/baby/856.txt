 I purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only, but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well. It is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded. My son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds; both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way. We've only used it a handful of times so far, but I can't think of one bad thing to say about it. We're very pleased with our purchase
