 I ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other Zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality & softness of the fabrics. It's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy. I have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed, so what I did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition. I also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa I have in the room.
