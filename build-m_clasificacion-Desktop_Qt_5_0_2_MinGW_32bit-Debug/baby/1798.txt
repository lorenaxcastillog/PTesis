 I love this product. I got it after taking a shopping trip during cold weather and struggling all day long to keep my baby warm with a blanket. Since I got this, shopping in cold weather is a breeze. The only thing is, as soon as you get inside anywhere, you'll need to unzip the top and take it off, or your baby will get way too hot. I also use it on my stroller during walks, and even in 40 degree weather, my son is able to take a cozy nap while I get my exercise. It's really easy to take on and off your carseat. They make one for toddlers, also, so I may get another when my son outgrows this one
