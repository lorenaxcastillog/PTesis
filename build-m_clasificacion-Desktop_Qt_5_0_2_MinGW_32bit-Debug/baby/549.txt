 We had the forerunner (Diaper Genie 1). No matter what I did, it still stunk. I would add baking soda after poopy diapers, line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners. It always smelled like poop!! One day it broke, so we looked for a replacement. I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one, but we thought we would give it a try. It's amazing. My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench!!! Also, it's so easy. No twisting. Just put the diaper thru the trap door. It's easy to load and change cartridges. This is definately a great buy!!!
