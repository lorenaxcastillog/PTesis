 This nursery care kit is great! Before buying another care kit consider the following points, with the time and frustration you will save... you'll be glad you did. The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times. It is very gentle but very effective. The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use. So much better than the glass and mercury kind. The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby. The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby's finger. Anyone that has ever cut their baby's finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that! The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store. Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you're on the go
