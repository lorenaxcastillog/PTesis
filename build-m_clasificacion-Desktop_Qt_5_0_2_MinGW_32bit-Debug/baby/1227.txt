 Hi, I have no idea if these bottles help a colic/gasey baby. My baby was never like that. I considered these bottles because I hated that my son had to suck till he could suck no more then let go of a nipple so air could back into a regualar bottle. So I started looking for a bottle that didn't have nipple collaspe. First we tried Playtex. They worked but were extremely hard to mix powdered formula in because the liners held exactly 8 oz (also expensive liners). Then I switched to Avent, thought it was my dream come true bottle. Until they started leaking no matter how I screwed on the ring. I finally figured out the problem, the skirts on the nipples warp after very little use. So I ended up constantly buying new nipples and never knowing when we would get a whole bottle dumped on us. So then Dr Brown came out with these wide neck bottles. After some reading the directions and trial and error; this is it: The Bottle for Us!! This is how we did it; you can't use the valve while mixing formula or warming or the bottle will leak. So water goes in the bottle and just the ring, nipple and cap get screwed on. The valve goes in a zip-lock bag. About ten minuetes before the bottle is needed. I but the formula in the bottle in and shake. In about ten minuets all the bubbles are down and I incert the valve and feed. No leaks. I have an aunt who premixes her formuala in two days worth of bottles and puts them in the fridge ( once again leaving the valves out). Then she gets them out, swirls a little, takes off the top, microwaves for 30 secs, incerts valve, checks tempreture and feeds. No leaks either. The only time I have ever had a leak is when I mixed or heated formula with the valves in which the directions say not to do. Like I said this is what works best for us
