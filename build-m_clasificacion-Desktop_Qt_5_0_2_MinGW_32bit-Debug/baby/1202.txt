 My son has had this mattress for over 2 years now and its form is still great.He wont sleep anywhere else other than his bed. We now use it for his toddler bed and I have layed down on it a few times (pretending to nap) and believe it is more comfortable than my bed!!! It is a really full mattress that offers great support for our little ones spines!! That is why we purchased our second one for our new daughter. I know my son isnt ready to give his bed up!!
