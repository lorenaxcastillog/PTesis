 This head and body support is great for a newborn. Our baby always went sideways in her carseat with a regular head support. This one has both a head and body support, that are detachable w/ velcro. And, now that she's 3 months old, we can use just the head support. We also used it in her swing with the body support and now without. Overall, this is a great product and is soft fleece and easily washable. I will probably purchase this item as a newborn gift for the next baby in the family, as it is that great.
