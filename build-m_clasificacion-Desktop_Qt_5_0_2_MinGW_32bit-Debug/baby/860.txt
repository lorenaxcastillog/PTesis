 I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes. Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months. I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months. I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time. The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it. She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash. I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is! It is so soft and cuddly. We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy. Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic. We love it!
