 After reading the other reviews on this product I felt that I needed to put a positive spin on this product. I registered for this item and received it at my shower. My son is 5 1/2 months old and was severly congested. I took the box out of his closet and set up the machine. After the first night (about 10 hours) he woke up for the first time in 2 weeks able to drink his bottle with out me using saline drops and an aspirator. I am continuing to use this product every night and every morning is much more pleasant. As for the noise level I do not find that to be an issue. I don't have a problem hearing my son cry or even move around on the monitor. I feel the noise is actually soothing for the child and helps fade out other noise in the house. I am glad I got this product and would personally recommended it to anyone. I do understand this product is a little pricey but I believe it is worth every penny!!!!!
