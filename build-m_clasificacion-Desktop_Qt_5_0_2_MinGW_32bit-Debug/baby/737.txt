 I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below, and I was thoroughly satisfied. My only complaint was actually with my luggage, as the handle on my bag was a little short so I had to stoop a little while I was pushing/pulling it. Everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever, especially other moms traveling with kids. The strap is so simple it's genious - just strap on the carseat and go! It was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security, but everything is a hassle at security. Just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it's fine. This is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze. Bravo!
