 I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design
