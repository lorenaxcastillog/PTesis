 I have 2 activity centers by different makers (the other is at Grandmas house)so I have something to compare this to. I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15-20 dollars you might have to spend. To begin,the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next. That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer,it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver. The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by. I can't say enough positive things about this Activity Center. I highly recommend it as it is both stimulating and entertaining for baby.
