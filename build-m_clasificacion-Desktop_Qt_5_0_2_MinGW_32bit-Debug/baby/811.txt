 We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough. Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides. (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink. We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl. Our daughter is very happy in her chair. She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all. Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out. that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal.
