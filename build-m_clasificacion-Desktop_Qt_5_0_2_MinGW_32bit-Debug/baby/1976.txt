 Our son was not a great sleeper. When he was born, my husband, mom and I all took turns walking around with him all day and all night. Then we got the book The Happiest Baby on the Block and tried to swaddle him. This would work for a few minutes, but since he was a nine pounder, it did not stay wrapped. Then we got the Miracle Blanket. It was great! We got stretches 4 hours of sleep at a time. We are so glad we discovered this blanket and made sure it was the first thing that we located when we found out we were having another baby
