 We bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline, was lightweight, and continues to be a functional, comfortable stroller for our son. The one feature that I expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined...it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go. I was happy with the amount of storage, but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag. All in all, we are very happy with this purchase!
