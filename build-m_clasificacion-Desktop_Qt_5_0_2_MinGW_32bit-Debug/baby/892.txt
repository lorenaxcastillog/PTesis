 Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work. Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem. I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere. Highly recommend
