 The top clip is not difficult for me to use but my daughter hasn't figured it out yet - which is the way I want it. I've also used it as a booster and I was satisfied with the way the buckle looped through and stayed in place. I also like the strap on the bottom that allows me to add a little slack or tighten it a little. I think that's a really important feature - especially in this season when my kid may be wearing a jacket one day and none the next and also if you use the car seat for different kids that are similar but not exactly the same size. I have another car seat without that and I find that sometimes I can't get it closed because it's too tight and sometimes there's too much slack
