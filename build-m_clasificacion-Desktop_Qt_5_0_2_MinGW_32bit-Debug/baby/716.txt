 I love love loooooove this system! I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago. Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc. With this system, I just pump right into the liners. They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go. I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners, instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm, PLUS a playtex system. Overall, this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true. However, the liners themselves have ounce markings on them. Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner. Easy! I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk (if you store a lot of it). It would get too expensive for my tastes. I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage. Make sure you get two, because each box only comes with one pump adapter. Highly recommended by one happy mamma
