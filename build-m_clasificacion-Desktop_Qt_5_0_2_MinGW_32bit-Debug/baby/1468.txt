 My husband and I over-analyze everything and this highchair is the best that we've seen. We started our son on solids at 4 months, which was before he could sit up by himself, and has worked flawlessly ever since. The tray easily slides on an off, even one handed. The cover is easy to wipe down, the tray stores itself on the back of the chair, the harness straps are secure, and when it folds, it really is a "space-saver". The leg separator was annoying at first, but we found that it is detachable (the foot rest is as well).
