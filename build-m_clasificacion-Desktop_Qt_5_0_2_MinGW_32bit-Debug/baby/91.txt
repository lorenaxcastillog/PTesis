 We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered. Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered. On route the formula fell off a UPS truck and was lying in the street for over a day. A neighbor saw it and gave it to us. Baby Because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it. We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day. They said it wasn't our concern and to just give it back
