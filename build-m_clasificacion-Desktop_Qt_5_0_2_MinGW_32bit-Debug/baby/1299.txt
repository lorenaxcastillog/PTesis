 I loved the fact that this folded in half so that it gives you more space in your trunk for groceries. It is soooo narrow that it can fit in between any ailes in stores. It is really easy to open and close. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to lift the infant seat up every time I wanted to get to my diaper bag underneath. The basket is soooo small and very hard to get to when the infant carrier is in place so I would put my cell phone, keys, and wallet in the three pockets on the handle and that solved the problem
