 I just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs. My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs. However, gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative. We considered this model and the Evenflo "Top of Stair Gate". After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking. If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit. Also, why take the chance with safety? Anyway, here are a few things to consider when installing this item: 1. I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only. This is a must do. It would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall. 2. Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through, use longer screws than the dinky 1/4" to 1/2" screws that are provided in the kit. I went with 2" screws for additional strength. 3) Installation isn't that big of a deal. Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls. I found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet. It wasn't a five minute job but it was not hard at all. I'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog.
