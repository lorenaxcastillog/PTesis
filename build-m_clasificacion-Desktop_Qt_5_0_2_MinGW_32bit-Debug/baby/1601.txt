 I love these bottles and so does my son. They really do keep the gas out. And the nipple is great when you are also breastfeeding, my son didnt seem to notice the difference. The only problem though, is the measuring... I'm fine now that my son drinks regular milk, but when I had to mix formula it was hard. You can actually only mix 6 oz. of formula in the 8 oz. bottles. What I ended up doing towards the end when my son was beginning to drink 8 oz., was mix the formula in another container or bottle and then transfer it to the playtex. Other than that its great not having to wash bottles over and over
