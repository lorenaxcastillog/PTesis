 I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating
