 I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops. It does do those things but it is hard to clean. It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of. I used it twice and will never use it again. I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done. They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table. I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did. Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier. You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag.
