 I ordered this monitor to listen for my mother who is unable to get around because I am unable to sit with her every moment. I wanted to be able to have some freedom to roam around another room and be able to listen for her in case she needed me. The monitor wasn't that expensive, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised that this monitor picks up every noise in the room. There is also a clip so you can attatch it to yourself and not be contained to one room of the house. It can either be plugged in or ran by batteries. I couldn't be more pleased with the monitor. I would recommend it because it is worth every cent
