 I bought these for my twin boys after about two weeks of washing a mountain of "regular" bibs. I started using them when they were about 7 months and have used nothing else since. Now that they are ten months and self feeding, they have saved me from doing tons of extra laundry. Their clothes rarely have any stains. I love that I can just rinse them after each meal and either put them in the dishwasher or hand wash them at the end of the day. They make mealtime so much easier. One of my boys loves to rip off his bibs, but he can't budge this one!! They also love to fish out any dropped food from the trough and try again to get it into their little mouths. Everywhere I take the boys I get such positive feedback on them.
