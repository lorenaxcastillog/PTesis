 My daughter is 6 months old and has been standing since she was 4 months old. The evenflo classic Johnny Jump up is her favorite thing to play in. It has strenghtened her legs which has really helped her learning to crawl. The jump up allows her to be more independent and she can use it in any doorway with crown molding. This allows her to hang out and watch mommy in every room. The jump up is easy to assemble and is very strong as well as safe. It is made of washable material and easy to put up take down or pack for traveling. I have one at home and one at grandma's house. It is also very affordable. I would give it ****
