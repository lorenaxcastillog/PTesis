 I have placed the stinkiest and most foul diapers in this diaper pail and TRUST ME It works! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I do have to change the garbage bag once a week and I feel that the bag is only 1/2 to 3/4 full. I read the others reviews about the odor seeping out, but that hasnt happened to me. My husband even throws diapers in this pail unwrapped (poop hanging out everywhere) and we have not had any odor problems. I think this is a wonderful buy
