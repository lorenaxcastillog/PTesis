 I carried my first child everywhere in this. She didn't care for the stroller and who would? With the hip hammock she was carried around, able to see everything at eye level (instead of looking at everyone's knees) was close to mommy (or daddy) and got cuddled constantly. I would walk the mall for hours with her in there, She slept in it and I could sit down with her in it and rest or even feed her. I loved that I never needed to take it off, but even when I did it's so simple! The trick to getting it to fit well is to make sure the waist strap is very snug and the child should be slightly in front of your hip, not actually on the side. I put my girl in, make sure she's evenly positioned in the middle of the "seat" and then pull her closely to me while adjusting the shoulder strap. You do have to pull it nice and tight, but not so tight that it rides up on your neck. I recommend trying it at home at first and getting it just how you like it-then only undo the front strap to take it off. Otherwise you will have to pull at front and back when you're "out" and that's difficult. I found the best positioning for baby and mom is to have the baby's back arm under the mother's arm which is then draped over the child's back and can then easily "hold" the bottom of the hammock or just hang free. I found that I didn't actually have to "hold" my daughter while she was in the hammock. My big complaint is that the strap gets twisted in the padding and eventually there is no fixing it. I wish they would put a non slip gripper on the bottom of the strap so it doesn't slip toward your neck. I think this would fix the bunching of the padding that happens. However, I loved this thing so much that I'm just going to buy a new one for my second child. I know I will get my money's worth! It saves my back and shoulders. I have tried the front carriers and just can't stand to have them on for more than 15 minutes. [...]
