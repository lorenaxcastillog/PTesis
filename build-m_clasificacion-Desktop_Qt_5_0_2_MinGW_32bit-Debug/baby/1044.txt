 I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son. We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size. He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. One reviewer said the sprout was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable sprout and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull of the sprout and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him focus on going potty. I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair
