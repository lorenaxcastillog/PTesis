 I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.
