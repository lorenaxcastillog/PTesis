 I have tried many other brands of pads and so many of them leaked and barely held any milk. I've also dealt with fuzz sticking to my nipples from one brand. I tried the medium and heavy of these and they worked great. I can wear them all night, or all day at work, and have no leaks. I used the ultra thin ones when I was leaking a little and they worked fine, although I'm sure they wouldn't work if they had to be in for very long. They are visible through clothes, but I haven't found ANY that aren't. I read reviews of so many who don't like them, but for me, they are the best that I've found.
