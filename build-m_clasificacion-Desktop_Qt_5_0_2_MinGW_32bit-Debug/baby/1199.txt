 I bought two of these seat savers for my Honda Odyssey to accommodate Britax Marathon carseats. Yes, the bases are wide, but isn't that the point? The non-slip surface on the underside grips the leather very well and my car seats have no slip and slide when latched in and secured. The front flap is great for keeping melting snow and ice and general muck from my kid's shoes off the front of the seat. I wished I'd bought a third for the infant car seat!
