 I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same. 1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything. My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray. 2. It is a cleaning nightmare. I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair! Good points: -pop off tray -divider that keeps them from slipping out -cool colors I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less
