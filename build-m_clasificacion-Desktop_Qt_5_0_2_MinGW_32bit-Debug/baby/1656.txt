 I purchased this stroller for my newborn and a 2-year-old. I originally planned on getting a tandem (front-to-back) stroller, but when I test-drove it at the store it felt like a huge, long, heavy and clumsy tank (and that's without the kids in it!) There is no way I'd be able to maneuver the tandem stroller on the busy city streets. Then I tried this Aria Twin Side-By-Side stroller, and it felt so much better then the tandem - it was so light and easy to maneuver. So I purchased it, and I really like it. It says that the stroller is from 6-month-old and up, but I successfully use it with a newborn - the seat reclines almost fully, and the newborn lays in it and sleeps. This stroller fits through all standard doors and most supermarket isles. The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff. Walking in the city with my 2-year-old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller. The only major downside of this stroller is that it doesn't hold a car seat.
