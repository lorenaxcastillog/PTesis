 I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked, my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work. I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus. My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy
