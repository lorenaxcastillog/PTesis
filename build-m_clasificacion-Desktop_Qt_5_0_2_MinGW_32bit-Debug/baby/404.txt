 I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child? My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me. I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though
