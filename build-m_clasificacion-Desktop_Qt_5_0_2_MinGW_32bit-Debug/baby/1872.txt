 I LOVE this product and actually contacted the company to let them know. Here is a copy of my communication to them: "I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for making such a superior product. As a mother to a 2 ½ year old and an 11 week old, I own several thermometers and performed my fair share of temperature readings. A few months ago I purchased your QuickRead digital thermometer to keep in my diaper bag as a spare. After using the product a few times, I have decided to replace all other thermometers I own with more QuickReads. From end to end, what a great product! Here is what I love about it:  Extremely quick readings  The shape of the tip allows for perfect insertion  Tip is also flexible, allowing for "wiggle room"  Button is the perfect size and easy to trigger  Most importantly, the readout faces the reader - not the tush it's reading! A digital thermometer is a parent's necessity. Unfortunately, the only way to find out which one works best is by trial and error. I am so glad I finally what I consider to be the best one on the market, and I thought I'd let you know what a good job your company has done."
