 I originally purchased the Avent Isis to use with DD because I was sure I would feel like a cow on the milk line if I used an electric pump, and I had read great reviews about the Isis. After the first two months though, I decided that the Isis was rather uncomfortable to use, and the massaging breast shield kept losing suction and leaking milk out the back, so I started researching pumps again. I knew I wanted a Medela, but some of their pumps weigh in at 8 pounds, and I knew I didn't want anything that NEEDED to use the complimentary "stylish backpack". When I found the Swing, and read the reviews, I knew it was what I wanted. It is nearly as compact as hand pumps, but uses the same two stage action as the more expensive Medela pumps. It is comfortable to use, I've had no problems with leaking, it seems more efficient and in general I just really like this pump. You can use double A batteries to power it, which is great if you are traveling (Airport? Camping?) The best part though, came about five minute ago when I realized that the threads on the Swing match the threads on the skinny Airvent bottles that are the only ones we can get DD to use!! No more random bottles, and no more pumping in to one container and then pouring into another container to use
