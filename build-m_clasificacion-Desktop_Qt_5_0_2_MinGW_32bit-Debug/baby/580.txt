 After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product. I love it! I'm not sure if they made a different model before, but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine (its on the back). Its not rocket science if you follow the directions. I never have problems with the bottle floating. If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float. The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting. It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature. There are no "dings" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me. Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well. As a first time mom, I highly recommend it.
