 I actually had put this on my daughter's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn't wait to see if she'd get it for her 1st birthday. I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too. My daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point. She's only 9-1/2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she'll enjoy it more. My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof. Other than that, a fun toy. After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it.
