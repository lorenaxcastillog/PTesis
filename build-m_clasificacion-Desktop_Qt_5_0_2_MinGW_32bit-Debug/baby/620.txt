 We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them! Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down....she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive....and she doesn't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating. We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages....and they don't work worth anything! The adhesive on those is down the sides, not across the top where it should be, to stick on the shopping cart handle....In fact we've decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart. Also, with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently, we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table! Well done
