 This has been the most convient traveling potty seat we have used. Unlike other ones, it has a place toward the front for your little one's hands and prevents your child's legs from coming in contact with the filthly seat. It is also very compact. We have used it on all kinds of toilet seats and have never had a problem with it sliding of the seat or pinching legs like some of the other reviews state. The thing to remember is that it needs to be placed all the way to the front of the toilet seat so the lip on the front of the folding seat secures it. If you try to place it on like the seats used at home then, yes, you will have problems. When used correctly this seat is great
