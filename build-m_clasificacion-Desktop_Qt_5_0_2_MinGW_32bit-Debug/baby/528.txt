 I've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he's been with us, but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and I a bit more space. I have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer. We've run into a few problems: First we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we've had to switch bed frames for now. Second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since I'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing I didn't want to have to reach in and pick him up. We solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses. Now he has a softer surface to snooze on and I can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him... we'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he's a bit bigger so he doesn't fall out, but for now it works! Hope this helps! *** I'm adding this a few months after use- I like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed, but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times... still prefer to have him in the bed with us!
