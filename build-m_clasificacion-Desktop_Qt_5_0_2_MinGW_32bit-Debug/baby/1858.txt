 My 1 year old went from crawling straight to RUNNING. I bought this harness after I set him down in a store while I paid at the checkout, and he was gone in a flash. Luckily, we were the only ones in the small store. It scared me enough to search out a harness. We tried it on at home and it works great! It comes fully assembled, all you do is click the two belts into place. It goes on like a vest. It's light and soft and loose enough to not bother him at all. He wears it around like a backpack and thinks he's pretty awesome with his new accessory. We only use it when we're out shopping and there are no carts for him to sit in, though. But please use it sparingly - if I wanted a wild thing on a leash, I would have bought a puppy
