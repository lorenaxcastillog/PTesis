 I purchased two gates and couldn't be happier with them. I have two Italian Greyhounds; one is a 13 week old puppy; and it was always scary going out the front door and returning through it wondering if they would bolt out. Now I have a gate in the entry way, so I can go through the gate, close it behind me, and go in and out of the front door without worrying they will get loose. The other gate is used for the kitchen. I can just put the dogs in there when I am busy doing something and can't keep an eye on them. These gates arrived within two days of my order. Shipping was free through Amazon. I could not have found a better deal anywhere! They were super easy to put together and install. I had both of them unpackaged, and installed within 15 minutes. No tools necessary. And they are very sturdy, and look good, too! It took me a few times to figure out how to easily open the swing door, but once you get it, it is really easy. This is definitely one of the best purchases I have ever made through Amazon
