 Okay, maybe I should have read the laundering instructions, which say to machine wash and then "drip dry" - but who makes BABY items that can't be machine dried? How many parents have the time to line-dry delicates? The upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE - the first time we ever washed it. If you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting, this is NOT your product. Grrr
