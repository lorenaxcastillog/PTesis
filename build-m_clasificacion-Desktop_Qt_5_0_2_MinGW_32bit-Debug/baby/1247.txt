 We received this today and when I showed it to my 7 month old, it brought a HUGE grin to his face and a squeal of delight! This is an adorable toy that is so bright and eye catching, along with a delightful vanilla scent. The horn noises that the tentacles make also bring a huge smile to my sons face and will be fun to experiment with the different tones and song producing sounds. I am ordering 2 more for baby gifts for a friend and family member!
