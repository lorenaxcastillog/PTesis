 The Gymini is wonderful! I have used it since the day I brought my son home from the hospital. It helps a baby to develop focus and tracking skills and increases alertness in the first couple months. It then helps with hand eye coordination. You can dangle an assortment of toys from the arches. We never purchased any of the extra ones you can get because I'd just add some of his other toys with the clip-ons you'd use with a stroller. It is hard to find an educational toy for a newborn that can be interactive as well and last! This fits the bill. You can lie on the floor and talk to them about what they are looking at..sometimes my baby is just happy to have his playtime and can play independantly for about 20-30 minutes. It is portable. We have folded it up and taken it in a suitcase with us 5 times now! Because it is so lightweight and folds up easily it is great for travelling. Then you can set it up in your hotel room or at grandma's house and baby is in a familiar environment to play in which gives you some hands free time and baby some fun as well. It has amazed me how much older children play with it to! Thanksgiving and Christmas at Grandma's all the nieces/nephews from ages 4 to 14 were playing with it on their own and with the baby. Now at 4 months I think my son gets a little bored with it because he likes to be sitting up. Yet he will still play with it for a good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me on this, if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea in the morning while it is still hot this is a good thing!). I tend to rotate his toys now so I think this will still bring entertainment for up to a year. Toddlers we have had over like to crawl under the arches and past the dangling toys..
