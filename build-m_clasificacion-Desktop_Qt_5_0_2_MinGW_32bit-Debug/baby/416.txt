 I like the concept of an elevated design. They should make the sides breathable. I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home. This has been 6 weeks so far. He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such. Typical baby stuff. He ends up slidding down in between the wedges. I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up. You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in. He slides no matter what. When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge. Good Idea needs work
