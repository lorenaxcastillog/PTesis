 THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER, IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU. I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE. MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME. I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL. THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE. VERY SENSITIVE, I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE (I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP). IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME (I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC). I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE. THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE. TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN. THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT, I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WET!!!!!!, BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON'T HURT IT
