 We started with the tub to seat bath complete universal bath system by first years, but it was way too small for our baby and he slid around in it so much that we switched to bathing him in the sink while we supported him. When he outgrew the sink, we needed an alternative, so we bought this bather. It's a lot like his bouncy seat, which he loves and is very comfortable in. This is much easier than supporting all of his weight with one arm and bathing him with the other while he squirms around. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it's lacking 2 things that would make it perfect. One is a strap like in the bouncy to keep him from sliding down, though he doesn't slide too bad (not like in the tub), the other is that it needs suction cups on the bottom to hold it in place in the tub better
