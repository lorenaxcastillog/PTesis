 I bought this because my 18-month-old grandson whom I am raising started having fits when it came time to change his diaper. This really helped to make diaper changing a breeze. Even though it states you should use the packages you can just put a stack of wipes in although sometimes you have to add water on them to keep them moist but it works like a charm. I always thought baby wipe warmers were just another gimmick because I did not have them when my kids were growing up but it sure helped to solve his problem. Thanks so much for a great product.
