 I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once. This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need. I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort. I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied. Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place
