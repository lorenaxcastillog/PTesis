 I purchased this set to use with my Medela double pump and have found it quite satisfactory to my needs. The bottles fit the pump perfectly, are durable enough to be sterilized as needed and, most importantly, keep my frozen milk fresh and safe in the freezer. The nipple rings, disc caps, and solid caps have all worked well. As for the orthodontic nipple, my son has accepted it from the start and we've had no reason to try another brand (although the milk does come out a little bit too fast in my opinion). I can't imagine having any trouble with this storage and feeding set if you are using a Medela pump.
