 I looked at this swing alot before buying and loved that it was pink and the light but hated spending that much on a swing.We had the jungle swing but she wouldnt sit in it she didnt like anything so I said I was going to try this I didnt care how much it cost if she would sit in it.Of course soon as i got it I put it together couldnt wait for my husband easy to do and she loves it she will just coo and laugh I love this swing and so does she I would reccomend this to anyone looking at it
