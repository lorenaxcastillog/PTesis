 I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn, and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews. And we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl. I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car, but it was a BREEZE. I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes. My car has the LATCH system, and it has worked great. My daughter loves being in her car seat, and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it. I was surprised to read the other reviews, since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat. I would highly recommend this seat to any parent
