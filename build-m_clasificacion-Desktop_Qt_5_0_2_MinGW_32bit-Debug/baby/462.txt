 I got this when my daughter was 4 months old. She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out. But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself. She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth. When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer. It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car). This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from. She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this. This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far
