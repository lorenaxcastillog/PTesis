 I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods. You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top. The concept seemed good and it is a compact size. CONS: 1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again. If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches. 2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods. This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them. I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed. Don't waste your money on buying this
