 I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out. I love these containers for this use. I don't have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar. I gave these 4 stars because I didn't get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer (which is why I registered for them in the first place). It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles. I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer
