 My little one is still on the way, but I can already tell that this product will receive a lot of use. It's larger than the other pack and plays out there and much more colorful. The way I see it, a pack and play is place for the baby to explore safely and the combination of the vibrant colors, cute bug toys and mirror on the 4 sides, and padded mat on the bottom make this an ideal location for baby to safely learn about the world. It doesn't come with the bassinet and changer that smaller models do, but those only work while baby is little anyway. This product will be used for years
