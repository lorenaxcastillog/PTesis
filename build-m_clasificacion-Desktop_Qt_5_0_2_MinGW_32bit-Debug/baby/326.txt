 Seems like a good idea for a seat. I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat. But the opening is just too small. It is not the lack of a deflector. I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one. This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time. This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty. Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy. We are shopping for a replacement now. I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt. We just teach him to point "it" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine
