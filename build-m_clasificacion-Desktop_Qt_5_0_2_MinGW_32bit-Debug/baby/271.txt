 Like you, I read all the reviews I could of bottles, travel systems, baby swings, cribs, etc etc etc. I loved the shape of these bottles (very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding), and the concept of the "ventaire" system made a lot of sense! HOWEVER, 2 months into using these bottles, I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts, drying them thoroughly (it's a MUST with these things), and having to "activate" BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal; wasting valuable time and energy that should've been spent with my family, catching up on laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and grabbing naps in-between (I also work a full-time job and didn't get home till 6 PM every night). The WORST of all of it is that if you don't install the vent juuuuuuust so, it leaks...the person (below) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it on right, hasn't met me - I'm 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap! It's a "hit or miss" deal...sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue...water EVERYWHERE!!! (and they're slow leaks too, so it's not like you would notice right away...it took like 30 minutes before showing) Then I called Playtex to ask them what the problem was, and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material...so, they kindly sent me some new ones. Well, yeh, THAT didn't work either!!! It is a GREAT idea, but VERY bad design!!! I finally threw my hands in the air...and purchased Evenflo's version of the "angled bottle" and now I am in HEAVEN!!! Do yourself, and your time, a favor and don't waste the money
