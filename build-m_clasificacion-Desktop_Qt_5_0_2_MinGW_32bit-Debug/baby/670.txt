 I need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room. It's used for an office and playroom, and it's the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open. My daughter's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell, so I bought this one. It took 7 minutes to install, it's not going anywhere, and it's very easy to open and close. My dogs can't climb over it because the bars are vertical. I love it, am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter's bedroom
