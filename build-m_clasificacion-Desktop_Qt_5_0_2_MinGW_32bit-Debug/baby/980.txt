 This sort of product wasn't available with my first child. It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear, and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going. When I found this Bundleme product, I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child. It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat/carrier. I don't have to worry about dressing him up, I just put a hat on him and off we go!! It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine. So far we have endured 40 degree temps, rain, wind and snow and he's stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time!! Truly an excellent purchase!
