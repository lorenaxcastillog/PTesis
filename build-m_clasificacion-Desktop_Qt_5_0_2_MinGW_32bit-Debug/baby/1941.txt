 We bought two of the Britax Marathon's in the Onyx when my daughter turned 1, was 20 lbs and ready to be forward facing. She has loved this seat and it has been comfortable for her during long road trips. We are replacing it only because of an accident (my daughter didn't even acknowledge the accident she was so secure!!) that completely disabled my Jeep Liberty. We're looking at a booster now that's she's 4 and over 40" tall. I would recommend this to anyone wanting safety and comfort
