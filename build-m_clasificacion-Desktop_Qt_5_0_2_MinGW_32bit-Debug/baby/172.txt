 I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months. She hated it. The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat. She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller. After several months of use, the wheel fell off. Also, the stroller is hard to stear. You need both arms on the stroller to push. If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction. Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers. I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied. This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better. I would not recommend it to another consumer
