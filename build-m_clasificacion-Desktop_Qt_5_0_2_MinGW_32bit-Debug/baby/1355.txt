 My son, who just turned two, heartily enjoys this toy. The only major complaint I have about it is that while it has compartments on both sides of the "canvas" for storing the crayons, those compartments are not easy for me to open, much less a 2-year old. The compartments have an indentation where one is presumably supposed to squeeze and open the chamber, but it doesn't work so well for us. This has actually become a little maddening and frustrates my little one. A small quibble, but it would be great if this toy were slightly modified to make the compartments a little easier to get in to
