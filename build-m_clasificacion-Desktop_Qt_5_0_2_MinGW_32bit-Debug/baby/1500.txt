 My thoughts about this product, I hope they will help you to decide. I had already purchased a Britax car seat that was a neutral color, thinking I'd be happy with that. Wrong! So I return the neutral color and went for the Floral pattern, which I love looking at and so does my husband! The price was more than I thought the "next level" should cost, but well worth it. I spent a good amount of time at the store looking/feeling the other car seats. This model is very durable, good feel of the material, and it's going to last!!! My only disappointment is the velcro tabs, which is a great idea to hold the straps to the side to allow you to place your child in the seat. The velcro tabs are located about an inch too high.
