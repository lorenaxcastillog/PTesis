 I absolutely love this monitor. If I were to recommend only one baby item, it would be this. In 2.5 months, the monitor has gone off twice. I have no idea if they were false alarms or not, because by the time I sprinted to her crib, she had already been startled out of her deep sleep by the beeping of the monitor, which I like. Even though she was a healthy, full-term baby with a 9 on both her Apgars in a non-smoker household and the risk for SIDS is low for her, I have a great peace of mind knowing her breathing is monitored at all times
