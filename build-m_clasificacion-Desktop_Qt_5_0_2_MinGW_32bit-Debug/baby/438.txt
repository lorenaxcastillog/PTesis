 Graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over $100 for something that appears to be made with less than $20 worth of materials. The seat is MUCH too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 Nissan Sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer, but much more inconvenient. The documentation, in my opinion is very poor, and I've installed Linux systems from scratch w/ less documentation... Bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don't completely understand the instructions. Let's not talk about the styling... wasn't black, red and gray popular in the 80's or did I miss the come back somewhere... I hope I can find something better... I'm giving this product TWO stars because it will do the job... but I expect much more from a product
