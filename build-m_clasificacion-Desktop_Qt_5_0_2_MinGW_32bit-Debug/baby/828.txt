 We have these straps all over our house (on every piece of furniture taller than two feet), because we have two "climbers." There have been two occasions that I know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury, as she climbed large pieces of furniture. The hardest part of installing these is finding them. We searched several local stores, with little luck - and a few odd looks, as salespersons didn't understand why we would want to strap our furniture to the walls when we don't live in an earthquake zone. But trust me, once you find somewhere that sells them, buy them up. Once you see how well they work, you will become addicted to testing to see if you can tip your furniture - and will want them everywhere.
