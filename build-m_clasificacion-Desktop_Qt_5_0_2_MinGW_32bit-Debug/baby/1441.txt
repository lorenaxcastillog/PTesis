 Overall this is a good gate. I use it for a puppy, so it's a much more different experience for me than using it as a "baby gate". The intstalation was easy. At first I thought the gate was broken becuase the latch didn't meet and the upper end stuck out farther than the lower ends. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. I just want to make that clear. When you fasten it to the wall, the pressure pushes the top together so that it can latch. Use of the product was a litlle hard. The latch requires you to push in two buttons (pinch them between your index and thumb) pull it to the side (left or right depending on a few things) WHILE holding the buttons. And pushing it forward or towards you. It sounds hard. And at first is. But you'll get the hang of it. Using 2 hands if you can makes it easier. Quality of the product is great. It has withstood a lot. But keep in mind I have a 5 pund puppy not a 10+ pound child. One other thing I MUST note is that there is a bar along the bottom that touches the floor. It is VERY easy to trip over. And when you do, it hurts. Don't let this factor alone deter you from buying this gate. It's a good and relativly inexpensive product and one of the only decent pressure mount gates out there that I could find
