 For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items. This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work. We were wrong. The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners. The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates. Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together. My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways. The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled. Never tried it again. If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns. Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again. Granted it might work for some, but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub.
