 We originally purchased this chair 7 years ago, same design different colors then. After two more babies we thought to get a new portable chair for travel, the new ones come with so much more, or so I thought. I bought one with a removable tray thinking that would be nice and-no way. As soon as our daughter figured out that she could fling the tray off it was a waste of space and made a bigger mess!!!( Now she can throw all the food at once!) I miss our simple back-to-basics chair like this one. Also be careful most of the other chairs are not as height adjustable as this model. This is a great economical and reliable choice
