 For the price how can you go wrong, it is absolutely FULL FEATURED, besides a lot of features of the stroller itself, you get a uv shade cover, a raincover, and a cover for the legs (the boot; useful when it is cold). Easy to open and close, a breeze to push, I can even manage with one hand, baby is happy in it. Only wish it could recline with one hand. The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller, get a bit stuck on ours, but maybe 'cos it is new. Even if I knew that would happen, I still would buy this stroller, it is something I can live with. It is almost half the price of the 2007 models, which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric. The color though is not really what I expected from a teal, it is more of a dirty blue
