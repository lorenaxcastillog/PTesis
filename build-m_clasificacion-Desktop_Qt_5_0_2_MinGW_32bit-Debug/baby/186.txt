 I received a SwaddleMe as a gift. The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son, the velcro pieces didn't meet. In other words, the wrap was too large. I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed. In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top. A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it. It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well
