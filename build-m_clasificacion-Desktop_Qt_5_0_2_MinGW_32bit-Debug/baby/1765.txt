 We purchased this monitor to use in our 2 year old daughter's room. We were intrigued by this product since we were able to communicate with her without going to her room (she likes to try to get us to come to her room when she doesn't want to go to sleep). That was our only reason to buy this monitor. Now, it's our favorite (out of 3 different brands). There is no background noise/static like we had with her old monitor. It also has a rechargeable battery, so both receivers are charged and ready to go whenever and wherever you want to use it. It's very easy to use and quite clear. I plan on buying another one for our son when he gets a little older.
