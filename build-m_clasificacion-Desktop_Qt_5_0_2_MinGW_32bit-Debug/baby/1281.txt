 If you have a baby, you pretty much have to have one of these or at least something very similar. The Bjorn is the original and I think the key to their popularity is the simplicity of the design. A lot of other brands have added things (e.g. pockets, extra buckles or straps, multiple carrying positions, etc.) to try and differentiate. Bjorn has kept it simple. Both my partner and I use the same one (easily adjusts for different size people) pretty much everywhere including sweeping and mopping the floors. The boy loves facing forward where he can see everything. Hope this isn't edited: Look around for cheaper prices. They release new patterns every year and many places discount the previous years patterns
