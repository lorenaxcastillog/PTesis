 I have to say I LOVE THIS BACKPACK. I am a mother of 3 and have used this for at least a year now and have NO complaints! Very comfortable, durable, safe and i LOVE the compartments. I use this product EVERYDAY to walk my eldest to school. NO wear or tear YET! Living in NYC I am not always up to a drive i like to take the subway into manhattan with the kids and walk around central park and there's no better way to do unless you you are sporting one of these. My son loves to go in it and tries to climb in himself before we head out. This is as good as it gets and for the price....well, ya can't beat it. Moms
