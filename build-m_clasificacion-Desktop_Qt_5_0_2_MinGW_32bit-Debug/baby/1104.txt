 This was great for tummy time for us! We started using it right away, both for tummy time and for just lying baby against. It really seemed to help our guy hold his head up and look about, by 3 or 4 months he was reaching for the toys while holding his head up. It was also handy for propping him in when he started sitting up, and I used it at about 6 months when we starting doing solid foods to prop him up on instead of a highchair. We totally got our money out of this item, it is packed up and ready for the next one
