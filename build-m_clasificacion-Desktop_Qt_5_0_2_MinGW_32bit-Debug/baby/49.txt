 Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product. On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock. However, after opening the packaging, there was no key. There were four locks, alright. And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools. With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key. Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately? I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy
