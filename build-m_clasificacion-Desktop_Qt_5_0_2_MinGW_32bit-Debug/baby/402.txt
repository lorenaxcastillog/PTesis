 I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend. However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces. I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue. The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks. With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for.
