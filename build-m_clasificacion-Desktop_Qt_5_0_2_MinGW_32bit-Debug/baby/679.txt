 Other parents told us about these, specifically the vanilla scented ones. Baby #1 was bottle fed and took to an Advent pacifier right away. We used the scented soothies whenever we couldn't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes. Not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent, but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting the bottle ready. Baby #2 was also bottle fed, but did not take to any pacifier right away. We tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the Advent ones too. She eventually took to the Advent. It really is up to each baby what they will like. But these are definately worth trying. In addition to the regular and vanilla ones, there are also various sizes, including preemie, pacifiers attached to small stuffed, plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth...and also easier for Mom & Dad to in the back of the car, the darkened bedroom, etc
