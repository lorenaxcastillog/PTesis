 I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery. After my delivery the bra was too small. With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small. I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery. I thought they were big just before delivery. I decided to go w/ bravado bra. It has worked out much better. It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way. The sizes are more flexable then medela. The strap support is better then medela. I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another. No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding. And breastfeeding is their main purpose
