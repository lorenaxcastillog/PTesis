 After receiving no help from Babies R Us in trying to order this, we decided to go ahead and purchase this without even touching it. It made me nervous, but after reading everyone's reviews, I figured, lets give it a shot. Wow, love this stroller! I am still working on putting the infant seat in and out, but as far as menoovering this, it is great. I have a son who is almost 3 and loved it so much that he wanted to be pushed to his bedroom in it, and this thing went around corners with no problems without even bumping the walls. Now, I know the purpose is not to use it in the house, but after reading a review that this was hard to steer I had to make sure I put this comment in here. This stroller is so much more attractive than the old Duo Gliders', I feel like a hip mom
