 After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably, I returned it. This is one of the few products I've had that truly made me ask, "What were they thinking?" The monitor gives off a loud "out of range" beep whenever it's not in good communication, and there's no way to shut it off. Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it's out of range even when it's just in the next room, and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep. But that's the least of it. The voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit, or not. This is annoying, but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room. And finally, the transmission is absolutely unintelligible: it's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound--speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor. In short, in no respect is this a functional product
