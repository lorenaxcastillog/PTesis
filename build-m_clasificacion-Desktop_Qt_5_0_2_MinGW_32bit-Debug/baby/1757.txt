 I love this organizer. I keep diapers, wipes, cream, pacifiers, recieving blankets socks, and a rattle and book on it to occupy baby during changes. it isnt meant to hold very heavy things, so i put those things in baskets on the shelves of the table. it holds the things you need though and i like the plain color, one less annoyingly bright thing that i am trying to put in a unisex neautral room.i have had no problems with the straps like other readers have. well worth the money, great timesaver and also a great babyshower gift
