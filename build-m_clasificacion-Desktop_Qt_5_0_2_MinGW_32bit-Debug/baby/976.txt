 I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower. The products lather up really well and they smell great! They are gentle and they don't make my daughter get a rash. You get a lot of product for the price too. My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold. Now that my daughter is teething, she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin. The moisturizing stick works great for this. We love this gift set and would recommend it.
