 This thing is awesome. We even took it to the restaurant with us before my child could sit up on his own. We didn't want to leave him in the car seat for an hour because (1)he would get restless and (2) the babies can get flat spots on the backs of their heads from frequent pressures of car seats/swings. The Bumbo allows you to sit your child (if they are unable or unstable sitting on their own) in front of you so you can face them and interact with them without having to support them. We took our child to a baby class and all of the babies had one of these. It really helped free up parents' hands so they could play with the children versus holding them up. Someone was really thinking when they made this product. Get it. Don't think twice. You won't regret it.
