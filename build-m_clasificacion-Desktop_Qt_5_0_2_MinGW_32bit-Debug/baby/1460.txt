 My 4 year old son just didn't fit at our new kitchen table and chairs. We tried phone books, but they moved and ended up on the floor half the time. We pulled out his old hard plastic booster seat but he was just too big for it. I purchased the Cooshie Booster and it is perfect!!! He fits in it with lots of room (and he's a big kid), its not at all as small as the standard plastic booster seats and the super soft material really is great! Awesome product that I highly recommend for bigger kids, since it does not secure onto the chair or have a seat belt, I won't use it for my 20 month old daughter.
