 We purchased Britax Bodyguards for our children when they first came out because they were the first booster to provide side impact protection for their heads, just like the more current Parkway model. I had the same complaints as others at first about the seats impeding the kids' views, but they quickly grew accustomed to the seats (and I loved that their heads were well-supported when they fell asleep on long trips). Last week, my daughter and I were in a car accident where we were blindsided from the right. Thanks to those 'wings' around her head, she doesn't seem to have suffered any injuries from what was a serious collision. I bought new Parkways for each of the kids the day after the accident, as I wouldn't want my kids to ride in any other booster seat
