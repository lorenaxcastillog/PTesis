 I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair. The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a "rocker", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!
