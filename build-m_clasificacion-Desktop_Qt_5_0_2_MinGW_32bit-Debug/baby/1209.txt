 My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital. Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets. He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old. I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security. He was never able to sleep without being in it. He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack. We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it. That is how much he loves his sleep sack. It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son
