 We started out really liking this seat. Its colors are not horrid like most of the others, and it doesn't cry "I have a baby!!". It just looks nice and stylish. Also, our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat. HOWEVER, the #1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts. First, you clip them together at the baby's midsection (easy). Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom, so you can clip them (as one) into the female end of the lap belt clip. This is easier said than done, as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them (as one) into the other part of the belt clip. It's hard to explain properly, but really, it's not easy to do, especially if you have only one hand free. Second, the belts get twisted. The 2 pieces at the base of the belt, which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip, they get reversed because the belt twists. Think of taking your seat belt in your car, and somehow twisting the belt itself, so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way. If this has ever happened to you, you know what I mean, and it's a pain to fix. Just like with this seat. It seems to get screwed up effortlessly, but then to fix it takes several minutes. FORGET THIS THING!! We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego, after we used a friend's when we went to visit them for a long weekend, and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did. The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it... Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room. Yes, it cost us about $100 more, but it's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it's time for the standard (non-infant) car seat
