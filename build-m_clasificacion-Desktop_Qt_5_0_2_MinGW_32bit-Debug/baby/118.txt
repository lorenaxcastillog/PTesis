 We received this toy as a gift when our son was born. It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries. When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break. I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all. Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate. I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them.
