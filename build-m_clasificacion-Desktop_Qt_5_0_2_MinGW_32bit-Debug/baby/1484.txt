 My son was very fussy when he was new and had lots of gas. I had about seven or so of these bottles from an inlaw. I decided to use them and no gas and no more fussy baby. I continued to use them up until this month. I have no time for bottles with so many parts. My son is crawling and pulling up..so I am busy all the time. The bottles are great!!! I never in the seven months had a leak problem the wasn't strickly human error (mostly by my husband). It is a good idea to put them back to gether when clean they do consume time if you are in a hurry. You can buy replacement parts in my area( the nipple and bottom seals). Great bottle, Great buy!!!
