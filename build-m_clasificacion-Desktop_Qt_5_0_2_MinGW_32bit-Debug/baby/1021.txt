 My daughter loves it. I got it for her at 4 months. Like the other users, I just put a blanket around her until she balanced better. She likes the sounds it makes when she bounces on it, its not too bouncey though so it helped her learn how to stand and built up those leg muscles. She loves turning around in the rotating seat and can get the ball going really fast. She likes the mirror because she can reach it to adjust it and chew on the zebra if she wants. She is fascinated with the seesaw toy that clicks as she moves it from side to side. She will spend hours in this toy. The piano is a little hard to reach but at 6 months she can hit it easily now.
