 This activity mat was expensive (I bought it full price at almost $60) but there is a lot of usage in it. I started using it with my baby when she was 2 months old, she enjoyed seeing the colorful toys above her. As she grew, she loved being on her tummy with the colorful mat, especially the crinkling leaf. The attached toys were excellent themselves and I used them to clip onto her carseat and crib. Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat. My only criticism is of the "musical" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted. ALso, the sun-mirror comes off easily and is hard to prop up. Again, this is well worth it and a well designed toy for any infant.
