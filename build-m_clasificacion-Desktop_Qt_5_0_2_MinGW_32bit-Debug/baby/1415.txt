 I got this for my sister and her new born boy. Like any new mother she was afraid to leave the baby alone for even a minute. For her to be able to leave the room and go to the bathroom or get something to drink or get the mail and still keep watch on the baby - that is such a mental relief. For her and her husband. The picture is very good quality. She has had no problems with interference from other devices on the same frequency in the area.
