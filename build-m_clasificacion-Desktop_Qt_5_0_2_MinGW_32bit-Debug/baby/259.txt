 I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received. However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old. My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz. He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion. His head rolled around or rolled forward. I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work. Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter. I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.
