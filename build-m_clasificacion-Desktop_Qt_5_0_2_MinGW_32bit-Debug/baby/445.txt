 I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper. It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed. I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame. They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise. Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies. The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious. There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though
