 I thought these would be great specially for the $ but I was soo WRONG!! I've only washed them once, to have everything clean b/f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls!! The fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls, way to many to even remove by hand- And on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam!!!It looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand-me-down after one wash!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!
