 $52.00 less weighted down by cash, and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target. Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like "clear reception" and "no interference" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond. We hooked it up in short order, turned it on, and *SCREEEECH*. Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever. We tried shutting that monitor off, and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away. No screeching, but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can. Totally distorted, useless. You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom. We've packed it carefully back into the box, and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight. Needless to say, I'd steer clear of this one. Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg
