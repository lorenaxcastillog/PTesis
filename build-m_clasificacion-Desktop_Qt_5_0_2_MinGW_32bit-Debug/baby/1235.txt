 This ducky is so cute, and really useful! I got it for my daughter when she transitioned into the big tub. I love that you can lift his shower cap and get LOTS of bubbles right out of the faucet! My daughter, who is 6 months old, is fascinated by the ducky, and I feel safe with her grabbing at the faucet and getting close to it, now! I had a little trouble getting the duck to fit over my faucet, but I just soaked it in hot water for a few seconds, and it went on very easily! GREAT PRDUCT! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!
