 These bottles actually came with my pump and I had never used them. My daugther made it clear very early that she preferred me to a bottle and refused all bottles and pacifiers. She does know how to use a sippy, and will take one no problem. Recently, I pumped some milk to take with her when her grandmother was going to watch her for me. This is the first time I had pumped since she was really little, and I had gotten rid of all the bottles that fit the pump, besides these. I had meant to give them to my sister but forgot about having them. I pumped into the bottle to take with, and Mom transferred it to a sippy there. When it was time to go home, there was still a lot left and it was transferred back to the bottle to come home. It was placed in the fridge and I had planned on giving it to my older daughter today so it wouldn't go to waste. When I went to get it, I could't find it and I discovered Kathrynn sucking away at it. She had almost totally finished the three ounces. One of her siblings had decided to be helpful by giving her the bottle and an oatmeal cookie. I was floored seeing her actually using a bottle. And it wasn't because she was desperate. It hadn't been that long since she had nursed. She absolutely loves this bottle. I tried again later with a bit of pear juice and she took it no problem although she pushed away any other nipples I handed to her. I had no problems with this leaking. I'll still stick with sippys. I have more of those, and it just seems silly to go buy a bunch of bottles and nipples when I would be taking her off bottles in four months anyway. But I definitely recomend them. My sisters little guy really likes them too, which is why I had meant to give them to her. These are the only bottles she uses, and she does use formula.
