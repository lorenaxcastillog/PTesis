 This is a great product. It takes a little practice to get the right amount of water. Disposables take much less b/c they tend to trap the steam, etc. I don't see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true. Sure it boils the water - it has to make steam! But why would you reach inside there? There is no reason I can think of why you'd ever need to do that. And with the first 2 children we used this on, I've never had a bottle even become remotely stuck, snug, you name it - not even close - so don't worry about it. I've used Avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as Playtex disposable bag bottles. It's not really a good use of money if you're just using formula - just make it with warm water. But if you're nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night, this is a must have...
