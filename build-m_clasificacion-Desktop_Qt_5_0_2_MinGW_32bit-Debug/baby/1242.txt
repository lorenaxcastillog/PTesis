 After doing our pre-baby research, we registered for and received this set. We started using it with no problems, and then my daughter started having problems with gas. Naturally, we blamed it on the bottles. Many bottles and wasted dollars later, we returned to the Premium Nursers and have never looked back. In fact, the more I watch other moms with other bottles, the happier I am. Sure, you spend a few extra bucks on liners. But the time and energy and dishwasher costs you save are well worth it. We have 4 bottle shells that we use and about 10 nipples. The shells rarely get dirty and so rarely have to be washed. Likewise for the rings and caps. We usually run a load of nipples with the dishwasher every day and that's it. Empty liners pop out with no mess and are recyclable to boot. When we go out, I pack 1 pre-assembled bottle, and an extra liner and nipple/ring/cap setup. It weighs nothing and takes up way less space than multiple bottles. On the fly I can just pop out the dirty liner, throw it away, pop in the new one and screw on the new top. As an added bonus - I think my husband may actually have invented this ingenius use for the Premium Nurser. Note: this can only be done with the Playtex brand liners, not generics. When my daughter was struggling with swallowing too much air, my husband figured out that we could fill the liner with the desired amount of milk, screw on the nipple, and then squeeze all of the air out of the liner, collapsing it down until it was vacuum-tight with only milk in it. Keeping a finger over the nipple hole, pop on the airtight cap. Voila - a completely air-free meal for baby. This really helped cut back on her air swallowing. Generic liners work fine for all other purposes. Last but not least, we like so many other parents, felt that many brands were drowning our daughter in milk. The Playtex slow- flow nipples worked great for her. She is still using them at 4 months
