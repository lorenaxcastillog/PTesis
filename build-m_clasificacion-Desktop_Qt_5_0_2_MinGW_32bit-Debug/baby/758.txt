 I bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind, which I love, come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin. Some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often - you really are supposed to do that, because otherwise you will get an breast infection, especially if you live in the south where it's warm and humid. I recommend the ultra thin pads, the other ones that come in the variety pack are just "OK"
