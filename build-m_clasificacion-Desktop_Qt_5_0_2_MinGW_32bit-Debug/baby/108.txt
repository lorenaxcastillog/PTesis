 We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit. She's had gas and discomfort with all of them. I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas. But they leak horribly. Sometimes it's a few drops. But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula. A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt. The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast! I tried every suggestion given to me: mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles; wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples; making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc. I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue. Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!! These are the worst on the market in my experience.
