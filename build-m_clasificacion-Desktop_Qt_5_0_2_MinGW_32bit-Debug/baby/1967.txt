 Being an inexperiennced new mom, I had no idea that "Porta Crib" meant a speciality sized crib and not standard size (52 X 27). I just figured it was some kind of name brand among all the others. No where on the detailed page did it describe the measurements, so I assumed standard. I registered for this and was so excited until I tried to fit it on and it was too small! So basically, I just wanted to warn new moms or moms who didn't know~this will not fit standard cribs. However, the bumper is ever cuter in person then on the photos(a good thing), but the crib sheet is very thin/cheap (bad thing)
