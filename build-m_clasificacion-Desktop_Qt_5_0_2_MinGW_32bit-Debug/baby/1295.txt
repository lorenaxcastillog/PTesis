 Fisher price (FP) designs many bouncers, but this style is the best due to the leg design. Some of the FP bouncers have very stiff legs so they do not bounce easily. The legs curve/bow out from the seat (check out image of product). Because of this leg design you can easily place your foot and bounce the baby. My baby will fall asleep with me bouncing and then I turn on the vibration and leave her be. I wasn't crazy about the PINK design, but I know the leg design is offered with a Bunny print as well, but that appears to be discontinued. The key thing is to find the FP bouncer that has the legs that curve/bow out from the seat base
