 When your infant is crying because he's hungry and you're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed, you will not necessarily hear the very quiet "click" another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit. Did it already cycle through once? Twice? I don't know. I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out. Yes, it was in plain sight, but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time. What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there, reagrdless of it being 4oz. or 8oz., makes the formula very HOT. Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions. Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby. This went in the trash. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil. Otherwise, I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem
