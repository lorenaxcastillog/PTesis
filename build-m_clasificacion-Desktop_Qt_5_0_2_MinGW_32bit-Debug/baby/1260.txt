 I bought this sling after reading the different reviews on this page. After reading the instructions a lot of the problems others had were taken care of. For one thing when you use it as a sling the letter "P" will turn over and face your shoulder. To make sure the cord stopper does not loosen the instructions tells you to tie a knot in the remaining length of the cord. My son loves to be held. We were in Children's hospital for 10 days and I held him a lot to keep the monitors from going off. So now he loves me to still hold him. This sling allows me to hold him and do other things. One important thing is to play with my 3 year old son.
