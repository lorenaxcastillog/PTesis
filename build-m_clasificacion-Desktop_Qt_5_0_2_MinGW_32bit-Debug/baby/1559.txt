 I used this potty for my daughter and had no problems. She loved going on it. As with all potty training, everyone has different experiences and always will. For us, this potty was just fine. No bells and whistles which was great because my daughter had the Royal Potty and instead of concentrating on the concept she was too busy playing with the sounds. This is a basic potty and it worked perfect for us. We also placed it right next to a basket of books :-) Good Luck
