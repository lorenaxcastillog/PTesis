 I had the original Pump in Style for my first two boys. Got rid of at after second baby Thought we were done. LOL another story. Anyway I bought the Harmony in case I needed to buy a Pump in Style again and could use the same sheild and bottles. I've had it in use for 3 months. Pump about 3 times a day. Just had surgery yesterday and had to kick up my supply so I had 10 feedings stockpiled, in addition to pump and dump for 24 hours straight afterwards. I bought two when pregnant because I wasn't sure how they would hold up. This little Harmony pump has held up great. I have only on in use. It's a breeze to clean and assemble. It's great in that I'm not tied to a machine and can move about the house. Highly recommend this little pumper
