 Before my daughter was born, I knew I was determined to breastfeed her. I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were. Several people mentioned this nursing stool. I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be, but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly, so I went ahead and bought it. In the weeks prior to my daughter's birth, my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work. After my baby was born, I set up a little nursing station in my living room, and I found the stool to be an essential item. Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position. I also used a nursing pillow, and between the pillow and the stool, the whole experience was actually very comfortable. I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position. I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies, and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby
