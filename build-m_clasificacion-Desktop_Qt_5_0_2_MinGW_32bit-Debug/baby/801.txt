 So far our 7 month old son likes this toy. He watches the flashing lights, listens to the music and noises, and seems to like the different shaped blocks (we have several other peek-a-boo blocks). He uses the handle to push the bus, flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on. It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time. We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn't flash. Well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing. It also made the hood stay shut better. So maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem
