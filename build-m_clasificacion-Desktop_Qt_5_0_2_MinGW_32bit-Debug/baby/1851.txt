 They are soft and pretty colors. Very absorbant. I started off with prefolds and covers and moved on to contours. MY baby has had chubby legs from day one and these leave no red marks... As some of the fitteds tended too.. I love to use these, they are fun and easy to use. I have no problems with the Snappi and these. Sometimes I even let her run around without a cover and just the kissaluv and snappi. Pretty reasonably priced. Easy to wash and dry. They do tend to get folded up in the dryer, so I go in midway and unfold them and continue to run the dryer and they work well. Excellent fit. I use the med/large ones on my 24 pound baby. She was able to fit into the small ones even until she was about 20 pounds. A close fit, but they fit. The med/ large ones are a better fit for her. They are nice and trim and you can use them inside a pocket diaper too. I would use them again... I would recommend these any day...
