 I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.
