 I have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table, and I like both for different reasons. The disposable ones are sort of expensive, but very portable when I am flying and visiting relatives. The Hippo one is great to grab and go around town, when I am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag. I have had waiters thank me at many restaurants! Just fold the mess right up and clean at home! My son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it, and I don't want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs. This hippo is really durable too, I have used this same mat for over 3 years, (I first got it for my daughter) and it still looks great
