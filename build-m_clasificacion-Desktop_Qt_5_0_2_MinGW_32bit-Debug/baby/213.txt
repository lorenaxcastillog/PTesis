 This is the worst pump you could buy. I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down. It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work. PLEASE don't waste your money....... I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product. If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing. I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
