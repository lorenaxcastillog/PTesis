 I would highly recommend this booster for parents as their children reach the proper height and weight. It's comfortable, light and easy to maneuver. Being able to put the straps across the child at the proper height (adjustable by the way) is extremely important for their safety - and since you can use the straps in the car, they go right over bulky winter clothing without having to readjust like our old seat. I would strongly encourage people to remember to belt the seat in even when no one is using it. It could become quite a projectile during an accident if not secured
