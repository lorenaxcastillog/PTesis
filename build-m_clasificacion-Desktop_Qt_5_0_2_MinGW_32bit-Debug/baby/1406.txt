 I had the pleasure of "test driving" this carrier in the store with my son before we purchased and literally walked out with it. The kickstand is a great innovation that makes loading and securing kiddo very painless. The straps secure snugli and are very comfi. There is plenty of storage room for take-along essentials. The child seat is adjustable so this model will grow with your little one. Best of all my son LOVED the ride!! We walked all over the store as he laughed and cooed with glee. We plan to use this carrier in the rain forests of Costa Rica so it will get a true test of capability. Highly recommended
