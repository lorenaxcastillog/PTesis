 I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink. But that's not how it works. It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat! The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times. Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby. I am returning this item
