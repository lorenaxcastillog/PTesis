 I purchased this when my child was already going on 4 months old. He's a long tall boy, and it being winter time, I haven't had the occassion to use this as much except in church and around the house. Why oh why didn't I get this initially? I had the NOJO baby sling, which was great when I was in my twenties but really pinched a nerve (literally) on me over a decade later. My back feels SO much better with this product. Especially if you are already a top heavy person, this sling is a relief. I love the color, and we'll be going to Florida in two months. I intend to use this at the beach and maybe the zoo
