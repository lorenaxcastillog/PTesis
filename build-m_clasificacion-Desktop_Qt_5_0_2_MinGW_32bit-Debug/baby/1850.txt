 We just came back from vacation over the holidays and used the TOTEaTOT for the first time. It was a lifesaver! I purchased it right before we went away because I had been agonizing about how we were going to manage all the logistics of maneuvering through the airport with all of the gifts were were bringing along, plus our luggage and ourselves, without losing one of our kids in the process! It worked just as it promised. It was easy to attach the suitcase to the car seat. Our son was happy as a clam getting wheeled through the airport. We could easily bring his car seat on the plane without having to lug it through the airport! A car seat is a must-have on the airport for a happy child and happy neighboring passengers! We were able to carry our gifts as carry-on because we didn't want to check them, and we brought a carry-on suitcase in case our other checked luggage was lost, we'd at least have the essentials for our little one and the rest of us. We had no problems with it at all. It had pockets for us to store my son's bottle, and we were able to use the backpack portion of the TOTEaTOT to hold his diapers and some toys. I read another review where they experienced an issue with a buckle, but we had no problem at all, and in fact, I was worried that we were perhaps over-weighing it because all the stuff we had hanging off our roller suitcase (besides just the TOTEaTOT, car seat and our son, like my handbag, and a laptop computer), but again, no problems at all. Just lots of smiles and curious faces in the airport! I'd highly recommend it.
