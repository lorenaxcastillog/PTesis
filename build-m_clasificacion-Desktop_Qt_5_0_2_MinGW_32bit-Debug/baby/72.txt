 After trying almost every bottle, I tried these and waht a nightmare! There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back
