 I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times. This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly. Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks. The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky. My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around. By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's. By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters. I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3. Do I credit the Baby Plus? Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby #2.
