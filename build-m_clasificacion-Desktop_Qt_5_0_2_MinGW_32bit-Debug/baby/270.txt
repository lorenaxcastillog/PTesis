 Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out. For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak. We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.
