 The gate is wonderful--once you get it in right. The instructions don't give you clear enough directions and I ended up putting the latching piece on upside down the first time. The pictures were pretty useless, but once you figure out the right way to install it goes in in a snap. To make it more stable you can keep the gate locked to swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching on it. We had to move our once our kitchen remodel was done and it came down simple and went up in a new door way really easy. The latch itself on ours has to be pushed down as it will not latch into place by itself now but it is a very solid gate. And for being over 2 years old it has held up great. The latch handle can't be opened by anyone with small hands as you have to squeeze both sides so anyone with kids under 2-3 who can open it have installed it wrong. Make sure the latch is hooked to the wall properly.
