 I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was "stuck". They have helped prevent him from doing that any more. However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to. In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone. All in all though, I think the mesh "bumpers" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor
