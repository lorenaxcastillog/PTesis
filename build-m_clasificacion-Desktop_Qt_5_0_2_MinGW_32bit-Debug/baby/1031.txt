 After trying four other models of safety gate, I am happy to have finally found the one that works for me. I use this gate for my dogs, but it would be equally effective for a baby. It is sturdy, easy to operate, good-looking, and as unobtrusive as a gate can be. This gate is not pressure-mounted. It needs to be screwed into the wall on both sides. However, I have learned the hard way that the pressure-mounted gates do a lot of damage to walls, they are more difficult to operate, and they are bulky. If the need for a gate is going to be relatively long-term, I now believe that it is easier to screw it in and worry about patching the wall when the time comes. I've also learned that gates with vertical bars are more likely to be left alone because it's more difficult for pups to get a purchase on them. The ones with grids or cross-pieces encourage dogs to rattle them -- and to jump, a habit that I work hard to extinguish
