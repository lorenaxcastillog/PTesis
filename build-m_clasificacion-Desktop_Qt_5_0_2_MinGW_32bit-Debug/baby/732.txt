 A friend recommened that I try her sling for my colicky baby. Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours. As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax. It was like magic and truly kept me sane. After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us. Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously. When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller. She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile. I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it. Bought another new native and am thrilled. One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes.
