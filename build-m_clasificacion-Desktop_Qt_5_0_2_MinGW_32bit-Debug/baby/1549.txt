 I've had the Essentials bag for about a week now, and I absolutely love it! I had a small size Eddie Bauer diaper bag, and it would constantly slip off my shoulder when I was carrying the infant carrier, which made things more difficult. Not only is this bag stylish, its functional as well. My baby is almost 6 weeks old, and I can still carry all the major necessities that fit in my other diaper bag. If you get the black & gray model, Dad can use it also! This is what I currently carry in the bag: Bottle Holder - 1 4 oz. Dr. Brown bottle, can definitely fit larger bottles in the future Large Top Compartment - 3 diapers, baby wipes case, and small bottles of hand sanitizer and baby powder, disposable changing pad Middle Compartment - 2 4 oz. Dr. Browns bottles and a formula dispenser Bottom Compartment - Extra Sleeper and Shirt, my wallet, and keys Small Velcro Compartment on Strap - loose coins Cell Phone Compartment - my cell phone of course Small Zipper Compartment - Chapstick and Lipstick - there is also a nifty pen holder next to this compartmen
