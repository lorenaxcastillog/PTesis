 I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard. My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it. The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment. So that's very easy to clean. The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots. The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening. The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl. The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!
