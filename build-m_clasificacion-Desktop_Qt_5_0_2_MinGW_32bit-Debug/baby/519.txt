 We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair. I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it. This one has a higher back, reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable (the one I have is better than the one shown. I bought it at babiesrus). It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray. My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere.
