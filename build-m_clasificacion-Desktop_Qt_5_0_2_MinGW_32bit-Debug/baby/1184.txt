 I saw this on fisher price sight and I fell in love with it! I was able to find it @ Toys-r-us store. My 3 y.o daughter seems to love it too! It comes with a carry on so you can take it anywhere. I usually keep it in the back of my suv. It's especially very convenient when there is no place to stop when she really has to go . I just pull over in a parking lot, open it and she sits in it and goes! It helps avoid accidents in her car seat. The only drawback though is that it has a built in cup. It's not removable.My daughter doesn't seem to mind it. I don't know if fisher price makes one for little girls
