 A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system. I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20. I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system. I feel like I am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way. While using BabyPlus, the battery cover clips snapped off. I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover, no questions asked. BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby, rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts
