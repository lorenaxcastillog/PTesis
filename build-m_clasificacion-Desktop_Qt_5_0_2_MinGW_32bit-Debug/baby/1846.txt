 I had a Combi until a few days ago, I loved it but the basket was just too small, it was the net kind. I also wanted a snack tray for my one-yr old son. Also I felt that my son was already growing out of it. I did alot of research, wanted a light, easy-to-handle stroller and a bit bigger than my Combi. I purchased the Aria a few days ago, after ALOT of steering in the store, with my son in it. I found no problem with the steering, as a matter of fact it was so easy to steer, even with one hand. My son has more elbow room in his new stroller, and the snack tray is great. I don't use the 5pt harness much, but the times that I have I had no problem with it. The basket is great, lots of room. As far as the cup holder for the parent, it isn't big by any means, but I never carry around a 32 oz big gulp, so it isn't a problem for me. I usually have a small bottle of water or small Starbucks cup. Unless you travel with large cups or bottles, it works just fine. I am very happy with this stroller, the weight of it and carrying handle are both wonderful
