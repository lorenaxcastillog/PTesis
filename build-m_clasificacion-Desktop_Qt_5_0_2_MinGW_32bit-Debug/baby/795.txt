 This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl (yes that includes swings and bouncy seats). I stumbled across it when they had just come out. She was sitting in it at 4 months. BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it. However... I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding. I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child. It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster (which is a double edged sward! Tough fro parents good for kids).
