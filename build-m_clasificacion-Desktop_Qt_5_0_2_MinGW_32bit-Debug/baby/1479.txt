 Superb solution to the "where will my kid sleep while we're staying at ____?" problem. - Comes in a cool back pack for easy travel - Inflates quickly with included pump - Deflates quickly to save room in a cramped hotel or spare room - Rechargeable pump holds a charge for a long time - Comfy The only negatives I can think of are minor. The pump nozzle is a tad tough to fit into the inflation valve. The bed is a little large for tight spaces. It does lose some pressure over a couple days. Definitely recommended, though
