 My daughter tried several bottles for our granddaughters who both had acid reflux. These are the greatest bottles and only bottles that helped them with the gas and upset stomaches. They also are great if you need to add cereal to their milk because of the acid reflux. The wide bottles are great for this. You should only fill the bottles up to the 8oz line and you won't have any problems with the bottles leaking. I would recommend these bottles to anyone and especially parents with acid reflux babies.
