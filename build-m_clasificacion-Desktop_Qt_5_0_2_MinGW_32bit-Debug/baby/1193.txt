 My son was a big baby, checking in at over 9 pounds and 22 inches, but the headrests that came with the carseat still didn't offer enough support. We were fortunate to have received this product at our baby shower. He looked so cozy with the fleece side cuddling him and he was very well supported. Now that it's over 80 degrees, we've flipped it over to use the cooler fabric and he still loves it. My son is almost 8 weeks old, so we tried taking it out of our carseat and just using the headrest that came with the carseat. But, it still doesn't offer enough support. Once he falls asleep, his little head just hung over the side, so we put the snuzzler back in and he's much happier. It is a bit trickier to get the car seat straps safely adjusted around the support, but after a few days we had the hang of it.
