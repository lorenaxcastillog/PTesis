 My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate
