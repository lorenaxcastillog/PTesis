 I bought this without reading the reviews. The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable. Because it leaked I bought a different tub. In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring. I feel much better knowing the baby isn't going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub. What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it. It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by. Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub. Hope this helps
