 This wrap is soo comfortable. I initially purchased an over the shoulder ring sling and found that no matter how I positioned my baby my neck and back would end up killing me afterward. Then someone at my mothers group introduced me to the Moby and I fell in love. No more aches and pains and my baby loves it. Whenever he is fussy and he sees me take it out, he calms down. It looks complicated to put on, but with a few practice runs you will soon become a pro. I just started carrying him facing out and he is really enjoying it. This carrier is a great investment since it works for all ages (newborn - toddler) and there are so many different ways to wrap it. There is even a wrap for nursing, and one for carrying twins! I cannot recommend this enough!
