 I actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby's cradle (we have two cats and didn't want them to nap in it while the baby wasn't in it). I've used it once for my Pak n' Play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood. Since it was such a nice day I let her nap in in the stroller(it fully reclines) with netting covering the entire stroller. I feel, that for such a low price, this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for
