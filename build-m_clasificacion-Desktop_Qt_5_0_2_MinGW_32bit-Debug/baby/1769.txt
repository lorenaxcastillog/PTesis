 This seat is so easy to put together, place in the vehicle and strap a child in to, it is definitely worth every penny. Safety ratings on this seat are great. It is also convenient that, when the child is old enough to move on to a booster without a backrest, the backrest is removable. Our daughter loves the cupholders for snacks and drinks. She also loves that she can climb in and out of the seat by herself, which is good for her self-confidence as she grows up. We use this seat between 2 cars and it is easily removed and replaced with a simple slide of the seat belt. The seat is even color-coded to show where the belt should be placed across the shoulder and the waist. Definitely a great product
