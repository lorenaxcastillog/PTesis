 This was purchased as a gift for our daughter, but too big to be shipped to us overseas. So it remained at my mothers house until we came to visit. Ever since we put it together (which was very easy) she has played with it everday. She likes it so much that we are placing it in our suitcases to take back overseas with us. Easy to disassemble as well so we took it with us to visit the in-laws in North Carolina, which gave her plenty to do. It also served as a feeding chair while we were visiting.
