 I am completly satisfied with the Evenflo Johnny Jump Up. I bought this to keep at my house when my granddaughter is visiting here. She has one at her house and loved it so much I had to buy one. She gets very excited while jumping and I believe it is good exercise and she has fun while in it.I had one for my kids when they were babies.The Johnny Jump Up can be adjusted according to height, so as to allow free jumping. It is easy to put up and take down and can be put in any doorway so she can be easily seen and she sees us.I am confident that this is a safe product and would recommend it to anyone.
