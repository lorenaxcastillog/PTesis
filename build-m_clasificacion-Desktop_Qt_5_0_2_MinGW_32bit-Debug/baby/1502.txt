 What a great seat!!! Excellent growth for the long term. I especially like the sides of the seat that offer great side impact protection. Also a five point harness that accomodates a child up to 65lbs and 49" in length. The 5-point harness was super easy to use and adjust. Seat installation was a breeze with the latch system included. I bought my seat online at travelingtikes.com who's prices were far lower than any other advertised price by more than fifty dollars shipping included.....right on! I purchsed the tan seat "portland" that best matched our car interior. Im so happy that Britax is rated so well and that their seat is such a household name which made my purchase that much easier to research. My little guy is styling!!!
