 I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size. The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover.
