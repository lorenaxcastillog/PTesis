 I would whole heartedly recommend this product. I tried the diaper Genie and could never figure out how to change out the bag, or hardly how to use the thing. With the Diaper Dekor, I pulled it out of the box and it was ready to go. When it was time to change the liner (which does last a LONG time, I was shocked) it was very straight forward. It didn't even require reading the directions (who has time for that when you have a baby after reading all of the parenting books and other safety manuals). It is a bit more expensive, but definitely worth the extra $10 for the hands free and bag changing ease. Plus, if the diapers sit in it for less than a week it really doesn't start smelling very much, but go over a week and you will start to smell it
