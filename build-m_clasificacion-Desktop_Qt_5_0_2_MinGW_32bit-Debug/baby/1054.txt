 I ordered the piddle pad a week before the birth of my third baby. I wanted to put it in his car seat to avoid the poop blow outs (caused by breast milk) all over his car seat. With my other two kids I was always cleaning their car seats when they were first born. Here is the only problem I found with the product. It doesn't fit into the infant carrier when it is set for a brand new baby. It was too big, no matter what I did it would not work. Not wanted to return a product I was sure would come in handy I moved it to my 20 month old's car seat and it worked and fit great. As a matter of fact after two weeks worth of use it finally got a chance to prove itself when it saved my son's car seat from the milk shake treat my husband had given him. It absorbed the drink and saved the seat. Easy clean up,For once I didn't have to disasemble the car seat so I could wash it. Great product for bigger babies and toddlers, ect....But not for newborns.
