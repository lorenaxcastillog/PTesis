 WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE TO TRY OUT B/C OUR BABY WOULD KICK THE COVERS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WE LOVE FOR THE HOUSE TO BE COLD.. I WAS WORRIED B/C WHEN I WENT TO CHECK ON THE BABY, HE WAS ALWAYS FREEZING COLD. SO I WENT TO BABIES R US AND FOUND THIS... YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.... EVERYONE NEEDS AT LEAST 2 OR 3 OF THESE LITTLE OUTFITS... WE EVEN BOUGHT IT BIG SO HE WOULDN'T OUTGROW IT..!!! SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET AT LEAST ONE..
