 I love these bottles and have been using them for my twin girls since week 2 of their lives (week 1 was spent fighting with the wide necked version of this bottle) Once we figured out how to prevent all leaks, these bottles are amazing and speed up feeding time since baby can drink continuously. HELPFUL HINT for all Dr. Brown bottles: When pulling nipple thru the collar, everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle. Eliminates leaks completely. And do NOT over-tighten collar onto bottle. Again, will prevent leaks. We learned all of these tricks the hard way! :) Mother of twin girls from Texa
