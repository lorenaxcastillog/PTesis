 We received this monitor off our registry. For a long time we never used the sensor pad. We felt we didnt need it. A few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach in the middle of the night unbeknownst to us. We would turn her only to find her moments later, or even hours later, on her stomach. We finally let her sleep on her tummy becuase it was obvious that was where she wanted to be. So the pressure pad is so sensitive that it picks up a 3 month old's breathing. we have only had a few false alarms but that was becuase she was way over in the corner of the crib. Hope that helps
