 I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can't hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby's face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan. He's in an infant car seat though and I couldn't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror. I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest. I'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now. Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn't bother. On the window, it would be held by suction and I really don't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby
