 My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age. I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn't believe how huge it looked! We didn't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big. We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long. At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it. I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future. I think he'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he's 6 months old and this blanket should work
