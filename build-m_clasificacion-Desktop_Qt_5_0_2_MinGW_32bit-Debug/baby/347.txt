 I ordered this through Walmart.Com and received it damaged, but Walmart and/or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide. The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib. So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box. Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well. Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large. I then received the second crib and it was spotless. The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer. I was not impressed. I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib. I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great. I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.
