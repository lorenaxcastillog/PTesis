 We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker. Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work. I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy. I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it. And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes. Other than that, I really like the walker! lol :} I think it will be better once we get a new toy
