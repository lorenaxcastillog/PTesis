 As first-time parents, we have pretty much field-tested every kind of potty training device on the market, from seats that attach to the Big One to more traditional little potties. Here's why we're keeping this one forever, or at least until our kids are done having kids: &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; 1. It's sturdy--no balancing needed.&#60;br /&#62; 2. Also, one-piece construction means no chasing pee out of crevices or finding it in surprising places. We empty, wipe with TP, and wipe with a Clorox wipe.&#60;br /&#62; 3. Facilitates a modified squat position, which makes pooping easier. (Success = compliance!)&#60;br /&#62; 4. Got a boy? Your walls will thank you. This design is more effective than splash guards or turning Junior backwards on the Big Seat.&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; Note: We also have the one-piece Baby Bjorn model. It's smaller, so it works well at Grandma's house
