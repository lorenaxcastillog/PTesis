 We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them. Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway. After only 5 or 6 uses however, the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago. I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem, but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product. They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase (and you have to have proof of purchase). They did offer to send me out a replacement part, but under the circumstances, I don't feel comfortable using the seat at all, so I'll be destroying and disposing of it. I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat, but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem. Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash, or my son certainly would have been seriously injured. We haven't had any problems yet with the other seat, but I'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe. After their horrible customer service, I won't be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again.
