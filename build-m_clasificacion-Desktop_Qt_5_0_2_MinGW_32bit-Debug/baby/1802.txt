 We've been using this cart cover for four months now and have really liked it. I originally ordered it to provide a little extra cushioning in the cart seat but have liked that I can attach a toy to it and stuff a bottle in the pocket. When my son goes through a teething phase it's handy as a barrier over the various carts. It's much easier to throw the cover over the cart than wipe down the entire seat. I like the whimsical pattern--it's so bright and cheery. We're expecting a baby girl in a couple of months and are happy to be able to use this pattern with her also. We've also used it as a highchair cover in restaurants from time to time. It's a little bulky but functions as a great crumb catcher
