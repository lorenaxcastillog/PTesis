 We loved this product and our little girl loved it even more! We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months. We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in. We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped. We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often. At just 14 months, she could jump with both feet off the ground. It is a quality product at a reasonable price. Would highly recommend
