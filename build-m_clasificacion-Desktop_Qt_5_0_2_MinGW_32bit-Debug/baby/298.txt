 I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby. I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive. I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller. It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck. There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright. There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack. They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow. the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep. There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all. For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed. I actually use my orignal "cheap" single stroller, instead.
