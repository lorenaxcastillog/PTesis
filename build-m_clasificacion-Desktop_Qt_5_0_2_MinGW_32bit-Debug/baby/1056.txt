 I have used many slings in the past and this sling is by far the best!!! It is easy to use- and to learn to use. Our baby loves her sling- and settles down immediatly after we put her in it. I can clean my house, walk our dog, shop, etc. and she is nestled safely in her sling. My husband also wears this sling and states, "It is the best baby product we bought!" Likewise, it is lightweight and we live in a very hot climate- she doesn't get too hot in this sling. I used mine every day for several hours a day- and as I write this, our daughter is nestled in with me! This is a must have item for any new mom or dad
