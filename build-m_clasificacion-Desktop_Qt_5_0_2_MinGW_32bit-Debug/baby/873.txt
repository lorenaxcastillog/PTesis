 I ordered this at Christmas with the free super saver shipping. The crib arrived within a week. Assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable. It's attractive, but my only complaints are 1)it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint (this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint) and 2) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps. Overall, I'm very happy with the crib AND the price- can't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in May
