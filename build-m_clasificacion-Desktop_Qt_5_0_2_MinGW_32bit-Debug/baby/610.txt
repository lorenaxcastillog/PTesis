 I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive, since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower. But knowing what I know now, Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it. My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times, the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep. (She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much) Being that it was so used, Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off. The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use. Now that my baby is getting older, I switch her forward and she loves that. She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her. The ease of the clips is a godsend, so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me. I tried some other carriers, but all the straps and clips were so confusing. Plus alot of the others arent reversible. You can only have your baby face inwards. This is totally worth the money guys!
