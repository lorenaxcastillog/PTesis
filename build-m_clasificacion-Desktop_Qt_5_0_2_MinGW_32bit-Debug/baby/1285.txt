 I love this for keeping my plants off limits to my 10-month old son. I live in a small apartment and have a lot of plants. I had a hard time figuring out what to do to keep them out of reach once he started moving around more. This works great! I keep the gate around my plants so my son can't get to them. An added bonus is it keeps my cat out of the plants as well. Even once we move to a house I can see using this either inside or outside to contain different areas.
