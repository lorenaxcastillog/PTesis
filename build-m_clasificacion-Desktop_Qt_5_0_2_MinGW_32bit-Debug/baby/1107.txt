 I sure wish we had discovered this stuff with my fist child for his gassy belly issues because I think I would have a few less gray hairs and my husband would have a full head of hair if we had. But any how, here we are with our second son (who is currently three weeks old) and having to deal with the cranky gassy belly issues all over again. Thankfully my mom bought me some Gripe Water while she was out visiting us and I can't tell you how happy I am that she did. It has made a huge difference for my son. We give him a bit of this stuff and he calms down within about 15 minutes. This stuff really works and really helps. It is a must have
