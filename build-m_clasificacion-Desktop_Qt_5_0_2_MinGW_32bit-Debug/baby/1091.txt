 This is a great seat b/c the baby can just sit and hang out it in while it's reclined and as the kids get bigger it transforms to fit them. Our three year old uses it at the table without the tray. When he found out that the new baby was going to use it, he said, That's my seat! So, we bought a second one. Also, it doesn't take up as much room as a high chair and we've been know to take it to restaurants b/c it's so much more comfortable than those boxy high chairs. And we all know that a comfortable kid is more like to let you have a peaceful meal! A great product
