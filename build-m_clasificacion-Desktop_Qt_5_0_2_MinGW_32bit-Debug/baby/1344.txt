 My daughter has really enjoyed this mat. In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish(she looooves fish), but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased. Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash. As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though.
