 I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly. The two main parts, left side board and right side board, both came in totally cracked. When I called in to order replacements, the customer service rep knew exactly what I'm calling to re-order. ?!?!?! If it's a known problem, why not fix it?! The customer service reps are very nice, but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn't make this product very attractive. The processing itself takes 2-3 weeks. In my case, 3 weeks later, I found out that my 2 parts are on back-order, awaiting shipment by container from Brazil. So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it. I hope the dresser arrives before the baby...
