 I use this gate to contain a puppy in a kitchen area, and except for the annoying click it makes when it is (slammed) shut it was wonderfully easy to install, and is very durable. Reviews of it, however. indicated a number of users whose gate became inoperative (the latching mechanism failed) and since it is riveted in place, cannot be replaced. Manufacturer, queried on this point, tells me there are only a small number of cases where this occurred, and that the problem has been dealt with in changes in the manufacture.) I bought two mpore gates for my daughter, who is containing a very active one-year-old boy.
