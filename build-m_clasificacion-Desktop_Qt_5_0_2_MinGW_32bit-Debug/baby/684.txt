 I didnt know these things exsisted with my first child, now that I found them I use it constantly! This floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper, but in the long run this is the best for your money! I have washed it at least half a dozen times, and its washes great! I also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair. THe other products I saw you had to buy one for each item. It was almost double the cost. It does take a few minutes to get it hooked up, but its worth it for the quiet and GERM free shopping experience, and my son is so ccomfy in it! I have had lots of people ask me where we got it. I love the added extras of having a cup holder pocket and some places to hook up some toys. It is very plush and made of great fabric, it is not cheap in anyway. THis is one item I dont intend to live without, I also think this is a great shower gift for anyone expecting! I cant say enough about this product
