 This is made really well and protects baby well and also seems very comfortable. It is also easy to carry all our stuff, especially when out all day. It is great for walking because it steers really well and is very smooth. But, shopping in stores it is difficult to maneuver down narrow aisles because it is wide. I picked this over the metrolite because the other seemed too wobbly. It is a bit heavy to lift in the car, but I am strong, so this isn't a major issue, but my Mom could barely lift it into the car. My daughter has also slept in the stroller fully reclined, which is awesome for doing yard work in the summer. We have even taken this to the beach and loaded everything into the bottom and over the handles, there is so much storage space below. Baby is also well protected from the sun under the awesome canopy. But, I have switched to a lightweight narrow stroller for taking my 21 month old daughter out on longer trips since she doesn't always want to sit in it the entire time.
