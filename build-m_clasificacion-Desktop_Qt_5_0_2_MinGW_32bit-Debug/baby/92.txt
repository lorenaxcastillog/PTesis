 I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it. My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce
