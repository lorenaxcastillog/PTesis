 My daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and I was always worried that she would get cold, especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter. I saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl! She wears it every night now and I know she stays warm throughout the night. The only suggestion I have for anyone thinking of buying this, is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one. Mine is growing so fast that I will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long
