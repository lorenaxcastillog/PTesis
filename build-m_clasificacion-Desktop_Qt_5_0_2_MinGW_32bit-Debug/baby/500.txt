 I used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son (that doesn't overlap the mattress) and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times. I remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that I was panicked and thought he had suffocated. I was extremely happy when I discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed. She is now two and I haven't had one problem with it. I at one point had three on her bed. I went down to two as I pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open. I have not had one problem with them. I take them off her bed and use them when we travel. I can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween. I wish they had these when my son was younger :
