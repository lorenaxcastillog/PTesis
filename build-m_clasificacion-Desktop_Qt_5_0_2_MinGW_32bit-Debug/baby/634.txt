 When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did! My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies. As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do
