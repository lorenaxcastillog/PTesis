 We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover
