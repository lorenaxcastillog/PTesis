 We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too. I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all. I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23" has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need. I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves. This cotton is so nice and light that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together. If you want one that is heavier, they come in fleece and quilted also, but remember that there are no sleeves. I very much like that the zipper is "upside down". It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin. BTW, if you try to put your baby's arms inside the sack instead of out the holes they will probably get them out the holes themselves - mine did.
