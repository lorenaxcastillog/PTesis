 If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you. First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself. Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out. It's not that easy. The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk. Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there. The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk. This never happened with the other bags on the market. My favorite is lansinoh. Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others. Pass on this and try others
