 this gate actually changed our life, our 18 month old was crazy about kitchen and we had to spent a lot of time being next to him so he would not hurt himself there. Nothing could keep him away from kitchen. After we bought this gate we can let him run around the house without being afraid that he would go there. This gate is very easy to install, to operate and it cost cheaper than others. I would recomend this to all with small kids
