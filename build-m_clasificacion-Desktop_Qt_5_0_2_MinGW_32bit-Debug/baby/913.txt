 Very convenient carseat, can be placed in the combi double stroller, which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into. (and I've searched a lot) The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo (whichI also have) but you can;t connect that one into the Aria twin, the peg perego side by side. The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage, and VERY soft with the foam insert. It's easy to get into the car with or without the base. Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out. Also, our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat, so it must be pretty comfortable
