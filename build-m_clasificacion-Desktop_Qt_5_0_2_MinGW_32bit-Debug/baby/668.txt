 This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained. For starters, kids like using the same seat as mom and dad..this seat allows them to do that comfortably. It is not too big and not too small, fits any toilet and travels like a dream. As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free. And with boys, there is usually a little mess, but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily. I love it, and my son loves it. I wish I hadn't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it..only this seat
