 I used this co sleeper with my son up until he was 7 mos old. He is now 2 and we are expecting our second any day now. I can't wait to set it up. It was a lifesaver when I returned to work because my son nursed every 2 hours up until 6 mos old. I didn't have to get out of bed to feed him and it made him feel safe to be next to his mommy and daddy. The mattress they provide is too firm so I suggest you get a portable crib mattress that will fit. I haven't tried the one I got yet so I'm not sure which one is ideal. I personally didn't set it up so I can't relate to the concerns of others. My husband sets it up and takes it down which is not often. We use a second-hand playpen on trips. He hasn't complained about it. Maybe some sighs of frustration. Still well worth it
