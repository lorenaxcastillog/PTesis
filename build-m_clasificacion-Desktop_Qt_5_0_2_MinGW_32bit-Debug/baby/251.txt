 I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product
