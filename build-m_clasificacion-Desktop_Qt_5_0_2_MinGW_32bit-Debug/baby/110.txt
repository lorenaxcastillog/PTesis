 I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product. With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem. We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples. However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand. The leak is not just a spot here or there. It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap. I know many people who have had the same problem. For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak. Don't waste your money
