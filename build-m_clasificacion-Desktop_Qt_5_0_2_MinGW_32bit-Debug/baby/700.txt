 This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair. I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair. However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything. I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage. Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair. If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs
