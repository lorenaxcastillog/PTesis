 We splurged a little to get this monitor but we are very happy we did so. I sleep much better at night knowing that my baby's breathing is being monitored. The instructions indicate the sensor pad should be placed under the mattress directly under your baby with no bedding or padding in between. However, I've found the sensor will work even through a mattress, bedding, and a one inch thick sleep positioner. It's SUPER SENSITIVE which is GREAT! One thing to keep in mind - You should not have a ceiling fan on at night or have a strong draft in the room (such as an AC vent blowing directly onto your baby's crib). The unit will pick up air movement in the room. I highly recommend this product! I would not be resting at night as peacefully as I am without it
