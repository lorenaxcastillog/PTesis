 We are extremely happy with this carseat. We saw no need for an infant/detachable since we use a sling to carry our baby. One note though: If you plan on using this seat for a newborn, make sure your purchase separate head support. Our baby was small, and for awhile even having double headsupport wasn't enough to keep her head from falling forward. We just tucked a folded blanket under her chin to help give her support. One major bonus, she's very comfortable in this seat. When she went through her fussy, oops I mean high need ;) period, just sitting her in this seat (not even driving anywhere) calmed her instantly! We love the fact that this is the only carseat we'll need to buy. When you take that into consideration, not having to buy an infant and then another carseat later, the price is not bad at all. Britax= quality & safety
