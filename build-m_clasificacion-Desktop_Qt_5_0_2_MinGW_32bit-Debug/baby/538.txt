 I received this as a baby shower gift from my Mom and love it! It is so easy to manuever, you can do it with one hand. The stroller has ample space for bags, purse, etc. below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items. The drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus. The material is so pretty and the colors are great. The best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby, should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather. I would highly recommend this item.
