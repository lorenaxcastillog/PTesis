 I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews. I'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later. Problems: The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park) The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six "buttonholes" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right The shades are very small and next to worthless The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel. It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two. Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway. If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience. A shame
