 This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best
