 This thing is great. We use it to safely co-sleep (you can safely co-sleep; why most doctors in this country refuse to even discuss it when it REDUCES the risk of SIDS is beyond me). It works SO well, and you can just pull the baby down with the little pad she sleeps on, nurse her till she falls asleep lying down, and then pull the pad back up into the sleep nest, without waking her. That has been SO helpful!! I really recommend this to those thinking of co-sleeping. It's definitely a safer alternative than the adult mattress/pillows/blankets. We put it between us and the sides keep the pillows from getting near her face- perfect.
