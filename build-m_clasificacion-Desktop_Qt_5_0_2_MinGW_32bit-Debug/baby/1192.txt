 This support can be used in almost anything (bouncers, swing, and strollers). I bought it to use in my Baby Jogger stroller and it works wonderfully. There is actually a Snuzzler designed specifically for Baby Jogger which costs more. This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost $15 less! I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby's head forward, so I removed it. But she was already 3 months old when I bought it, so it might work well for newborns
