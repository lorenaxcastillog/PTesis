 Going from lugging around a heavy infant carrier to the convenience of pulling this out of the car and pushing down a lever to bring out the wheels has been a glorious transition. It's not the best carseat out there, and is a tad inconvenient in some areas, but the ease of converting it to a stroller and taking my little girl into stores with it, far outweigh the other annoyances. One thing I will say - when the carseat is in the rear-facing position, it does tilt forward a bit for my liking. When my girl falls asleep her head is usually hanging forward because of the forward slant. The seatbelt has to go over the top of the seat, so you have to reattach everything every time you put your baby into it and that can get a little annoying. The stroller part is great though. And it's SO EASY to adjust the tightness of the straps. Despite the small wheels, it's actually a very smooth ride on concrete and bumpy parking lots. Much smoother then any shopping cart with her carseat in it, ever was - lol. I got this as a gift from my mom and didn't think I'd like it, but I really love it now.
