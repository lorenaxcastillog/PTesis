 I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child. I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it. You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere. Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.
