 My Wife and I had twins recently and I went looking (about 3 hours of internet searching and reading reviews) at all kinds of different nursery monitors. I even looked at some costing over 500 dollars with built in wallmounts, ect. Pretty much every thing I read said try this one. Well they were right. Rechargable batteries. Good clear signal even between multi-floors. Durable hand sets with a easy to use switch between the base (the babies room) and the other hand set. Easy to use. durable and reliable. Good volumn control. Good response from manufacture and from Amazon when a switch went bad. Can't ask for more than that even if it cost twice what I paid. I strongly recommend this set and product. I have used others and they can't touch this one. My babies and more importantly my wife's emotional well being were a serious consideration on finding something that would make them feel safe and in communication. After 3 months of continous use, I can't imagine a better choice. It even allows us as adults to have quiet time casue we know we can hear everything even the slightest wimper. Do yourself a favor and buy this. Jay Saldan
