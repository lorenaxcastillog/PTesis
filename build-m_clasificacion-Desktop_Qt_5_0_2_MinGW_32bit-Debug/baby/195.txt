 I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old. I ended up returning it 3 days later. I am a petite woman (5'2") and this item was totally uncomfortable! I still have bruises under my arms from this item. I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual. It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits. I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am. NOT WORTH THE MONE
