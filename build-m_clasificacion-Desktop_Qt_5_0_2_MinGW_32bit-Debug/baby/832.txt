 This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there. The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality. We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased. I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!!
