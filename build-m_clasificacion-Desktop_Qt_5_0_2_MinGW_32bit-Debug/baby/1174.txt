 I tried a couple other slings that didn't work for me. I didn't like the over the shoulder baby holder type one because I could never get it right. I have a snuggly type one which was okay but still hard on my back. This one is lengthy but worth it once you have used it and become quick at it. I found if I want to work on the computer it is great he sleeps on my chest, snuggled up, and I can type with both hands. I have not tried to nurse in it so I am not sure how well that works. I have used it front and tummy facing. My husband even wore it while cooking and found it handy
