 Finally a bottle that is easy to clean and my baby loves! We have been through every bottle out there and wasted so much money that I vowed never to try another--but when my second baby refused the bottle (I had settled on the playtex with my son because it was problem-free) and refused playtex, I tried these. It's the only bottle she will take. She is also breastfed, so I'm not sure if these are just better for breastfed babies, but she has no gas problems with these, and they are incredibly easy. Also cool how the cover fits on the bottom of the bottle so if you are out and about it's easy to find.
