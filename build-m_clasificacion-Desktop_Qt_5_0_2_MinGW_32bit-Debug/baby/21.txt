 I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing. My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc. In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me. What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on. But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing
