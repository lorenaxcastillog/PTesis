 We lived abroad with my first born and we used our sit n stroll for three or four international flights a year!! The kid was comfy and as I was traveling alone with my son most of the time, I found it to be very managable with the sit n stroll and my backpack. Moved back to the states and had baby number 2--used it often as a loaner stroller to the grandparents--when they had the kids in tow--and I still used it for flights here--all in all a wonderful investment- Tips: You will need to ask for a seatbelt extender on airplanes--no big deal they have them--and you will need to raise the armrest to "click the seatbelt" and then lower it for takeoff. Good luck
