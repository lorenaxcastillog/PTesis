 I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable. When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore
