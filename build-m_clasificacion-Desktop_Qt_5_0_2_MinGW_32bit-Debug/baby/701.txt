 I bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son, and he loves it (whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs). It's a great size, easy to use, good color for hiding stains, and comfortable for him to sit in. Best of all, because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag, we can be sure that he doesn't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat! This is an excellent product, and well worth the money
