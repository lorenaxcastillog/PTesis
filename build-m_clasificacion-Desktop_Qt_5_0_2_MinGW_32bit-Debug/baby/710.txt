 I absolutely recommend this infant seat! My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat. It is fabulous for it's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it's roominess. My son is on the chunky side, being an exclusively breastfed baby. He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool. The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying.."what a ride!". Well it is, quite a ride. If you buy this car seat, it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby's life. Thank you Graco
