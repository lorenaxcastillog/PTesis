 I recieved this bumper as a shower gift and I really like the colors and the quality. The only thing is that it doesn't come with instructions on how to attach it to your crib and its not as self-explanitory as one might think it would be. The picture on the packaging shows the pattern facing inwards towards the baby, and no bumper on the sliding side rail so I guess you have to double it back on the sides but the ties end up weird that way. We'll see how it works out, but otherwise its a good quailty bumper
