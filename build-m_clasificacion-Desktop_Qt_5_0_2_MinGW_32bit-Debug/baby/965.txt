 I love this high chair and so does my daughter.It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food.The chair also folds compactly for storage.It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels.It has a height adjustment that is great.I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner.It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older.I love the chair pad, the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean.Which is great for moms since we hate a mess.It is very sturdy and safe.I also like the five point harness system.My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe.I highly recommend this product to new and old moms.I love it!!!!!!!!!
