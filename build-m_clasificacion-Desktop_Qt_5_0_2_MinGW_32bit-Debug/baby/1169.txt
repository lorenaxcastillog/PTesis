 Our first night home with our daughter, we planned on her sleeping in her basinette next to the bed. Just before putting her to sleep, our cat jumped in the basinette, and I was distraught thinking that she would do this again when the baby was asleep in it. Because we have a soft mattress, I couldn't bear the thought of my daughter sleeping with us, so I spend a sleepless night in the recliner with her on my chest. First thing the next day, we went to the store, and bought the snuggle nest. The selling points for use were the size, and the light. It fit perfectly between us on our king size bed, and the light allows me to breastfeed and change the baby without overstimulating her. And because I had had a c-section, it was wonderful not getting out of bed all the time. Two weeks later, I was ready to put her in the bassinette again. The best part was, because of its size, the nest fits in it perfectly. My daughter never knew the difference between bed and basinette. I am planning on using it to transition her to the crib as well. I would recommend this product to anybody that wants to co-sleep, had a c-section, or just wants to provide a snug place for their little one to sleep without worry
