 I have used both Kissaluvs size 1 & 2 with my son, from age 6 months - 2 years. He has never leaked! I never had a problem with drying them - perhaps because I live in a dry climate. My husband loves them too, so they are all we used. Buy them new at about $10 each. I used 2 dozen at a time. My son is such a wiggle worm that I recently bought a few fuzzi bunz pocket diapers. I like them better for his age (2-3 years) because I don't have to wrestle a diaper AND a cover on him. However, they are pricey at $15 each. I'm having a baby this month and bought a dozen size 0 - I will need at least another dozen - but they grow out of them so quickly. I have heard they are THE best infant diaper. High resale value as well.
