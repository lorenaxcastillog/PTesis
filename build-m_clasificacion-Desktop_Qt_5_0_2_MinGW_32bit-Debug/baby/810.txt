 Well, I'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product, but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on. He's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed, but orthopedic giant dog beds STARTED at over $200. We got the idea to try a baby crib mattress, and ordered it. Very soon thereafter I arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable. He loves it. It is well crafted and everything the ad said. Our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog
