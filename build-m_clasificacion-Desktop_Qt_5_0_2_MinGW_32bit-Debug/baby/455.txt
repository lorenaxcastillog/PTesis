 I am using the babyplus system for the second time and am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old. Faith was born alert, calm, and hardly cried at all as an infant. She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat. She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write, sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts. Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble. Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination with activities and sports. I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system. I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again. Do not be afraid to try something new. Just read the studies and reviews, they speak for themselves. You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child.
