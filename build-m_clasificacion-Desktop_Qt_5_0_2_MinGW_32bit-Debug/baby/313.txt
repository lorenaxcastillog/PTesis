 This is the flimsiest gate ever. To boot it is not cheap. I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate. I had to use nails and duck tape. The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together. Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good. So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate. So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled. This gate isn't even worth $1.0
