 I've used this foldable seat for all 3 of my kids now (two girls and a boy). It's so nice to store in the diaper bag (The storage bag it came in has long since ripped so I store mine in a gallon size Ziploc bag) It goes EVERYWHERE. I put it in our swim bag when we go to the pool too - it's so nice to be able to put the kids on it and not have to balance them on the huge public toilets. They're more relaxed sitting by themselves too (which means a shorter wait in the bathroom). I've read the reviews of pinched bums and read them when I first bought this too - just be careful is all I can say. My kids never got pinched but then, I put them on carefully so that it doesn't happen. Just pay attention and the pros and convenience of this seat far outweigh the cons
