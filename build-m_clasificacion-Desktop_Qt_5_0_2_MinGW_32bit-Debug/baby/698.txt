 I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don&acute;t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price. Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed, also suffication could be a problem. We have bought a convertable crib (common in Europe) which can be used till approx. age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later. anyhow we still love it. it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari.
