 I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. Pros: I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. The cons: Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.
