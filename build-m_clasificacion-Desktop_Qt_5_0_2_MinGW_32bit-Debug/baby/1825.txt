 If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day (maybe 2 or 3) this is a great pump. I didn't know how to use it at first but after calling Medela's customer support line I was able to use it easily. I didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout the day (Your hands would hurt). But other than that I think is a great pump for the price
