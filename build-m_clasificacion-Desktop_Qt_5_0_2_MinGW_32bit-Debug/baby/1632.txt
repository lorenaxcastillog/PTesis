 I absolutely LOVE this stoller. I bought it because I am tall and my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller was causing back pain and I kept kicking the wheels while pushing. This stroller is SO much more comfortable to push. The fabric breathes easily and my daughter doesn't complain when she has to get strapped in. The only drawback is there is no cupholder. I tried to get a generic one to attach, but then the folder wouldn't fold up. arg. All in all, totally worth the investment
