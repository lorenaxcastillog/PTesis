 For safety reasons I was reluctant to purchase a bumper. After looking at this one in person and seeing that it had ties on top and bottom I decided to purchase it. My daughter did fine without it but I like the color it brought to the crib. I wanted her to be able to see the cute animal design so I have the pattern facing in toward her. Her crib has a drop down side so I have the bumper pad running across the back and ends of the crib. I took the excess pad and wrapped it back around the outside of each crib end and tied it. None of the solid blue shows. I am very pleased with the quality of this bumper pad and highly recommend it
