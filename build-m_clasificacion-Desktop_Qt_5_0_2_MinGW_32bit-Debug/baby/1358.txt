 This bouncer model is the best available currently on the market, even though there are few flaws and room for improvement, as other Amazonians pointed out. But it does work and keeps our baby entertained, while leaving parents some much needed time for other important things around the house. Sounds and lights are easily activated by baby's movement, but volume can not be adjusted. Vibration mode could keep baby amuzed for about 1/2 hour first month, but later our baby got used to it and does not care for it as before. We also like to use this bouncer without play bar, as simple comfy chair. This way baby could listen & see parents or watch together 'Baby First' TV. I higly recommend this product to new parents or as baby shower gift
