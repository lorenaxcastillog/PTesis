 My daughter is a child with many developmental delays. At a year old she can only sit up with assistance. The bouncy seats are only meant to hold a child up to 25 lbs! Zoe still needed a chair to sooth and keep her out of harms way. I searched and found only two seats on the market. This one and the Fisher-price one. This one was perfect. Not only is it cushy and comfortable, it has many features. The toys on the side are convenient because my little can only reach to the side (instead of straight in front or overhead). Also, it is easier to lift her out because they don't get in the way. The variety of soothing sounds, levels of volume, and the vibrating features are all a wonderful addition to this rocker! This rocker is intended to be a long lasting item since it holds up to 40lbs. My three year old even sits in it from time to time!
