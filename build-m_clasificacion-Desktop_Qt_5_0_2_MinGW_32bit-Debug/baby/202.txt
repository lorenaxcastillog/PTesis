 I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks. At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it
