 I have never written a review before, but after 4 months of using the Flash EX stroller I have to encourage more users! I have tried others' car seat strollers and they are not nearly as light and easy as this one. I love that it folds in thirds, because you can travel with it in your car AND it fits into the overhead compartment on an airplane, which means that it won't suffer the insults from baggage handling. I use it with the Safe Seat, which fits wonderfully without any adjustments (just use the seatbelt!). The only downside is that the underside basket is small, but I think the small portability and ease of use (including the carrier strap) makes it very worthwhile. My favorite baby purchase so far
