 I was afraid to order this chair at first, too. But mine came in yesterday and I am ordering 4 more! It is very sturdy and is easy to put on the table. I was worried about the kids pushing it off from underneath with their feet, but it has some adjustments under there to secure it to the table. There is also a button on each side to fold down the screw adjustment and just slide it off the table. It also folds flat. This is great for my grandkids and we can always be assured of a clean chair for them when dining out! The colors aren't pretty, but it is washable
