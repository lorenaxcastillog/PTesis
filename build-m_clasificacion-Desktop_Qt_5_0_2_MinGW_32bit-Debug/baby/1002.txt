 I bought these blocks when my son was a month old, he is now almost 7 months old and he loves them. The blocks are designed in bright and attractive colours that easily catch your baby's eye. When baby starts to pick up and play they will discover that each block has different textures and fabrics to help develop baby's touch and they also have a unique feature too. Red and Blue are rattles, Yellow's duck quacks and behind the sun is a tiny mirror and Green's frog vibrates when you pull his leg. These blocks by Baby Einstein are a great buy at a $10 value, they will keep your baby entertained and happy
