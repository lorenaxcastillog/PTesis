 The angle of the rear wheels and the handles make walking comfortable if you're a taller parent (unlike really cheap umbrella strollers). It folds up very small, so it's easy to throw on the floor of the back seat if you don't have trunk space available. It also has a nice carrying strap so you can throw it over your shoulder like a gym bag, which was nice when I walked from my office to day care several blocks away. I always recommend this to my friends for ease of use and good value
