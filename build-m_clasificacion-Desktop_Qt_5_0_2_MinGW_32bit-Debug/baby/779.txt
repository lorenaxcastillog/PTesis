 I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a "tailgate" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to "pump and dump". I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!
