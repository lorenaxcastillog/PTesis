 This stroller is wonderful. I initially bought it strictly for travel but love its ease of use so much that it is used daily. Pros: Lightweight, great carrying strap, easily folds, takes up very little space in your trunk, and the turquoise is a great unisex color. Cons: once it is folded you can not lean it up against something without it falling. With the carrying strap this is not a big deal. This is a very minor issue that does not keep me from recommending this stroller to all my friends and family.
