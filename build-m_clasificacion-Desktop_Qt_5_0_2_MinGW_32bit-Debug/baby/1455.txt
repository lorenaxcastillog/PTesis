 When I got this pump, it was because I was a single mother and my mom wanted to give me a night off once in a while. I chose this one because I orginally intended to only use it occasionally and I didn't have much money. Then I developed a Candida (yeast) infection in my nipples that simply would not go away. Nursing was too painful, but pumping was bearable, so in an effort to continue providing the milk nature helped me make I used this pump. Sure, the suction wasn't industrial-strength, and I had to do one breast at a time. However, the pump did the job in almost the same amount of time my son finished his bottles, and I was even able to pump a little extra for longer-term storage. I was able to use this pump with steady efficiency for two months straight...and my son never once had any formula. If you are planning on returning to work, I do not recommend you purchase this particular pump. Go ahead and get yourself the time-saving double pump. However, if you really are going to use this just occasionally, I would recommend this product
