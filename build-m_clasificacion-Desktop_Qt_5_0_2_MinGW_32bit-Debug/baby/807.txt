 I can't tell you how much I love this product!!! I live in Colorado and we've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now I can't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit. It's so easy to slip her right it, zip it up and go! I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down--this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy. I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked, but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better. First, it washes beautifully! The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it--unlike sherpa fleece. Second, the outside fabric is waterproof. Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off! It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain
