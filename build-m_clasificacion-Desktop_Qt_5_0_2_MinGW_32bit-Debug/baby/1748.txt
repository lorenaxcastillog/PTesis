 At first we thought that an audio monitor would work out for us. Then we found out our son had reflux and we had a scary incident with him choking. Soon after we received the hand held color monitor as a gift and we were able to sleep at night knowing we could peak at the monitor all night if we wanted to. Our floors are very noisy, so sneaking into his room to check on him would wake him most of the time. To us, this is a must have and I highly recommend. This product has worked out perfect, I can not think of a negative. Even though we received this as a gift, I would pay for the $ for it
