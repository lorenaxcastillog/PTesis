 I bought this mirror because it was on sale and I'm glad I did. The mirror is very large and I can see my son clearly without having to shift or strain like I did with a previous mirror. The colours are also bright and attractive and get his attention as soon as I put him in the seat, he seems to talk to the butterfly incessantly. Although It does not play music and light up like some other mirrors, he has a few car seat toys that will also distract him well enough when he looses interest in the mirror. I gave it only four stars because it was a bit difficult to install in my particular car. My middle seat does not have a headrest to attach it to , nor does it have a latch so I had to resort to using some pins to keep it in place. But all in all a great item.
