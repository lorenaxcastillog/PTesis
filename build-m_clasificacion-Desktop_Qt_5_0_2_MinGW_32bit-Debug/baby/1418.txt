 I had actually registered for this warmer, then I had read the reviews, so I decided to take it off of the registry because they were not so good. I still recieved this as a gift anyway and thought that I would return it. My husband had taken it out of the box already and had set it up so I decided we would try it. I actually like this warmer alot. I have had no problem with my wipes being cooked. I make sure there is enough water in the resevoir, which by the way doesn't have to be filled that often and the wipes are nice and warm for baby. I also lik the little light on the front of the warmer.
