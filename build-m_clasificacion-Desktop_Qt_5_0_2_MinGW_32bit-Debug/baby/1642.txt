 This is one of my favorite gifts to buy new moms...they'll get more use out of this gift than just about anything I can think of! Not only is it easy to use, it's dishwasher safe, it can fit just about anywhere, you can store anything in it, the colors are bright and kids like to play with them. I think it's also economical and enviornmentaly friendly since ziplock baggies are so expensive you'll end up saving a lot of money by using the snap apart dish. The best part is that these hold up really well while keeping your snacks/food fresh...I just love these!!
