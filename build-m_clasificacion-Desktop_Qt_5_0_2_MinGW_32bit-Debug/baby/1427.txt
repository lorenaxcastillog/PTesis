 When I first bought this for my son he was around 4-5 months old. I was disappointed at first because he did not like it. He would sceam when I put him in it. I thought, wasted money. Every week I started to put him in it more, and he finally figured out around 6 months how to jump in it. Now it's his favorite activity. He jumps himself silly, and loves to play with all the toys. He spends most of the time trying to get the parrot on top. Highly recommend. Just give them time to adjust and be big enough to use it.
