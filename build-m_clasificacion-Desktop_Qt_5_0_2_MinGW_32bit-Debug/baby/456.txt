 I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it. I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use. So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth. If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design. I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
