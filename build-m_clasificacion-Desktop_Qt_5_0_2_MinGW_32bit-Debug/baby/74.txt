 I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.
