 The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo. I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries. However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem. There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front. So, I have no problem with the seller.
