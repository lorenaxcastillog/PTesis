 This nursing bra is extremely comfortable, ONCE you get it on. It is difficult to get over the chest and back. You practically need 5 hands because it tends to roll under as you're pulling it down your back. I've been wearing it during my pregnancy, I can't imagine how much more difficult it may be to put on when my breasts have grown after the delivery. I give it 4 stars though for it's comfort. Once it's on you hardly know you're wearing a bra, and the snaps have been easy to undo and resnap with one hand. Because they are plastic snaps though, I'm wondering how long they will last with 7-8 feedings a day. I will write more on this once the baby arrives (5 more weeks!)
