 I like the avent bottles a lot... the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in, without getting it all over the counter. I don't think these bottles seem to help my son with gas, he's just a baby, and they are generally gassy. The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first. Overall I've been pretty happy with them though, I've never contempated switching. **I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles... My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz, so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles, we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle. I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz
