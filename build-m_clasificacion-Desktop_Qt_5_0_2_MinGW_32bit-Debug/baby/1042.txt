 I purchased two big boy potty books that arrived a few days before this potty did. We had a different potty that did not work well for boys at all. Once this potty got here he has not had one accident!!! He just turned two yesterday and he loves his potty! He gets excited every time he goes and claps for himself proclaiming that he is a big boy!!! I would highly recommend this potty!!!! Don't keep searching buy this one! I threw his other potty right in the garbage
