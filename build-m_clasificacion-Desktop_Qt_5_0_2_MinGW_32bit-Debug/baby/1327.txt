 We left our hand-me-down pack and play at our parents house. We were going away before we could get it back from them so we quickly ordered a this one. Having watched our first child barely fit in our first one (which was a rectangle) as she grew, we were happy to see how spacious this square version was. It looks like an old fashion play pen. Our second child has PLENTY of room to grow and even at 8 months was taken by all the stuff on the sides. That said, space comes with a price- it weighs about 22lbs. So, we did have to wrestle it through the airport and onto the plane for our trip. But, in the end, would I buy it again? Yes, the space is worth it
