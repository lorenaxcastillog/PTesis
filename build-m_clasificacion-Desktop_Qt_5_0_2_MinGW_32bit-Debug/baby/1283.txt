 This carrier is very easy to use without additional adult help. The straps are soft, easy to adjust and it's simple to clean (lots of slobber from my son chewing on the flap when forward facing). My lower back begins to hurt after about an hour with this on but I can't imagine any front carrier is going to feel all that good after that long. I am not rating this a 5 simply because it's expensive. I would recommend trying on a few more inexpensive brands if price is an issue
