 As soon as I saw it I fell in love with it. I bought it for my baby's room thinking it would only shine the stars on the ceiling, but after receiving it not only shines on the ceiling, but the walls too. It is real soft and light weight and at night the stars give off just enough light to make any child feel comfortable. The amber light is not that bright but the other colours are vibrant. This is a great product that I would recommend to anyone.
