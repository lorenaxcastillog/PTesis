 If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product
