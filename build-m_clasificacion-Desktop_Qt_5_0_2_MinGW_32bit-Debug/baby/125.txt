 This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc. However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue
