 Well, they say that you get what you pay for. That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less! If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine. If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this. Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board. Several pieces arrived damaged. We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it. If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart. Also, the drawers are very shallow. Don't expect to store much in this. It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it
