 We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference. Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours. We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows... I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying
