 You said it New Mommy from Maryland, I can't understand the below comments. This product is a must have, do yourself a huge favor and buy two of them, trust me you will only thank yourself at 2am! Worth every penny! After washing mine they smelled like downey and felt soft. My crib mattress fits so snug and tight that I can't lift it out of the crib to put a new crib sheet on the mattress. I have had mine for 3 years now and they have held up very well
