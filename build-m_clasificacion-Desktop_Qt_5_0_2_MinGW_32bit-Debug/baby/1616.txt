 My son is now 6 1/2 months old and he loves it. He kicks away at it until he tires himself out. It is a bit heavy and you must make sure you tie it tight so that it doesn't fall or get pulled off. The sound has 2 settings, low and high. I read the review that said it was very low, i suspect it might have been on the low setting. Overall, i'd like to see a better way to secure it to crib but my son loves it
