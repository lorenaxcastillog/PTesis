 Though this potty is nicely priced, it's worth it to buy a more expensive one. Though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers, it does shift around on the base, allowing for spillage. The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat, so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside, not just in the receptacle. The inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it's impossible to clean messes out of it. It does serve it's purpose as a potty, but I'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one
