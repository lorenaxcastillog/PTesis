 We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars. It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc. We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid. Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model. WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER. As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it. I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model. This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it. HORRIBLE
