 I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom. I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay. I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!
