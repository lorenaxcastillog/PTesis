 I spent a lot of time researching double stollers and even test drove as many as I could and the BOB is super! It really does turn on a dime and is extremely easy to push. I have twins so getting outside for a jog/walk is crucial to keeping my sanity and shape. It is pricey, but comparitively extremely durable, easy to fold, feels a lot lighter than it appears, and I lOVE the separate sun canopies. The ride is very smooth (due to the shocks) even on bumpy terrain.
