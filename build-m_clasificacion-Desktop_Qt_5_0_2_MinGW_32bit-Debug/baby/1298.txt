 After looking at all of the options, we decided on this car seat carrier. It is perfect! First, it is the lightest and least bulky of all of the carriers. It folds up into nothing and makes for a very maneuverable stroller. Second, it has great suspension that is more forgiving over rough surfaces. Third, it is by far the most sleek and stylish car seat carrier available. I'm not one to write reviews of products, but I felt compelled to write something since we have used this carrier every day for the last 3 mos, and it is one of the most useful things we own. You won't be disappointed
