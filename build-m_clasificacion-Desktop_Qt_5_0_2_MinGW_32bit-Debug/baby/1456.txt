 I have had many stroller over the span of the last 7 years and 3 children and this is the best one yet. So easy to push and isn't so wide that you can't fit through the doorway but wide enough so the kids don't fight. My oldest even jumps on the front wheel cover (I know he shouldn't but what are you going to do) and I can comfortably push all three. love it. love it. love it. Get this stroller if you are looking for one
