 This Baby monitor is working very well for us. I looked a long time for the imho simple features of a) three units - 1 each for mom, baby and dad b) the ability to talk to each of them. The Connection is good, very faint noise, if you crank up the volume. Downsides: A little annoying is the loud beep you hear before speaking. And the rechargable battery (on the two parents units) don't hold very long. After a couple of months of use, we have to recharge them now every three days - we use them about 4 hours a day. The baby unit has no battery, but I don't think that's a problem. Still, the best monitor I could find :
