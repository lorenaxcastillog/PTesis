 We bought this mattress for my daughter 3 years ago when she was 6 months old, and it's now on her toddler bed! It has survived uncountable jumping sessions and has been SO easy to clean - literally just a soapy spongeing does the job. It finally got a tiny split in the vinyl cover, but I put a two inch piece of duct tape over it, put on the sheet and it's back in business! When we do replace it, we'll just get another Pediatric 1000. An excellent value
