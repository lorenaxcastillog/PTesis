 This gate is easy to install and simple to operate once you get the hang of how it works. My son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates (he's broken two already...) and so far, this one's holding up. I would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it doesn't have an installation kit, but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well. It swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut... we use ours in the kitchen so it doesn't wake the babies up- however, if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping, it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep. All in all, it's a really good deal and I would highly recommend this product
